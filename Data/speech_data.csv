108095,Address by Member of the Presidency of BiH Dr Denis Bećirović on the Occasion of the Unveiling of the Monument “Flower of Srebrenica” at the United Nations Square in Vienna,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=108095&langTag=en-US,2025-10-24,"Honourable Mothers of Srebrenica, esteemed families of the victims of genocide, Excellencies, Eminences, lLadies and gentlemen, it is my honour to address you on behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with sincere gratitude for demonstrating solidarity and profound respect for the victims of genocide here in the capital of the Republic of Austria.
Today is an important day for Bosnia and Herzegovina, for Europe, and for the world.
Today, in the friendly Republic of Austria — in one of Europe’s and the world’s cultural capitals, the city of Vienna — we are unveiling a monument to the victims of genocide.
The genocide against Bosniaks was committed in and around Srebrenica, within a United Nations (UN) safe area. Therefore, it carries deep symbolism that this monument is being unveiled at the UN Square and on the UN Day.
From Vienna, we are sending a global message that the victims of genocide are not forgotten — and that the deniers of truth will not prevail.
This monument stands in the service of truth, justice, and the prevention of future evil.
I extend special respect to the “Mothers of Srebrenica,” who have been fighting for truth and justice for decades.
The Mothers of Srebrenica are Bosnian and European heroines.
Their courage and unbreakable spirit serve as an inspiration to all of us.
The strength of the heroines of Srebrenica and Podrinje reminds us that even in the darkest moments, love is stronger than hatred, and truth is stronger than lies.
I thank the Republic of Austria for its support in the adoption of the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica at the UN General Assembly.
As a person who led the complex process of adopting that Resolution, I feel both a human and political obligation to express my gratitude to the friendly Republic of Austria for its support in this historic achievement.
I also thank President Dr Alexander Van der Bellen and the friendly people of the Republic of Austria for the comprehensive assistance their country has provided to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I express my deep gratitude to the Mayor of Vienna, Dr Michael Ludwig, without whose help we would not be unveiling this monument today.
I am also grateful to the Bosnian and Herzegovinian diaspora in Austria, which continues to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria — particularly to the members of associations within the Consilium Bosniacum Alliance.
I thank everyone who, in any way, contributed to the realization of this important project.
Thank you for helping to embed the truth about the genocide against Bosniaks into Austria’s and Europe’s collective memory.
Between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Austria, there exists deep historical, cultural, and other ties — written into our architecture, art, education, and many other fields.
During the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Austria opened its doors to many refugees and displaced citizens of our country.
Bosnia and Herzegovina deeply values the selfless assistance of the Republic of Austria.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The monument we are unveiling today stands as a warning to future generations — never to accept lies instead of truth,
and always to respect the final judgments of UN courts.
I call on the democratic world to support Bosnia and Herzegovina more decisively on its Euro-Atlantic and European path.
This is a geopolitical investment in collective European security.
It is a shared interest of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Austria.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Through the culture of remembrance, we defend the idea of a democratic Europe.
I thank the friendly Republic of Austria for preserving the truth about the genocide committed against the Bosniaks.
May the friendship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Austria live forever!
Thank you for your attention!"
108091,"The Chair of the Presidency of BiH, Željko Komšić, attended the unveiling ceremony of the monument ""Flower of Srebrenica"" in front of the UN building in Vienna, on the occasion of United Nations Day",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=108091&langTag=en-US,2025-10-24,"The monument, symbolizing remembrance, truth, and a warning to humanity, was erected with the support of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Austria, and organized by the Alliance of Bosnian Associations in Austria ""Consilium Bosniacum.""
In his address to those gathered, the Chair of the Presidency of BiH, Željko Komšić, emphasized that the United Nations Square is the most fitting place for a monument to the victims of the Srebrenica genocide, and that it is the duty of all to preserve the memory of the victims and ensure that such crimes never happen again.
""Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is an honour to be here with you today in Vienna, as you unveil the monument ‘Flower of Srebrenica.’
The United Nations Square in Vienna is the most appropriate place in this city for such a monument to be built — for many reasons, both positive and negative. Let us begin with the positive ones.
The fact is that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by a decision of the United Nations, and that it both de facto and de jure represented a Court of the United Nations.
That Court established judicial truth about a number of facts and events that occurred in July 1995 within the so-called UN ""safe area"" of Srebrenica — events that were legally qualified as genocide against the Bosniaks of the Srebrenica enclave.
The UN Court also determined, based on facts, the nature of the crimes that preceded the genocide — crimes that had been continuously committed from 1992 until the final genocidal operation in July 1995.
This judicially established truth, through verdicts for genocide and for crimes against humanity, is now known worldwide. In many countries, genocide denial in Srebrenica is not only socially unacceptable but also punishable by law.
The genocide in Srebrenica has become a historical precedent in Bosnian history, as it marks the first time that an attempt to annihilate a people on such a scale has been documented and institutionally memorialized.
Even earlier in our history, similar crimes and massacres occurred — but this is the first time that those who were direct victims of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been able, in their own country and their own state, to record what was done to them and to remember it in different ways.
The role and assistance of the United Nations Court in this was enormous — I would even say decisive.
Unfortunately, there is also the negative, darker side of the overall role of the United Nations in the genocide in Srebrenica, which we must never forget. That is one of the main reasons why we are unveiling this monument here today.
It is also a fact that the United Nations, as the leading international institution, bears direct responsibility for the genocide in Srebrenica.
By proclaiming Srebrenica a protected zone under its authority, and declaring demilitarization that in practice meant disarming only the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina — but not the forces of the Army of Republika Srpska — the United Nations enabled the genocidal operation of July 1995.
The Dutch UN battalion served as an assistant in carrying out the genocide against the Bosniaks of Srebrenica and Podrinje, just as the Ukrainian UN contingent was responsible for the death of Commander Avdo Palić in Žepa.
That act of cowardice, the weakness of the UN forces, and their alignment with the perpetrators faithfully reflect the role of the UN military presence — demonstrating that their attitude toward the Bosniaks of Srebrenica was not an exception, but rather the rule.
As a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a Bosnian and Herzegovinian, I am proud that my country did not stand on the side of crimes and genocide taking place in the world today.
One often hears, from many sides, that it is neither wise nor prudent to take sides in international conflicts.
But where conflicts go beyond military clashes and become attacks on the unarmed and the innocent, then taking sides is not a question of wisdom — it is a question of character, morality, and human dignity.
That is why I am proud that we condemned the genocide against the Palestinians, as well as the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
We do not believe we can correct all the world’s injustices — we are not that naïve.
We must, above all, look after our own interests — the security and stability of our state — but our clear stance toward injustice committed against others gives us the moral right to stand here today with our heads held high, remembering Srebrenica and all that was done to Srebrenica and to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are also here to send a clear message: never again will we allow the fate of the people of our country to be placed in the hands of anyone outside of ourselves.
We will build good relations with all states that are friendly toward our homeland.
With those that are not, we will strive to maintain correct relations — but never again will we trust in foreign guarantees or foreign protection.
Our bloody history has taught us that lesson.
Thank you for your attention."""

The Chairman of the Presidency of BiH, Željko Komšić, addressed the participants of the Summit.
""Thank you for the invitation to another gathering of the Brdo Brijuni Process, this time in Durres.
We have more or less permanent topics for our discussions: European integration, Growth Plan, youth and brain drain, regional cooperation and regional security.
I want to repet again that European integration is still our path and our goal, regardless of various disappointments. Disappointments that are mutual, both European and ours.
For some time now, it seems that the EU and we from the Western Balkans often operate on ""different frequencies"". The EU says it wants us to join, we say we want the same, but in reality it all looks like we are talking and thinking about completely different things.
The generation from our region that embarked on European integration with hope at the beginning of this century is already approaching to the end of its working life.
Two and a half decades later, enthusiasm has been replaced by the fatigue of an entire generation.
Those who have long since stopped accepting small steps in social reforms as normality, reforms that are necessary and that are happening slowly or not at all, are caught up in, so called, the 'brain drain'.
And it cannot be stopped by anything other than changing policies, implementing reforms and changing relations among ourselves, but also by creating a stable region.
A stable region, dedicated to social change and reform, reform wich can create security.
A region without territorial claims, without rattling weapons, without interfering in the internal affairs of other states, without cheap populism.
An unstable region is a source of insecurity, and as such necessarily leads to depopulation and economic decline.
It is pointless to talk about declarative aspirations towards regional cooperation and European integration without a real political consensus on regional cooperation, finding some common economic denominators and leaving the political practices of the past, which lead nowhere.
The declaration proposed at this meeting is good for adoption at this time.
Finally, the declaration does not touch on any issue on which there is no consensus.
But the time is coming when we will have to start answering difficult questions in this format as well.
I suggest that we consider that, to begin with, we can open discussions about possible joint economic projects that cross the borders of our countries. Projects in the field of energy, needed by all of us, can be the beginning of such a practice.
There is interest, both, ours and the interest of potential partners outside our region.
And finally,
Honorable presidents, thank you for your attention and thank you to our host today too!"""
107901,Address by Member of the Presidency of BiH Dr Denis Bećirović at the Summit of Leaders of the Brdo - Brioni Process Countries,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=107901&langTag=en-US,2025-10-06,"Distinguished President Begaj, honourable colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I extend my gratitude to our esteemed hosts from the Republic of Albania for their warm hospitality and excellent organization.
Dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect in our region are more important today than ever before.
Through active participation in regional initiatives, Bosnia and Herzegovina demonstrates that it is a proactive and constructive partner.
In this context, we will continue to actively support regional cooperation, including the Brdo – Brioni Process initiative.
Let me remind you that the foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina toward neighbouring and other countries is based, above all, on respect for independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as on adherence to the fundamental principles of international law.
In the years following the Second World War, only a few believed that the unification of our continent was possible.
European visionaries such as Schuman, Adenauer, and Spinelli showed that the vision of a united Europe is stronger than fear, prejudice, and hatred.
The political wisdom of European leaders turned former enemies into allies who built a unique European project — a symbol of lasting cooperation and strategic vision for Europe.
This important lesson must be understood and applied in our region as well.
We in the Western Balkans must not forget that the process of European integration is a ""two-way street.""
Why a ""two-way street""? Because the path toward the European Union (EU) does not mean only taking money from European funds and development projects. Above all, it means embracing the core European values and standards.
Unfortunately, we are witnessing trends in some countries of the region where European values are being pushed aside, and practices incompatible with modern democracy are being promoted instead. Such a trend must be stopped.
Ladies and gentlemen,
there can be no genuine peace and progress in Southeast Europe without abandoning the idea of creating ""greater states.""
The dangerous idea of redrawing state borders is a threat to both the present and the future. It is high time that all countries in the region understand this.
Our future lies in establishing inter-state relations modelled on those of the EU member states. That must become a genuine commitment. Only in this way can we build peace,
security, and development in our common interest.
The Scandinavian model of cooperation may not be something we can fully replicate in our region, but we can certainly draw positive lessons from it.
The Scandinavian countries recognized the advantages of cooperation and found ways to create an environment for accelerated economic development.
Let us learn from this and similar examples. Let us not repeat the dangerous politics of the 1990s, whose catastrophic consequences we still feel today.
Mutual respect among states is the path that leads toward a stable and prosperous region.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the intensification of the Berlin Process and the implementation of signed agreements bring visible benefits to all countries in the region.
It is time, through concrete action, to open the path toward progress and enable the final remaining ratification of the Agreement on Freedom of Movement with Identity Cards in the Western Balkans. The ratification of this important agreement would facilitate the implementation of other agreements under the Berlin Process as well. It is time to put an end to obstruction and blockade.
We believe that in the period ahead, it is important for all of us to focus on:
- Infrastructure, energy, digital, and economic connectivity between the Western Balkan countries and the EU;
- Improving energy efficiency and capacity building as a response to climate change;
- Accelerating the energy transition toward green sources of energy;
- Intensifying work on the development of the transport network;
- Facilitating access to the EU’s structural and cohesion funds for countries in the enlargement process;
- Creating new jobs and reducing the emigration of young people."

""When you look back from this distance and try to explain to your child what happened, you come to the conclusion that the saying about the miracle of Bosnian and Herzegovinian resistance holds true. I believe there are two miracles of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian resistance. The first miracle is the youth who accepted the fight against a far superior enemy. Without hesitation, they were ready to give their lives – that is a remarkable thing. The second miracle is the organization of the units. When you start to build an army, it is serious work, and we managed to create one. The miracle of resistance in BiH exists; it happened. It marked our generation, and we carry it with pride.
This is about a culture of remembrance, but also about lessons for the new children who have arrived and those who will come. The games around BiH are not over. It is our duty to pass on to our children at least part of the sense of responsibility toward our homeland. What we have is great – we have a state, and we must not allow it to slip through our fingers like sand. That is why it is important for children to learn, to go and see all the places of suffering,'' said Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Željko Komšić."

""President Zelenskyy,
fellow Heads of state,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
President Zelenskyy, thank you for inviting me to take part in the Fifth Crimea Platform Summit.
As you noted in your letter, this is a symbolic year – the 80th anniversary of the United Nations – and we must show that the United Nations is not a symbolic institution and that the Charter of the United Nations is not a symbolic document.
It has never been more important than now to show that we stand behind the elementary political achievements of a civilized society that the Charter of the United Nations has represented for eight decades.
The International Crimea Platform is a platform based on multilateralism, aimed at preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.
The Charter of the United Nations obliges us, as civilized societies, to uphold these timeless, universal principles, which you rightly emphasized in the proposed declaration.
Article 2 of the Charter clearly obliges civilized States Parties to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.
The taking of land from others, the killing of civilians, children, the carrying out of ethnic cleansing or genocide, for any political purpose, national interest or, worse, for business profit, can bring neither happiness nor prosperity anywhere in the world.
I fully support the proposed declaration, which affirms that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force can be recognized as legal anywhere in the world.
Finally, coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which became a member of the United Nations despite the aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide we have suffered, we reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, including its territorial waters.
Never lose hope. Good will always triumph over the forces of evil and destruction.
Thank you!"""

""Dear guests, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to address this gathering at the Harvard Club, among distinguished leaders committed to peace and cooperation.
Today, as we reflect on multilateralism, we draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom of Nizami – a legacy based on dialogue, compassion and justice.
In a world marked by complexity, multilateralism is at a critical crossroads.
We face challenges that no nation can solve alone: ​​resurgences of genocide and conflict that destroy societies, economic inequalities that cause instability, and crises of democracy.
These challenges test the very foundations of international cooperation and require a renewed commitment to collective action.
Bosnia and Herzegovina knows very well the price of division and the value of dialogue.
Our history teaches us to advocate dialogue in a world of multilateralism, not as an abstract idea, but as a practical necessity – a framework through which peace, security and sustainable development can be achieved.
Our generation has entered a dark era, an era of collapsed values ​​of humanism.
It is almost unthinkable that genocide and the deliberate starvation of entire peoples have become part of our daily reality – a ""normality"" that we risk passing on to future generations.
The least we can do is to pass on to these generations the values ​​of empathy and solidarity with all those who suffer. Without this foundation, new generations will not be able to take even the first step towards improving the world we leave them.
Gathered here in New York, a city that symbolizes diplomacy and diversity, let us reaffirm our commitment to the idea of ​​multilateralism that Nizami Ganjavi so powerfully embodied.
As Nizami reminds us: ""In a world filled with harmony, the music of life is sweet."" We must keep in mind the power of this virtue so that we can respond to the challenges of today and build a future in which peace will not be a fleeting hope, but a lasting reality.
Finally, I call on leaders, my colleagues, to remain united at this crossroads. Together, through dialogue, respect, and determination, we can chart a path toward a world with less chaos and more stability and justice.
Thank you."""

""First of all, thank you for the invitation to be with you today, on Vlašić, on the Galice plateau, with the people who won an almost incredible military victory, led primarily by General Alagić. The military significance of that operation, and what it meant in the offensive operations, primarily in Krajina, in the liberation of that part of our country, should be spoken about by those who participated in it, and it is my duty to express my respect for that.
Yesterday I attended the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Ključ. It is certain that even that would have been questionable had it not been for the liberation of the Vlašić plateau. The moral meaning of the liberation of Vlašić at that moment, because of that image when our flag is raised on top of Vlašić, is really difficult to describe to someone who does not belong to that generation. In these thirty years since the end of the war, it seems to me that I understood some things in the correct way only now, and at the age of twenty-eight, when the war started, I did not understand that. I realized that peace is important, that freedom is more important, but that the homeland is the most important. Because without a homeland, you can hardly talk about freedom, and then peace. In the gradation of those values, peace, freedom and homeland, peace can also be sacrificed for the homeland. And a person can sacrifice freedom for the homeland, but he must never sacrifice the homeland, because without it we don't exist.
I like this symbolic handover of war flags. As a generation, we can be proud that we did our best to stand here today, but we haven't done anything if we don't pass on what we know to our children, and that's our duty as elders, as parents, as more experienced and wiser. To point out what kind of place they live in, what kind of beauty, after all, they live in, and what this generation has done means, not so that they would respect it, not so that they would admire us, but only so that they would learn something. That is why this symbolism of the handing over of war flags by veterans to our future should be a kind of process of passing on knowledge, experiences and our expectations. It is our obligation to leave these children as a legacy, to tell them that BiH, when it has existed for a thousand years as our homeland, must continue to exist forever, while it is of this world."""

“Esteemed conference organizers, esteemed participants, ladies and gentlemen, respected members of the academic and professional community,
It is my pleasure to greet you tonight and address you at the Third Congress of Endoscopic Surgeons of Bosnia and Herzegovina with international participation.
I am pleased that Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are hosting this exceptional professional gathering, which brings together the best experts in endoscopic surgery from the country, the region and the world.
Today, in a time of rapid technological progress, it is important that Bosnia and Herzegovina also keeps pace with global standards – not only through professional and scientific gatherings like this one, but also through systemic support for education, research and development of the healthcare sector.
Unfortunately, we are aware that our healthcare system, like many other sectors, is going through challenging transitions.
In this regard, your profession – highly specialized and demanding – plays a key role in laying the foundation for the modernization and improvement of healthcare in our country, where endoscopic surgery should be the gold standard, recognizing its benefits for the patient, but also for the healthcare system in general.
I believe that your work and this conference, in addition to the exchange of professional knowledge and experiences, will be an incentive for new initiatives, cooperation and ideas that will improve both endoscopic surgery and the entire healthcare system of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I wish you successful work and a pleasant stay in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, I am glad to see some of the doyens of laparoscopic surgery in Bosnia and Herzegovina here among you. Please do not hold it against me, but I must single out a man whom I greatly respect when we talk about work in this field - primarius doctor Mirsad Granov, and from this place I would like to express special respect and gratitude, both to him and to all of you, for everything you do for the benefit, primarily of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also of the profession and science.

The heroic Bužim raised famous Bosnian knights. Among them is the hardened Krajina and Bosnian warrior, our hero of the defence and liberation war, the Golden Lily and General Izet Nanić. He is one of the greatest heroes in the millennial history of the Bosnian state. We will forever remember General Nanić and all Bosnian heroes. Their war heroism is a lasting role model for current and future generations. We are proud of the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We do not allow anyone to question the honourable fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no discussion, no bargaining about that. Never!
Greater-state protagonists are trying to deprive Bosnia and Herzegovina of its right to exist. However, they fail to break the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has not been permanently subdued even by much stronger forces in the last 1,000 years. Bosnia and Herzegovina has always had its sons and daughters who will protect it. That's how it was and that's how it will stay.
Our task is to strengthen the foreign policy position of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must strengthen alliances around the world. Let's strengthen old friendships and build new ones wherever we can. The General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted the Resolution on July 11 as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica. Many thought that we would never see the adoption of this resolution. Although we were in a completely unequal position, we showed that we know how to win. Bosnia and Herzegovina can win. This is one of the most important diplomatic and political victories of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 21st century. In order to continue winning, we must be serious, hardworking, united and determined.
Because of the adoption of the Resolution and the policy of protecting our country, I am exposed to attacks by the leaders of Serbia and their regime media. They are bothered by the truth and arguments. They would prefer us to remain silent. We will not remain silent. We will fight for truth and justice. We will not justify ourselves to those who are trying to undermine Bosnia and Herzegovina. And let them remember that well!
Regime political and media circles from Serbia say that I initiated the adoption of the Resolution on the Genocide in Srebrenica. I admit it, I did. They say that I am responsible because I led the process of adopting the Resolution on the Genocide in Srebrenica. That is right, I led that process. The President of Serbia publicly says that ""cooperation with Bećirović is impossible"". I am telling him from Bužim: equal cooperation is possible with me, but it is not possible to humiliate Bosnia and Herzegovina with me. It cannot be! Period!
The best sons and daughters have been guarding our country for centuries. We will guard what is ours in the times to come. Some ask us: What is ours? Ours is what the whole world has recognized and what was permanently sealed in the UN on May 22, 1992. The planetary certificate of statehood, independence and sovereignty has not been issued to any entity, district, canton, city or municipality. There is only one certificate in the UN, only one address, only one name – that is the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We serve it. We fight for it."

It is my sincere pleasure to welcome you to the opening of the Eastern European Summer School on Machine Learning here in Sarajevo.
I am especially pleased that this prestigious educational program, which brings together more than 350 participants from over 50 countries around the world, will be held for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina, after several countries in the region.
The fact that the Eastern European Summer School on Machine Learning is being held right here in Sarajevo this year is a strong recognition of our country and its growing potential in science, technology and education. Your presence in Sarajevo sends a strong message of support for the development of science, research and new technologies in our country and the region.
Artificial intelligence represents one of the key development points of modern society, and for Bosnia and Herzegovina it opens up the possibility of building a more sustainable and competitive future through knowledge and innovation. In this context, events like this do not only mean the exchange of knowledge – they create a new generation of leaders and experts ready to shape the world we live in.
For Bosnia and Herzegovina - a country rich in talented, educated and creative young people, this is an opportunity to keep up with global trends and build a more sustainable, modern and competitive future through knowledge, innovation and cooperation.
A summer school like this one does not only serve to transfer knowledge - it creates a space for networking, inspiration and development of future leaders in the field of technology. Therefore, I would like to especially thank the organizers, lecturers, partners and everyone who made it possible for this exceptional initiative to be held right here.
To you, dear participants, I wish successful work, useful knowledge and that you ultimately take away beautiful memories from Sarajevo and our Bosnia and Herzegovina.

107153,"Address by Member of the Presidency of BiH, Dr Denis Bećirović, on the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the commemoration of the victims of serious war crimes with elements of genocide in Prijedor",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=107153&langTag=en-US,2025-07-20,"Respected families of victims, surviving camp inmates, representatives of victims' associations, esteemed Reisu-l-ulema Kavazović, representatives of the executive and legislative branches, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, today, in Kozarac, we pay tribute to the civilian victims of serious war crimes committed in Prijedor and the Sana Valley.
We are here to pay our respects and to bow to the shadows of more than 3,176 innocently murdered civilians, including 102 murdered children.
Crimes against humanity and other war crimes committed in this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina are among the most serious war crimes in Europe since World War II.
War crimes were committed as part of a large-scale project of aggression against the independent, sovereign and internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We remember and have an obligation to speak about it, write about it, but also to take actions that will lead to the punishment of all war criminals.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has proven that serious war crimes, characterized as crimes against humanity, were committed against civilians in Prijedor and the surrounding area.
In its verdict against Radovan Karadžić, the Hague Tribunal clearly established that Prijedor was ""one of the centres of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina"". I quote: ""The municipality of Prijedor was a place where Bosniaks and Croats were systematically killed, imprisoned and persecuted with the aim of their permanent removal.""
To the whole world, on the 33rd anniversary of the crimes against humanity in Prijedor, we want to say: We will never give up on searching for our missing! We will never stop prosecuting war crimes.
In Prijedor and its surroundings, the non-Serb population was forced to wear white armbands.
They marked this population as in the darkest days of European history.
This must not be forgotten.
The criminal ideology cantered on blood, soil, and the idea of a heavenly people has always brought unprecedented suffering and misery.
Where the ideology of a greater Serbia has prevailed, death has also prevailed.
Evil must not be forgotten or underestimated.
On November 20, 1945, the famous American prosecutor Robert H. Jackson gave one of the most important courtroom speeches in history in Nuremberg.
On that occasion, he said, among other things: ""The crimes we are trying to condemn and punish were so evil and with such devastating effects that human civilization could not tolerate them, leave them unnoticed, otherwise it could not survive such a repetition.""
Even today, well-intentioned people are obliged to say, like Prosecutor Jackson, that we mus not forget the war crimes committed in Prijedor and the Sana River Valley, because the path from oblivion to their repetition is short.
It is our duty to be the voice of those who are no longer here and to fight for their dignity.
We have the strength to speak without hatred, knowing that hatred is the most obvious sign of powerlessness.
People of good will must fight against hatred, prejudice and stigmatization of other people just because they are of different religious, ethnic or other affiliations.
Dear all,
In the next 100 years, the vast archive of the courts in The Hague will be one of our most important books of collective memory.
In this archive there are millions of printed pages, audio and video recordings that are important not only for preserving the truth, but also for understanding our reality.
That is why, for more than two years, I have been working intensively to ensure that the United Nations (UN) reaches a just solution and that the original archive of the Tribunal is stored in Sarajevo - the capital of our state.
We need long-term strategies, policies and actions that have long-term value for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We must all be guardians of the truth!
The fight for truth does not last one day a year. It is continuous and is conducted in various areas: passing and enforcing laws, in education, in institutions, in every memorial, every textbook, every classroom...
By advocating the truth, we make the best contribution to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let's not forget, killing the truth is killing both the past and the future.
We are against hatred, we advocate peace and tolerance.
We are against forgetting, we affirm memory.
We remember, because if we stop remembering, evil can happen to us again.
Our memory is not a matter of simple choice, it is fatefully important for us.
Dear all,
it is our moral obligation to remember all those killed and to honour them in a dignified manner.
Civilized countries learn and draw long-term lessons.
We must never stop telling the truth about the innocent victims of Prijedor and the Sana Valley!"

He also pointed out that Turkish people then showed their will to defend their choice, and therefore defended their right to decide who will work on their behalf in the Republic of Turkey.
""No force, no matter what it was, could change their will. And we in Bosnia and Herzegovina can learn a lot from the Turkish people, that no one can cancel or change our democratically made decision. The question is what would Turkey be like today and what would the Islamic world be like today, and what would its attitudes be if the coup had succeeded. That's why I want to congratulate Turkish people and wish them a lot of success in the future,"" said BiH Presidency member Željko Komšić at the end of his address."

With sorrow and respect, we lay to eternal rest the remains of seven more innocent victims of the genocide against the Bosniaks, and we express our deep sympathy with the families of the victims of the genocide.
Three days ago, in New York, for the first time under the organization of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide was observed.
I thank all the states that supported the adoption of the Resolution, which is important not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina but also for the entire world.
The implementation of the Resolution has begun. In the period ahead, for as long as human civilization exists, the 11th of July will be the International Day of Reflection of the Srebrenica Genocide.
Thirty years have passed since the genocide was committed. It was the culmination of a barbaric aggression against the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thirty years since the conclusion of the joint criminal enterprises against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as established by the judgments of the United Nations court.
Thirty years since unprecedented mass killings, torture, persecution, extermination, deportations and forced transfers, violations of the laws and customs of war, and the spreading of terror among the civilian population.
Thirty years of searching for the remains and exhuming the mass graves of genocide victims.
Thirty years of confronting the horrifying consequences of genocide.
Thirty years of pain, sorrow and suffering.
Thirty years of the fight for truth and justice.
Thirty years of fighting denial and relativization of genocide.
Thirty years of brave and unwavering struggle of the Mothers of Srebrenica.
Thirty years of struggle for a safer future for all people.
Respected guests,
The genocide against the Bosniaks was comprehensively and meticulously planned over many years.
Serbian regime media, for years before the genocide, labeled Bosniaks as “fundamentalists,” “extremists,” “terrorists,” “traitors,” and other derogatory names. Milošević’s regime disseminated poisonous content through mass media. The degree of indoctrination was such that even one member of the Serbian Parliament publicly declared: “For one Serb, a hundred Muslims will be killed.”
A specific objective of the genocidal propaganda was to demonize and compromise Bosniaks in the eyes of the West.
This dirty aim of discrediting the Bosniaks in the West has once again been activated. That is why the West and Bosnia and Herzegovina must this time, seriously and in a timely manner, understand the intentions behind the renewed manipulative and dangerous propaganda, which in the 1990s led to catastrophic consequences.
Unfortunately, in the year when we mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks, we are once again witnessing monstrous and frightening propaganda against Bosnia and Herzegovina - a state that is an important and reliable part of the Global Anti-Terrorism Coalition.
Let us not forget, it was precisely the savage political and media campaign that served as the prelude to the only genocide in Europe after the Second World War - the genocide against the Bosniaks.
The crime of genocide against the Bosniaks was not a historical accident. It was planned, organized, financed, and brutally carried out.
Respected guests,
I know that even today there are those who do not wish to hear the truth about the role of the leadership of the Republic of Serbia, led by Slobodan Milošević, in committing genocide.
My duty is to speak about this publicly.
Therefore, I particularly draw attention to the following facts:
- The aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was launched from Belgrade;
- Without military, logistical, financial and other support from Belgrade, the genocide in and around Srebrenica would not have been possible;
- The personnel policy and activities of the paramilitary so-called Republika Srpska, from 1992 until the end of 1995, were directed from Belgrade, from the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army (VJ);
- The original transcripts of the Supreme Defence Council of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia testify that the then-President of Serbia was aware of the genocide being committed against the Bosniaks;
- At a meeting of the Supreme Defence Council in Belgrade, on the 25th of August 1995, the President of Serbia welcomed war criminal Ratko Mladić as a hero and congratulated him on his “military success”."

For us, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is not merely a policy ambition—it is an imperative for the prosperity, stability, and dignity of our citizens.
At the core of this agenda lies a fundamental question: How do we finance our shared ambitions?
For Bosnia and Herzegovina, this question has become a central tenet of the strategic planning processes within the country, especially in both entities.
Although classified as an upper-middle-income country, we continue to face significant fiscal and structural constraints.
Our per capita investment in the SDGs remains 62 per cent below the average for our income group, while domestic savings hover at approximately 8 per cent of GDP - far from the levels necessary to drive transformative development from within.
Yet, despite these limitations, we have acted decisively.
Over the past three years, the Governments of Republika Srpska, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brčko District, and the Council of Ministers have adopted Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first-ever Sustainable Development Goals Financing Framework.
This is a landmark strategic document that articulates a shared vision for mobilizing new and innovative financial resources in alignment with priorities of different governments in the country.
Developed with support from the United Nations system, this Framework lays out concrete pathways to expand fiscal space and attract sustainable investment, particularly in three priority sectors: clean and affordable energy and infrastructure, digital transformation, and research and development.
It introduces a range of new instruments - green and SDG bonds, strategic investment funds, and energy performance contracting through ESCO models.
It also anticipates the greater deployment of blended finance mechanisms, social impact bonds, and apex financing facilities to unlock the full potential of both domestic and international capital markets.
Beyond proposing tools, the Framework integrates policy, budget, and investment incentives to drive our long-term development goals.
I pleased to report that the Framework is already being translated into action. Feasibility studies for SDG bonds are underway at the entity level. Interest-free loan schemes, co-financed by development partners, are supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in adopting green technologies.
Plans for biodiversity financing and digital transition schemes are being developed to improve our readiness for a sustainable future.
However, let me be clear: financing development is not the sole responsibility of governments. Our success will hinge upon enduring partnerships - with international financial institutions, development partners, and, crucially, the private sector. In this regard, it is essential that our partners understand the unique constitutional architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina – one that is highly decentralized and shaped by the principles of our peace framework.
We seek cooperation that respects this structure and supports our development goals without the intention of altering the constitutional foundation of the country.
We view this conference as an opportunity not only to reaffirm our engagement, but to declare our readiness to lead – constructively, cooperatively and credibly.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The journey to 2030 is not a race between nations. It is a test of our shared resolve, solidarity and vision. Bosnia and Herzegovina may be modest in scale, but is resolute in action. We stand ready to walk this path with all of you - side by side - with purpose and ambition.
Thank you."

Your continued support is proof that truth, justice and the memory of Srebrenica have their enduring allies in the international community.
Thank you to the United Kingdom for the proposed resolution on Srebrenica in 2015, and especially for the great help in preparing and adopting the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in May 2024.
The adopted Resolution has planetary significance. It represents a moral, historical and civilizational act by the UN.
I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina has many friends in the United Kingdom.
I would like to thank them all for their tremendous support. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Chairman of the Remembering Srebrenica Foundation, Waqar Azmi, and to our friends from this foundation.
One great man will forever be etched in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. His name is Lord Paddy Ashdown. On behalf of the citizens of my country, I express my deep respect for this just man.
The United Kingdom has recognized that spreading the truth about the genocide against Bosniaks is not only important for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
In times of complex global relations, it is important to know that the truth has its guardians.
Therefore, it is important that together we:
- strengthen the culture of peace,
- encourage advocates of justice,
- institutionally protect the legacy of the UN courts;
- affirm dialogue;
- condemn the policy of glorifying war criminals;
- and strengthen education systems in the function of genocide prevention.
Unfortunately, as we mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks, we are facing new threats to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Eleven months ago, here in London, I said that continued tolerance of the anti-Dayton and pro-Russian policies of the leadership of Republika Srpska entity could lead to the destabilization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately, these words of mine have proven true.
For almost four months, a brutal attack has been going on against the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The current security crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be understood without knowing the bigger picture.
Moscow has long been working to destabilize the Western Balkans, with the aim of diverting attention from Ukraine. Russia is concretely and strongly supporting its proxies in the region, and in particular the leadership of Republika Srpska entity.
It is no coincidence that Putin has received the president of the Republika Srpska entity twenty-six times. Putin does not receive anyone by chance.
Russia has exploited every weakness of the West. If the danger in Bosnia and Herzegovina is underestimated, Russia will seize this opportunity as well.
The democratic world and Bosnia and Herzegovina must not allow the argument of force to prevail over the argument of law.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thirty years after the genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, my country is once again under serious threat.
The evil that we do not stop at the beginning becomes greater and more dangerous later. Together, let us stop the new evil in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With a culture of remembrance, we fight for democracy and human rights.
Thank you to the United Kingdom for preserving the truth about the genocide in Srebrenica.
We are a country that remembers and values ​​its friends and allies.
Long live the friendship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Kingdom!"

Adress:
Your Eminences,
excellencies,
ladies and gentlemen…
Today, we are standing together in this space of prayer and remembrance, to pay tribute to the innocent victims of the Srebrenica genocide from 30 years ago.
The Srebrenica genocide remains an open wound in the souls of the people, of a generation, of every decent and honest person.
Srebrenica has been reminding us for 30 years that peace is not just the absence of war - peace requires justice and truth, as well as human dignity. That reminder stays put for the generations that will come after us as well.
Today, more than ever, in this world we live in, we must be aware that peace without justice is very often not even peace, but an expectation of new war and suffering.
In this spirit, please allow me to recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
The following message must become our pledge - denial of crimes committed shall never be allowed. Victims shall never be forgotten! The peace shall be built, above all, on the basis of truth, empathy, dignity, and reconciliation!
Here, in the peace of St. Paul’s Cathedral, let us pay tribute to the innocent victims and their families.
Let us wish for the vision of a world in which no one remains silent in the face of injustice, nor surrenders to silence. Let us raise our voice against everything that destroys and degrades human dignity, and causes suffering."

It is my pleasure to greet you tonight and address you on the occasion of the opening of the 12th Gastroenterology Conference, which is dedicated to the great name of BiH medicine, our esteemed Dr Mehmed Gribajčević.
I am glad that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sarajevo are the hosts of this important event that brought together top experts, health workers, researchers and representatives of the academic community, dedicated to one of the most important areas of modern medicine.
This conference once again confirms that Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite the challenges we face, when it comes to gastroenterology, has knowledge, proven experts and a long tradition, and proof of this are many experts such as our esteemed Dr Mehmed Gribajčević.
Today's medicine, as you know best, increasingly relies on innovation and the application of modern technologies, which makes treatment more efficient, faster, more accessible and more comfortable for patients.
These technological advances and their application in modern medicine are not a luxury but a necessity, therefore it is important that Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to move with global trends.
I firmly believe that your work over the next few days, in addition to the exchange of new scientific knowledge and professional experiences, will bring new opportunities and new momentum in the development of medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina, following and applying the latest world standards, and positioning our country as the centre of the region in the application of modern technologies in this branch of internal medicine.
I wish you a pleasant stay in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you for your attention."
106477,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović, at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Gala Dinner on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton P",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=106477&langTag=en-US,2025-05-26,"Honourable Congressman Turner, honourable NATO Secretary General Rutte, esteemed Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank the organizers for the invitation and the opportunity to address you on the occasion of the thirty years since the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Agreement).
On behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I express my gratitude to the NATO member states for their concrete assistance, support and decades of friendship.
Following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina restored its independence in 1992 and became a full member of the United Nations.
During the brutal aggression from 1992 to 1995, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only subject of international law.
The independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state were also confirmed by the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995.
Since the end of the aggression until today, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress.
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina stands at the doorstep of the EU and NATO. These are strategic foreign policy goals, which were unanimously adopted by the state authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, the current implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement has not eliminated the threat of large-state projects and separatist aspirations aimed at the territorial, political, economic and cultural division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the leadership of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entity Republika Srpska (RS) does not respect the Dayton Peace Agreement.
It is a paradox that destructive anti-Dayton activity is reaching its peak precisely at the time of marking the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
The leadership of the RS entity, supported by Moscow and Belgrade, launched a brutal attack on the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of February this year.
This attack on the fundamental provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement is still ongoing and poses a serious threat to peace and stability.
The current problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina is primarily of a security nature.
The Dayton Peace Agreement brought us peace and thank you for that.
Help us defend your legacy and do not allow Russia to open a second front in the Western Balkans.
The security crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a local problem. It is the result of aggressive actions by Moscow through its proxies in the Republika Srpska entity.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot count on long-term stabilization and faster development without changing the constitution.
The following principles should be taken into account in the future process of constitutional transformation of Bosnia and Herzegovina:
Our state needs a comprehensive democratic reform of the entire state, social and economic system, with a goal to make an individual, as a free citizen, the fundamental political subject.
The Constitution of BiH should be based on the principles of civil democracy, with mandatory respect for the multiethnic character of the state.
The priority of all state bodies of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
Finally, it is necessary to strongly oppose any ethnic federalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as additional ethnic divisions.
Our vision is Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single, unified, democratic and legal state, a member of the Euro-Atlantic family of states.
Thank you for your attention!"
106463,Address by Chairwoman and Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović at the Parliamentary Assembly formal dinner marking the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Pea,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=106463&langTag=en-US,2025-05-26,"Mr. President, esteemed members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, dear colleagues heads of state, distinguished guests, it is with deep appreciation—and a sense of responsibility—that I join you here in Dayton, a city that changed our history.
Thirty years ago, the Dayton Peace Agreement ended a devastating war and created a constitutional framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina that reflected the realities of our society. It gave each of its three constituent peoples and two entities the right to self-govern within one state.
Dayton did not erase our differences. It organized them. It did not impose unity. It structured it.
Today, however, that balance is slowly unraveling—not by democratic mandate, but through the actions of unelected international actors who treat Dayton not as a binding agreement, but as a living document to be stretched, reinterpreted, and rewritten—without consent.
The truth is that in the past 30 years Bosnia has been treated as a radical nation building project and this experimental approach has led the country from one crisis to another. Almost all foreign interventions have been carried out without negotiation, without parliamentary process, and without constitutional legitimacy.
And it is fair and suitable to reiterate here in the very city of Dayton that the Dayton agreement never gave the right to any unelected foreign bureaucrat under the title of high representative to impose or amend our laws, to suspend our entity constitutions, to weaponize our legal system to silence and remove from office our democratically elected leaders such as Republika Srpska president Milorad Dodik or to punish our political parties. But all this has been done by Mr. Christian Schmidt and many of his predecessors in the past 3 decades.
The most troubling is the turn toward lawfare—where legitimate political disagreement is answered with criminal charges, indictments, and threats of arrest. I have listened carefully what President Trump, Vice President Vance, Secretary Rubio and just two days ago Deputy Secretary of State Landau have stated. And it is quite clear that the nation building pattern promoted in Bosnia for 3 decades is in contravention with the policy of the new President Trump- led administration. And I want to believe that this administration will help us save democracy in BiH where its future will be written not by decree and foreign dictate but by law and our constitution.
I come from Republika Srpska, and let me emphasize that we are not undermining the Dayton Agreement; we are upholding it. But we do not want to be told how to govern by people who do not vote in our elections, do not speak our languages, and do not bear the consequences of their decrees. One example of our dedication is that November 21st, the day the Dayton Agreement was initialed, is a public holiday in Republika Srpska, but in the other entity, it is a normal working day.
What we do want is to restore Dayton—to return to the agreement as it was signed, not as it is now imagined. That is why Republika Srpska is asking to go back to basics. We are ready to engage in structured dialogue with all parties. If the agreement is to evolve, it must evolve lawfully—through amendment and mutual consent.
We also believe in strategic partnership with the US regarding investment in energy sector, as well as exploitation of the reserves of the critical minerals, grounded in transparency and constitutional law.
In closing, let me emphasize: Peace was possible in 1995 because all the parties were respected and heard. Peace in 2025 will require the same.
Let us recommit - on this anniversary — to what Dayton truly meant: consent, constitutionality, and cooperation among equals. Let us go back to basics—so the next thirty years are better than the last thirty.
Thank you."

I shall not comment on the situation and goals of other countries in the region.
I expect the same attitude towards Bosnia and Herzegovina from the other participants of this gathering.
It needs to be mentioned that today we are in a place that is historically linked to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Once again, I wish to express my gratitude to our hosts, as well as to the people and the government of the United States, for their overall engagement with Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1995 until today!
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country that knows how to appreciate the importance of peace. The majority of people in BiH will do everything to preserve the peace and ensure that future generations of Bosnians and Herzegovinians never learn the horrors that my generation was exposed to.
It seems to me that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina are very much aware that ""the gates of hell are easy to open, but to close that door is very difficult, sometimes even impossible"".
On the other hand, peace, a stable state and a strong society are not granted and not forever.
We need to work on those goals daily. We need to fight for them and protect them.
The Dayton Peace Agreement should also be viewed in this context. It is certain that the DPA can be considered the basis of peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and, indirectly, in the entire region.
From a 30 years' distance, I think we can now correctly estimate the positive achievements of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
However, we also have the right to ask ourselves, whether it’s time to move on.
I know this is a difficult question, full of dilemmas. But, for the sake of the future, we have to ask ourselves this very question. We must try to find an honest answer, an answer beneficial for the future.
Is the constitutional framework provided by the DPA sufficient for our country to move forward?
To be clear, by saying this, I am not implying the opening of the issues of the administrative organization of the country. I know that we cannot reach an agreement on that now, or in the future.
What I am primarily referring to, is the issue of human rights, but also the closely related issue of the rule of law.
The fact is that Bosnia and Herzegovina discriminates against its citizens on identity issues and violates the human rights of its people.
This has been repeatedly established by the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights.
There is no acceptable answer to the question of why this is the case. The simple and logical truth is that correcting this injustice towards the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina will certainly not break and destroy the Dayton Constitution and the constitutional and administrative structure of BiH as regulated by the DPA.
For this reason, I emphasize the need to urgently work on correcting this injustice towards the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is conditio sine qua non for further progress in BiH.
I fear that, without resolving this issue, we will remain permanently turned towards the past and various interpretations of it, without the strength and capacity to leave it behind and turn to the future.
With due respect to the limited presentation time at this session, I will stop here. Thank you, once again, for the invitation and the opportunity to be here today and to speak in this place of great importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Although I currently chair the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I speak to you today in my constitutional capacity as the Serb member of that Presidency—elected by the citizens of Republika Srpska, one of two constituent entities that comprise BiH.
The Dayton agreement was not a perfect solution, but it was an act of courageous diplomacy that balanced three peoples and two entities in one state. It was - and remains, a legally binding treaty, lodged in the annals of this Council, whose Annex 4 is our Constitution and whose Annex 10 defines the mandate of the High Representative.
It created a decentralized, consensus-based system precisely so, that no single actor—domestic or foreign—could dominate the others. Yet today, that balance is being hollowed out by unaccountable foreign intervention either through the actions of various high representatives or foreign judges in the Constitutional Court of BiH.
Allow me to begin where Dayton begins: with the rule of law. Annex 10 is clear when requiring that the High Representative shall be approved by the UN Security Council. This has never happened in Mr’ Schmidt’s case. He was selected by the self-appointed Peace Implementation Council—an informal assemblage with no charter basis, no treaty or legal authority, and no power to override this body. And he has acted based on the so-called Bonn powers that are not codified in any legally binding international instrument.
Some claim that because the PIC “informed” the Council of its selection, confirmation became unnecessary. But if this Council’s vote were unnecessary, Annex 10 would never have required it.
Annex 10 is also clear about the mandate of the High representative. The Dayton Agreement did not authorize the High Representative to legislate, to suspend constitutions, to criminalize elected officials and political parties, or rule by decree.
Yet, that is precisely what Mr. Christian Schmidt and some of his predecessors have done many times.
Here lies the heart of a continual crisis in Bosnia whose culmination we are witnessing today. Everything that flows from that irregularity – lack of UN Security Council confirmation and unlawful impositions beyond the mandate set forth in Annex 10, is infected with the same defect. No legal system—domestic or international—can survive if the interpreters of the rules exempt themselves from the rules.
Let me briefly mention only some of numerous edicts Mr. Schmidt unlawfully issued since arriving in BiH.
1.He unilaterally suspended the Constitution of the Federation of BiH to impose a government he preferred, ignoring the election results.
2. He altered the electoral law bypassing democratic parliamentary procedures,
3. As well, he extended the mandate of the Central Election Commission without legislative approval.
4. He amended the criminal code to criminalize non-compliance with his own decrees—a move to primarily eliminate from political life a democratically elected president of Republika Srpska for fulfilling his constitutional duties to sign laws passed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, but also to intimidate any dissenting officials who would dare challenge his illegitimate rule.
5. He cut public funding to the democratically elected political parties in Republika Srpska cancelling the political will of the vast majority of its voters.
Esteemed members of the Council,
This is neither the Dayton Agreement, nor a democracy, and certainly not the rule of law. It is dictatorship—government by decree, unchecked by courts, devoid of appeal. What started as mere overreach has now solidified into a system of repression.
Each action was justified in the name of “functionality.” Yet the result is not a more cohesive Bosnia; it is a deeply polarized country which can hardly survive this form and extent of foreign intervention.
When Republika Srpska protests such violations, we are unjustly labeled as separatists. However, demanding adherence to international treaties is not separatism.
Contrary to some narratives, Republika Srpska is not undermining the Dayton Agreement—it is upholding it. Our demands do not seek to dismantle Bosnia and Herzegovina but rather to restore the legality and balance originally enshrined in the Dayton framework.
For this reason, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska has enacted legislation to defend its rights within Dayton. These measures are not provocations; they are lawful responses to persistent violations of international law.
The ongoing crisis is neither of Republika Srpska’s making nor in its interest. It has been triggered by Mr. Schmidt’s most expansive and authoritarian use of power, burdening the country with a series of unlawful impositions
Therefore, condemning Republika Srpska’s actions without first addressing Mr. Schmidt’s unlawful interventions is not only misleading but dangerously one-sided.
Allow me to state our position plainly:
1.We remain fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as defined by Dayton.
2. As for the mandate of the High Representative, we seek to place it back on its legal foundation, which is Annex 10, and prepare for the closure of the OHR’s
3. We reject unilateral decrees that rewrite the treaty, criminalize debate, persecute political opponents through a weaponized judicial system, discriminate political parties or suspend the will of voters.
A legal reset in Bosnia is a logical next step if we want to prevent escalation or successive future crises.
Therefore, I respectfully call on this Council to take some immediate steps:
1. Schedule a formal vote on Mr. Schmidt’s confirmation. If he cannot pass the vote, let us find another candidate who can and who will be appointed in accordance with annex 10.
2. Establish an independent legal review, under Security Council auspices, of the conformity of the so-called “Bonn powers” with Annex 10 and the UN Charter.
3. Encourage all BiH stakeholders to engage in a dialogue aimed at preventing further crises and revitalizing functional governance.
We are prepared to participate constructively, transparently, and in good faith.
Mr President, members of the Council,
The Dayton Agreement ended a devastating war and laid the foundation for our constitutional system. It deserves respect, not manipulation and breach of its procedures.
Let us together ensure that Bosnia’s future is written not by decree, but by law.
On a separate but critical note, I want to clarify an issue. As a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I have been forced to engage directly with your missions due to obstruction by the BiH Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This ministry selectively restricts my diplomatic correspondence while granting unrestricted access to my Bosniak colleague. This bias extends even to Bosnia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
Such actions demonstrate the reality of the state we are being asked to accept—a system where power is centralized, constitutional rights are disregarded, and even the fundamental ability to communicate is manipulated for political ends.
I thank you for your attention and remain at your disposal for any questions."
105744,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović, at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) and Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=105744&langTag=en-US,2025-04-15,"Dear Deputy Secretary General of NATO, distinguished ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Presidency of BiH, I would like to express my gratitude to NATO for its continued support to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today's meeting, at the highest level, once again demonstrates that Bosnia and Herzegovina is important to the Alliance and that it is very important to accelerate the Euro-Atlantic path of our country.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO are inextricably linked.
NATO has established and maintained peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina are eternally grateful to NATO.
The Dayton Peace Agreement, Annex 1-A, clearly stipulates the role of NATO. According to this international agreement, NATO has a mandate and a duty, when necessary, to establish its forces with the aim of protecting peace and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. No country outside the Alliance has such strong ties with NATO as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The positions of the last NATO summits in Madrid (2022), Vilnius (2023), Washington (2024) are particularly important for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of particular importance is the Alliance's approach, which implies that the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina is incorporated into the security of NATO, as well as the importance of joint action to strengthen the defence capabilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We particularly welcome NATO's decision to develop a new Defence Capacity Building (DCB) package for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The package includes projects that are very important for strengthening defence capabilities, resilience and interoperability with NATO.
The state authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina unanimously defined the legal framework and opted for the membership of our country in NATO.
Our country has adopted all key legal, strategic and other documents in the field of defence and security. This is evidenced, among other things, by the following acts:
- Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Review of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Defence Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Security Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Statements of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the commitment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to join NATO;
- Resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which clearly states that the goal is to become a member of NATO.
The Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Article 84, clearly stipulates: “The Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all defence entities, within their own constitutional and legal jurisdiction, shall carry out the necessary activities for the admission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO membership.”
If someone within Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to change the adopted laws and strategic documents, they can only try to do so in accordance with the legal procedure and in the manner in which these acts were adopted.
Until the aforementioned laws and documents are changed, they must be implemented and are binding on everyone. I remind you, they were unanimously adopted by state bodies, with the votes of Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, and Others.
On the path towards full NATO membership, Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved concrete results.
Among other things, the state authorities have:
- adopted five annual reform programs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were submitted to Brussels, and the sixth is in preparation;
- agreed with NATO on the Individual Tailored Partnership Program for the period 2025-2028;
- adopted more than 70 decisions in the field of defence at the sessions of the Presidency of BiH in the last two years;
- declared and evaluated the Light Infantry Battalion Battle Group of the Armed Forces of BiH, which was successfully assessed by NATO;
- realized an important visit of the NAC to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2024;
- successfully organized the NATO Partnership 360 Symposium 2024 as hosts;
- allocated more funds for defence in this mandate;
- adopted a new structure of the General Staff, after two years of blockade;
- appointed new generals in the Armed Forces of BiH;
- approved at the sessions of the Presidency of BiH the participation of the Armed Forces of BiH (AFBiH) in peace support missions and operations (Ethiopia and Eritrea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo, Mali, Central African Republic), thereby contributing to collective security;
- enabled the participation of members of the AFBiH in NATO structures;
- and ensured that Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time, was invited to contribute to the NATO Response Force, i.e. high-readiness forces, which are capable of rapid deployment at short notice.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the results achieved would have been better if it were not for the destructive actions of pro-Russian politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, the leadership of BiH entity of Republika Srpska (RS) brutally attacked the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the beginning of March this year. Let us not forget that the leadership of this entity has been undermining the Dayton Peace Agreement for years and is openly working against the Euro-Atlantic integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The competent judicial institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina) have, in accordance with the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted appropriate measures and decisions that have rendered the illegal acts of BiH entity of RS legally invalid.
I would like to remind you that Milorad Dodik was sentenced in the first instance to one year in prison and a six-year ban on political activity for attacking the constitutional order of the state.
Due to the denial of court decisions and the continuation of anti-constitutional actions, the Court of BiH, in accordance with the law, issued a central arrest warrant for Milorad Dodik, Nenad Stevandić and Radovan Višković.
Given these facts, the aforementioned leaders of BiH entity of RS are no longer relevant interlocutors, they are the subject of justice.
Due to the violation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and the threat to peace by the President of BiH entity of RS and his closest associates, justified sanctions were imposed by the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Austria, and the anti-Dayton policy was condemned by almost all NATO members and the entire democratic world.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO have many common interests in our country becoming a member of the Alliance as soon as possible.
Among other things, I will list the following reasons:
Bosnia and Herzegovina's NATO and EU paths are complementary. It is evident that progress on the NATO path simultaneously brings Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to the EU membership.
Security and military reasons are reflected in the fact that it would be much more efficient to integrate Bosnia and Herzegovina into NATO than to deploy NATO forces to establish peace and security in the country and the region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in NATO is the best solution in terms of ensuring a quality security environment.
NATO membership is also important for political reasons. As a NATO member, Bosnia and Herzegovina would strengthen its democratic path and development.
NATO membership would strengthen regional cooperation, as good neighbourly relations contribute to reducing security threats.
NATO membership creates the conditions for economic stability and growth of foreign investment.
As one of the members of the Presidency of BiH, I express my full commitment to dynamizing reform processes and assuming responsibility, in accordance with my competences.
This includes, among other things: consistent respect for the Constitution and laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, strengthening the efficiency of state institutions, respecting decisions of judicial institutions, more efficient implementation of BiH Reform Program, and increasing defence spending.
Finally, I have a few concrete suggestions.
I believe that it is extremely important for NATO to act proactively in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including through deterrence.
It is very important to ensure the long-term presence of NATO forces in military bases in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This would be the best prevention of the disruption of peace and security in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
In the event that the UN Security Council vetoes the extension of the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is essential to have a ready NATO response, in accordance with Annex 1-A of the Dayton Peace Agreement. A security vacuum in Bosnia and Herzegovina could have catastrophic consequences.
Bosnia and Herzegovina should be even more firmly institutionally incorporated into the Alliance's security framework. This includes an increased NATO presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the adoption of a strategic concept that strengthens security guarantees for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the development of concrete plans for political and military action in crisis situations.
I propose the adoption of a joint action plan, with the aim of inviting Bosnia and Herzegovina to NATO membership as soon as possible.
Finally, I propose that such a meeting, in the format of NAC and Bosnia and Herzegovina, be held at least once a year.
Thank you for your attention."
105736,Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić addressed the members of the North Atlantic Council,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=105736&langTag=en-US,2025-04-15,"During his address to the NAC members, BiH Presidency member Željko Komšić presented his view of the current political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an emphasis on Bosnia and Herzegovina's path towards full membership in NATO.
“Esteemed members of the North Atlantic Council,
It is my pleasure and honour to address you briefly and present my view of the current political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an emphasis on my country’s path towards full membership in NATO.
In a few sentences, allow me to briefly recall that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s path towards NATO membership began in 2001, with the adoption of the relevant Declaration in the Parliamentary Assembly, which resulted in the Law on the Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prescribed the obligation of all state institutions to work towards fulfilling the criteria for NATO membership.
We submitted our official request for participation in the MAP (Membership Action Plan) back in 2009, and in 2018 the NAC invited Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in the MAP.
In 2019, we only drafted and submitted the first Annual National Program (ANP), which we renamed the Reform Program in agreement with the allies, and four Reform Programs were submitted in the previous period, and the fifth is expected to be submitted very soon.
What we can jointly assess is that all Reform Programs after 2019 are, in fact, the same versions of the one from 2019, and I expect that this will be clearly stated and concrete tasks set for Bosnia and Herzegovina from each subsequent NATO evaluation.
In addition, Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated in two NATO missions, in Afghanistan and Iraq, then several United Nations missions, and finally a series of military exercises with NATO forces at home and abroad, where the interoperability of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was rated very highly.
On the other hand, the current political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, initiated by the first-instance verdict against Milorad Dodik, the President of Republika Srpska entity, is very complex and may pose a direct threat to the security of the country and the entire region.
We have a judicial procedure on the one hand, conducted by domestic judicial institutions, which on the other hand is attempted to be turned into a political issue and some kind of internal dialogue, although in its essence it is not because it is not a political issue but, above all, a security issue.
We even have such signals that an attempt is being made to negotiate and agree on a solution through internal dialogue, which is actually impossible, because there is no political agreement or treaty that can or should devalue the decisions of judicial bodies, because that would be the final blow to the rule of law in our country.
We are fully aware that this is a matter for the domestic judicial and police institutions, which must resolve it themselves and which can be assisted by the EUFOR forces, and even NATO, as equal legal successors of the former SFOR, as already decided in Resolution 1575 of the United Nations Security Council from 2004.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you how quickly SFOR forces reacted in 2001 in the ""Hercegovacka Banka"" case and prevented the then-attack on the constitutional order that was taking place under the name of ""Hrvatska samouprava"" (""Croatian self-government"").
In a short conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina allocates 0.95% of its GDP for defence, which is insufficient and, unfortunately, limited by the existence of the Fiscal Framework, which limits the state budget to 500 million euros, although in reality it should be around 15 billion euros.
If we were to abolish the existence of the Fiscal Framework, then we would have enough funds to fulfil our obligation under the NATO criteria to allocate 2% of GDP for defence.
Because of all the above, I call on NATO allies to pay additional attention to fulfilling the political criteria, especially those related to the rule of law and democracy, in the upcoming period regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in the MAP and its 5 chapters.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rule of law is currently being attacked by those political actors who use the current poor political system to achieve a series of blockades, thereby attacking democracy itself and the democratic processes in the country.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a positive sentiment among around 70% of citizens who want NATO membership, which can be politically blocked by only one member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or only 3 delegates in the legislative body of government called the House of Peoples.
It is therefore essential that our NATO allies focus their attention, in addition to military criteria, on political criteria, in order to unblock the processes that lead Bosnia and Herzegovina towards NATO membership, as well as a country where the rule of law and full democracy prevail.
Thank you for your attention. """
105264,Speech by Serb member and Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović at the Global Baku Forum,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=105264&langTag=en-US,2025-03-13,"There is a large number of crisis areas and negative developments in the world, so it is logical to ask whether these challenges can be turned into opportunities.
I come from a country that, unfortunately, is going through the biggest political and constitutional crisis in its thirty-year history.
I must admit that I have a very bad feeling about the possible outcome of the thoughtless decision of an unelected foreigner, confirmed by instrumentalized judicial institutions.
Generally speaking, everyone is now waiting to see what international relations will look like after the arrival of the new administration, led by President Trump.
The American deep state, together with globalist and bureaucratic elites in Europe, is using Bosnia and Herzegovina as an experiment for radical nation-building with the aim of creating a centralized state, completely different from the one envisaged and established by the Dayton Agreement – ​​with a decentralized structure.
The fact is that this experiment, after three decades, has resulted in a failed state and has failed to impose a common national identity that would turn Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks into one nation.
Their main tool is the instrumentalized judicial institutions, where, in the case of the Constitutional Court of BiH, three foreign judges are actually helping to change the Dayton Peace Agreement and our constitution in order to illegally create a unitary state.
In practice, the Constitutional Court of BiH is used to change the Constitution, instead of protecting it. Another example of abuse of judicial institutions is the Court of BiH, which, incidentally, was not provided for in the Dayton Agreement at all, and before which a political trial ended ingloriously with a verdict that could plunge BiH into a vortex of violence and disintegration.
The legally and democratically elected President of Republika Srpska was convicted for fulfilling his constitutional obligation and signing laws passed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska; the verdict in the first instance is – one year in prison and a ban on candidacy for the office of President or any other political office for a period of six years.
All this happened because an unelected foreigner, who falsely claims to be the High Representative – a German pretender to absolute power – in contradiction to international law, the Dayton Agreement, the Constitution of BiH and the Constitution of Republika Srpska, imposed amendments to the Criminal Code, according to which disrespect for his illegitimate and autocratic decisions is a criminal offense.
This trial is a classic example of violence by legal means – where the judicial system is used as a tool to eliminate political dissenters under the guise of administering justice. This is a deliberate attempt to weaken a democratically elected leader for protecting the sovereignty of his people and traditional values.
This abuse of the judiciary forces the legal and legitimate institutions and elected representatives of Republika Srpska to wage an existential struggle to preserve the Dayton Agreement and the constitutional autonomy and powers guaranteed to our Republika and our people.
In all likelihood, the response of this uncrowned ruler from Germany and the instrumentalized judiciary will be additional repression, threats of violence, retaliation, and further abuse of the judiciary for political purposes.
I believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina must move away from these politically motivated moves and turn to building a truly democratic system, in which elected leaders will have the power to make decisions, where the judiciary will not be a tool of political war, and the law will serve the people, not the interests of a few unelected officials who are not accountable to anyone, but still impose their will."
105125,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović, on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=105125&langTag=en-US,2025-02-27,"Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina at home and abroad, distinguished excellencies, eminences, distinguished guests! I would like to extend a special greeting to the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Schmidt, the Head of the EU Delegation, Mr Soreca, as well as numerous ambassadors and international representatives. Their arrival tonight is an important message.
Today, with pride and dignity, we celebrate our great holiday - the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This holiday symbolizes freedom, unity and the right of citizens to express their democratic will. The results of the legal and democratic referendum for an independent, sovereign and united Bosnia and Herzegovina were recognized by the entire world, and on May 22, 1992, our country became a full member of the United Nations. This is an epochal result, which cannot be erased.
The vast majority of the citizens of our country decided to preserve the thousand-year-old past on March 1st and open the door to the future for our country. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not allow the history of our country to be trampled and the future to be in division and occupation.
The democratically expressed will of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina was defended by brave and honorable patriots during the brutal aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe them boundless respect and gratitude.
Millions of people who love Bosnia and Herzegovina, both at home and abroad, follow the noblest idea - the idea of ​​freedom. It is the strongest idea that man has ever had and will have, as long as human society exists.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a long-lived and resistant state.
The centuries behind us undoubtedly confirm this. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a permanent international legal, historical and political fact. No one can dispute that.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a coherent whole for centuries.
Prominent American historians Robert Donia and John Fine rightly stated: Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a unique entity for centuries. Our country is a centuries-old plural society that proves that pluralism can successfully exist. Bosnia and Herzegovina has built a special cultural and spiritual value.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we live in a brutal world.
The world we knew until February 2022 was not fair, but this new one that is being born is much more unfair and cruel. We need to be careful.
We must face the truth: There are destructive individuals who, out of personal interest, threaten the collective interest of Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and other citizens to live in peace and a secure environment.
In order to realize this dark plan, they are trying to devastate the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The attacks on the institutions of the High Representative and the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina are not accidental. This is part of a dangerous plan to destroy the constitutional order and institutions that have the mandate and authority to stop anti-Dayton and anti-constitutional activities.
How to respond to challenges and temptations?
Let us not forget that, based on the provisions of the UN Charter and the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States, in accordance with the 1970 United Nations Charter, the right to self-defence is a fundamental right of every state. This right is an inseparable part of its sovereignty.
The state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina are obliged to activate all available resources when necessary, for the purpose of protecting the state and all its citizens and peoples.
On the foreign policy front, let us continue to diligently and daily develop and strengthen our strategic alliances. Let us work in an organized and united manner.
On the domestic political front, we must be much more cautious and prepared. We all have an obligation to preserve constitutionality, legality and fight for the human rights of all citizens and peoples. This is our common interest.
We face great trials and challenges. The competent state institutions, as well as the responsible representatives and military forces of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have a clear mandate, duty and mechanisms to stop and sanction all those who threaten peace, stability and constitutional order.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Any attempt to destroy the constitutional order of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is an act of endangering peace.
All those who try to endanger the Dayton Peace Agreement will be responsible for opening Pandora's box and for consequences that could be unforeseeable. My message to all people in our country is that we should not allow a collective catastrophe to be caused by protecting the interests of privileged individuals.
I publicly call on all political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to act responsibly.
In defending peace, people and the state, no one should be calculating. We must resolutely and together safeguard the principles of constitutionality and legality, with all available state mechanisms and means.
Let us together and resolutely stop the targeted spread of apathy, defeatism and any possible incidents.
Ladies and gentlemen!
In these complex moments for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would like to address each and every person in our country in particular.
I would like to address Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and all other citizens.
Together, let us preserve peace, stability and the constitutional order that guarantees it.
Together, let us not allow the tragedy of the 1990s to repeat itself.
Together, let us not allow irresponsible politicians to lead us into a collective tragedy.
Together, let us prevent any incident that will be a cover for the forces of darkness to destabilize the situation.
Let's take care of our children together, Bosniak, Serb, Croat and every other child.
Let the 33rd anniversary of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina be an additional motivation for us to continue building our country for all its inhabitants.
Long live our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina!
She always had sons and daughters to defend her.
That's how it has been and that's how it will stay.
This year, we celebrate our national holiday on the eve of the beginning of the month of Ramadan. On this occasion, I congratulate Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region and around the world on the coming month of Ramadan.
And finally, to all citizens I proudly wish happy March 1 - Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
105121,Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=105121&langTag=en-US,2025-02-27,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the end of the last century, faced with the new political reality that arose after the collapse of communism and the reality of the disintegration of the former common state, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through their political representatives elected in the first democratic elections, on March 1, 1992, set out on the then only possible path, the path of voting for the independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the path of independence and sovereignty.
Historical circumstances and the age-old desire for independence came together in a successfully held referendum on independence that laid the foundation for the international recognition of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A recognition that had to be defended with weapons since our neighbours turned into aggressors who were not ready to accept the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a political and international fact.
International recognition was preceded by our, let's call it that, our own civic self-recognition, or the acquired awareness that in the fight for the independence of our state we can and must rely primarily on ourselves and our own forces.
This awareness in practical terms was manifested immediately at the beginning of the aggression when the available republican institutions, and most of all the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, reacted decisively to the moves of the secessionists and aggressors in the defence of vital state institutions and in the protection of the lives of citizens.
The further development of events and the course of the aggression gave the right to such a belief. Our own forces concentrated in and around the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, under the supreme command the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, remained our only support in the fight for independence.
Not only could we not rely on international forces, but the international factor was most often on the side of the aggressor, which was seen through the offered peace plans that did not presuppose Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state, but sometimes as a union of states, sometimes as a confederation, sometimes as anything else but never as a unified state.
Such an attitude of the international factor towards Bosnia and Herzegovina lasted until we formed, organized and structured the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into a military force capable of carrying out the most complex military operations and achieving both tactical and strategic victories.
Only after that, when it became clear that Bosnia and Herzegovina would not disappear, and when it became clear that the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was an invincible factor, only after that could we count on some form of assistance from international forces.
But, let's not lie to ourselves, that assistance was not the result of their international will or favour, but the result of our demonstrated strength in the fight for our homeland.
All this points us to a conclusion based on great collective experience, which says that whenever we have relied on our own strength, the result of our struggle has been visible and concrete, and whenever we have, sometimes in numerous illusions, relied on another in the defence of our lives and homeland, the result has been devastating.
And that is why today there must be no dilemma about who we can rely on in the upcoming challenges.
We must rely on ourselves, but also talk to everyone from both the East and the West. Let us talk and cooperate with everyone if it will be beneficial to the homeland.
Let us reject all those frequent and malicious objections to our attempts to cooperate or establish contacts with countries that are undoubtedly friendly to our homeland.
We are not obliged to justify and explain ourselves to anyone. We owe that only to our country and our children, and the only guarantee of our independence are our duties towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Every day we witness again and again that the world that existed yesterday, the relations that until yesterday were the foundations of such and such an international order no longer exist.
If we do not change to such an extent, and if there is still in us the same thread that united us in the defence of the homeland thirty years ago, today we must be equally aware that global circumstances are changing, just as they were changing at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The echo of these global changes can be felt here in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Therefore, we are welcoming this Independence Day with an ever smaller political presence of a foreign factor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It must be said loud and clear that the international community and its role in BiH, as a concrete and effective mechanism, no longer exists.
Let's throw it out of our political, academic and every other vocabulary, so that at least at the level of language and thought we can catch the last train with contemporary events.
The reality that follows will be completely different from this post-Dayton era that we have survived.
If we want to catch that last train of reality, we will have to simultaneously find the strength and our own capacities to defend the integrity of the decisions of domestic institutions, both when we like those decisions and when we don't like them.
We will have to ensure the functioning of the state, systems and institutions, as we know and can.
Therefore, when I speak of relying on one's own strength and capacities, I do not mean merely taking up arms in an absent moment, but rather taking responsibility for one's own country.
The time has passed when, due to the malfunctioning of this or that institution, one turned to a foreign ambassador. Until now, seeking such a nanny was ridiculous, but from now on it could be disastrous.
However, we in Bosnia and Herzegovina are no exception.
The whole of Europe is currently trying to consolidate itself, precisely for similar reasons.
We are not the only ones who must now primarily rely on our own strength.
The whole of Europe is facing this challenge, and if it wants its own freedom, it will have to pay dearly for it or fight for it, since the great tutor has cancelled unconditional support.
Therefore, our and European challenges are almost the same, and if there is still something called the European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is precisely in the imperative that both Europe and Bosnia and Herzegovina must deal with themselves.
In this sense, we should be clear that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europe, whatever we mean when we say Europe, share the same future, not to say fatalistically, destiny.
That should be our most important foreign policy landmark in the future.
In this, after all, I see an opportunity for the healing of both Europe and Bosnia and Herzegovina and the social relations that prevail in it.
Whatever challenges await us, and it is clear that they will not be easy, I am sure that Bosnia and Herzegovina will overcome them because we passed our most difficult tests of state self-affirmation long ago, and showed the world who we are and what we are.
This country has a reason for its existence and survival.
It is a natural and social entity and not any ideological or political construct imposed by anyone.
That whole, in itself, is characteristically and mentally specific, indivisible and indestructible, like the love of the Bosnian man for his homeland, which has lasted for centuries and will last as long as there are us.
Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Happy Independence Day!"
104822,"Address by the Serb member and Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović at the World Summit of Governments in Dubai at the forum ""Innovative governance for a resilient futur",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=104822&langTag=en-US,2025-02-11,"Dear Excellencies, Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me that for the first time I have the opportunity to participate in this prestigious summit and to speak about a topic that is of fundamental importance for the future of all of us.
At the very beginning, I want to thank the hosts for the invitation and congratulate them on the excellent organization of this very important event.
In a time of unpredictable global processes and tectonic geopolitical upheavals, we face serious challenges that call into question the resilience of our institutions, economies and societies.
In such circumstances, responsible, efficient and innovative management becomes not only imperative, but also a basic prerequisite for preserving stability, sustainable growth and development, as well as the progress of society as a whole.
The resilience of any community depends to the greatest extent on the strength of its institutions, which implies their ability to successfully meet the various needs of citizens.
In the era of the digital revolution, which has fundamentally transformed the way we live, communicate and do business, there is no effective management without the application of new, modern technologies.
Galloping technological changes are setting new standards for public administration, giving it the opportunity to become more agile, transparent and closer to citizens than ever in the past through the process of digitization.
From e-government to artificial intelligence, digital tools already represent indispensable segments of every modern administration, and their role will be even more significant and pronounced in the future.
Countries which recognize the importance of technological innovation in this area have made significant progress in terms of raising the quality of public services.
A great example of this is the host country of this summit - the United Arab Emirates, whose programs to improve the efficiency of the administration through the digitalization process show really impressive results.
We are very interested in strengthening cooperation with the UAE in this sector, as well as in the application of modern digital solutions, with the aim of improving the quality of public services, preserving public order and peace, and raising the level of security of our citizens and property.
There is no doubt that there is a clear correlation between the adoption of innovative approaches and technological modernization on the one hand, and faster and more sustainable economic growth on the other.
In the 21st century, it is almost impossible to build a competitive economy without digital transformation in administration and economy and without strategic investments in education and scientific research.
That is why different levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina are implementing numerous reforms, with the aim of strengthening competitiveness through the process of modernizing the economy and introducing innovations in areas such as education and public administration.
However, we are aware that it is a continuous and extremely demanding process in which we must constantly catch up with very dynamic contemporary trends.
The key players in the digital transformation of our society are young people who successfully use the most advanced digital tools in their daily lives, education and work, just like their peers in the most developed countries of the world.
We must pay extra attention to young people, their education and training and offer them appropriate conditions, so that they can use their modern technological knowledge and skills for the development and progress of the entire society.
The world we live in is becoming more and more connected, and the challenges we face have long gone beyond the borders between countries and peoples.
Economic crises, migration, various security challenges require joint efforts and collective responses from us, because none of us can overcome them individually.
That is why the improvement of cooperation is imperative, both at the bilateral and regional, as well as at the global level.
I am sure that the future belongs to those who are ready to build bridges of fruitful cooperation, constructive dialogue, mutual understanding and sincere partnership on equal grounds with others.
I am strongly in favour of strengthening regional cooperation within the Western Balkans, because it is the best way to build a more stable and prosperous environment for all of us in the region.
Joint economic initiatives, energy and infrastructure projects can bring enormous benefits to all of us and significantly accelerate the economic development of both the region as a whole and all individual countries.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am convinced that we can learn a lot from each other in different areas, including the ones we discussed today.
That is why I see gatherings like this prestigious summit as very important and precious in the context of mutual exchange of knowledge, contacts, information and experiences.
Some claim that the world has changed more in the last 40 years than it has in the previous thousand years. At first it seems unreal, but not unfounded.
What is certain is that the world we live in today is drastically different from the one just a decade ago, and that in ten years this world will seem like a distant past.
This means only one thing - that we have to keep up with the times, to strengthen institutions and modernize management, to invest in education and innovation, to improve cooperation and partnerships, in order to preserve stability, ensure sustainable growth and development and be able to cope with all upcoming challenges.
The coming future is not entirely predictable, just like the challenges that will be in front of us in the coming period, but I believe that we will have at our disposal enough modern tools to overcome them, as well as the knowledge to use them in the best possible way.
Thank you for your attention."
104544,"Address by the Serb member and Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željka Cvijanović, at the traditional Christmas reception",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=104544&langTag=en-US,2025-01-16,"Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, Peace of God, Christ is born!
With this traditional greeting, Orthodox Christians convey to one another, and to the entire world, the most joyous message in the history of humankind.
In the language of modern media, the headline of this news might read: 'The Son of God descended among humanity and became one of us'.
The light of this magnificent and unparalleled event continues to illuminate our hearts and homes to this day, just as the bright star illuminated the Bethlehem cave at the moment of Christ's birth.
In honor and celebration of the Christ Child and His arrival in the world, we observe Christmas as a holiday of true joy - a joy that grows only greater when shared.
That is why, as in previous years, I am immensely happy and deeply grateful to all of you for gathering here today for this wonderful occasion.
During this festive season, I would like us to reflect on the values that are universal and shared by all of us, regardless of faith, nationality, or skin color.
Our traditional Christmas greeting, with which I began this address, starts with the word 'peace'.
Peace, like love, is one of the fundamental universal values inherent in various cultures and religions.
As human beings, we are all called to live in peace with one another, and an essential prerequisite for peace is mutual respect and understanding.
The diversity within Bosnia and Herzegovina underscores the necessity for greater tolerance, helping to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts.
While it is natural to love and preserve our own heritage, we must equally respect and value the heritage of others.
We should nurture our identity, uphold our traditions, and celebrate our holidays, but never deny others the right to do the same.
Through dialogue and open communication, we must address and resolve any outstanding issues, without expecting someone else to wave a magic wand and impose a solution at the expense of any one party.
I deeply believe that any agreement reached domestically, no matter how imperfect or time-consuming, is far better than any solution imposed externally.
Everything foreign and forcibly imposed in this region has historically had a limited lifespan.
In contrast, the only sustainable solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in an agreement reached by its constituent peoples - through compromise, their own will, and their own wisdom.
Dear friends, distinguished guests,
Thank you for honoring this event, which is especially dear and important to me, with your presence.
I wish you, above all, good health, joy, and happiness in your homes, as well as success in your personal and professional endeavors.
To all of us, I wish serenity and peace within ourselves, and naturally, with one another.
With these sincere wishes, I once again warmly greet you with our most beautiful Christmas greeting: Peace of God, Christ is born!
Thank you."
104425,"Speech by the Serb member and Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željka Cvijanović, at the ceremony on the occasion of the Day of Republika Srpska",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=104425&langTag=en-US,2025-01-08,"Your Holiness and Your Eminences, Esteemed President of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, Esteemed President of the Government of the Republic of Serbia and President of the Government of Republika Srpska, Esteemed Deputies and Delegates of Srpska and Serbia, Ministers in the Governments of Serbia and Republika Srpska and in the Council of Ministers, Dear Chief of the General Staff of the Army of Serbia, Esteemed members of the Senate, Esteemed officers, soldiers, fighters and representatives of associations and organizations stemming from the Defence-Fatherland War, Your Excellencies, ambassadors and representatives of the diplomatic corps,
Dear guests,
Dear citizens of Republika Srpska,
May there be peace in the year that we will walk through together for the next 12 months.
I wish that the strength of the family protects us in this and all the years to come, that the strength of institutions protects us, and that this year also strengthens our faith in a better future.
Today, the entire Republika Srpska is celebrating in the colours of our most beautiful tri-colour in honour of its birthday, in the spirit of freedom, love, the desire for progress and all those values ​​that every community and every individual naturally aspires to.
Celebrating Christmas gives a special dimension to every other holiday, and I sincerely hope that the warmth of Christmas will shine on every family and everyone who celebrates it.
Equally, I hope that words of friendship and solidarity will touch every neighbour or fellow citizen who celebrates other holidays and gathers their family on other dates.
As every year, Republika Srpska celebrates its holidays with solemnity and dignity.
From the hills and mountains of unconquerable Herzegovina, through freedom-loving Romanija and heroic Krajina, the beautiful banks and canyons of the Drina, all the way to the fertile plains of Semberija, Lijevče and Posavina.
It is easy to understand why the Day of Republika is one of the most important holidays in the national calendar of the Serb people.
Because it's the day we chose survival, instead of the extinction that others intended for us.
It is the day when we clearly announced that we will proudly walk the path of freedom, and never again bow our heads on the road of no return, in the columns of death.
On that day, we chose unity over division, harmony over strife, union over partition.
And that is exactly why it was and remains so important to us, and for some others, subsequently, in the process of political reckoning with everything that belongs to someone else, it became a subject of dispute, although previously, together with us, they marked it for years.
Dear citizens, esteemed guests,
Usually during the holidays, with the desire to build a better and more certain future, we also look back at the world in which we live and the environment in which we fulfil our role as a society.
We live in an area that has experienced many historical adversities, but still, as a community or a people, we have not succumbed to merciless historical processes, although almost none of them have bypassed or spared us.
We can rightly say that Republika Srpska has been exposed to pressures throughout its entire development.
From the time of its creation to the time when it defended its freedom and even today, when it defends its constitutional capacity.
And although no period has been easy, we owe the greatest gratitude to those without whose selfless sacrifice today we would have nothing to protect or anything to fight for.
To those who left their lives, body parts and health, defending their families and friends, houses and fields, churches and graves.
And therefore we owe the greatest respect and special gratitude to the soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska, members of the police of Republika Srpska and the families of the fallen and missing soldiers.
Because of their sacrifice, Republika Srpska is also a covenant community and that is why today none of us has the right to trade with it, regardless of all pressures, sanctions, blackmail and threats.
Our forests, rivers and meadows are soaked with the blood of the best sons of Republika Srpska and the tears of their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, wives and orphans.
Such a thing is not handed over to someone else, nor is it handed over to oblivion.
Republika Srpska is a stable society today, it functions as a successful political community, financially sustainable and capable of dealing with all problems.
We are grateful to the institutions of Srpska that have remained strong and that have brought us through many politically and economically difficult times with far fewer scars than would otherwise have been the case if we had allowed them to be weakened by various external or internal shocks.
It is enough to recall that several hundred million marks that have belonged to Republika Srpska for years, and out of pure political whim, have been sitting unallocated in various accounts in BiH, which could have served the additional development of Republika.
This is hard to understand for anyone in any other country, but in BiH everything that is abnormal anywhere in the developed, democratic world has become the standard.
Thus, in BiH it has become the standard that the Constitutional Court does not protect its own constitution, but rather creates new unconstitutional solutions.
That it is served by foreign judges instead of domestic judges, and that judges continue their professional engagement even after the prescribed retirement age.
It has become the standard for unelected foreign individuals to impose new and change existing laws instead of having them passed by parliament in a democratic procedure, and for ambassadors to address members of parliament via video link, dictating to them how to vote.
However, the height of political absurdity and democratic collapse is that, with the use of foreign force, respect for domestic constitutions and laws is incriminated, and the judiciary is consequently used for a political showdown with the elected president of Republika Srpska, with the absurd accusation that, in carrying out his constitutional obligation, he violated the decision of Christian Schmidt.
The fate of BiH and its health will depend solely on the extent and duration of such deviations in its institutional life.
The sooner BiH emerges from the vortex of legal uncertainty, voluntarism, interventionism, and the usurpation of domestic institutions by foreign individuals, the greater the chances it has of embarking on the path of healing.
Dear guests, dear citizens,
I also feel the need to say how important it is that hatred and intolerance should never be the driving force behind any activity or reaction in Republika Srpska, but that awareness of other people's hatred should always be a call for increased caution.
I would like to stress in particular that it is extremely important that Republika preserves its democratic capacity and that every resident, regardless of religion or nationality, feels safe and protected in it, treated equally and without barriers in exercising their rights.
It should also be said that, despite the combined destructive actions of individuals from political Sarajevo and foreign circles, Republika Srpska today has more friends in the world than it has ever had in the past.
There are, therefore, foreign addresses, both in the West and in the East, where our friends or our partners or our good acquaintances who understand the position of Republika Srpska live.
Who understand that the picture in BiH is not black and white and that the only things that are healing for BiH are domestic dialogue, the engagement of domestic institutions and an environment in which every nation feels comfortable and protected, and every individual is treated in the same way.
Of particular importance for Republika Srpska is the cooperation we have with Serbia, to which, led by President Aleksandar Vučić, we owe immense gratitude for constant care, attention and support.
When it comes to the EU, it should also be recalled that our representatives at various levels of government have made a significant contribution to the implementation of several important reforms on the European path, but it should also be said that the movement towards the EU has been burdened, and often stopped, by numerous crises that have arisen as a result of the OHR interventions.
This process will become credible only when it is implemented in accordance with the basic postulates of the EU and when it is based on the activities of democratically elected domestic institutions, as is already the case with all EU member states and those aspiring to join it.
Republika Srpska remains open and committed to cooperation with all, based on mutual respect and understanding.
We are aware that the world is currently in great and dangerous disorder, and it is important for us to preserve peace and stability, and in this historical vortex, to preserve primarily ourselves, Republika Srpska, as well as its constitutional position.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear citizens of Republika Srpska,
As someone who has had the honour of performing many important duties on its behalf for almost a decade and a half, I am unspeakably proud of our Republika.
In that period, as before, many winds have been breaking Republika Srpska, but none brought it to its knees, thanks to its strong immunity woven from the love and will of our people.
It remained, survived and emerged from every natural, economic or political disaster, perhaps not always stronger, but certainly wiser and more experienced.
That is why even today I firmly believe that no challenge is so great and insurmountable when we are united and gathered around Republika Srpska and its vital interests.
That this is indeed so is perhaps best evidenced by this holiday and the day when Republika Srpska was born for eternity.
Dear citizens, distinguished guests, it is my honour to once again, on behalf of the President of Republika Srpska, Mr Milorad Dodik, with holiday greetings, wish you a peaceful, stable and serene Republika Srpska, and to you and your loved ones all the best on a personal and professional level.
Peace of God, the Christ is born!
Long live Republika Srpska!
Long live Serbia!"
104189,"Speech by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović, at the ""Athlete of the Year"" event, organized by the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=104189&langTag=en-US,2024-12-18,"Dear President of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Rađo, respected Vice-Presidents and members of the Executive Committee of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected representatives of the executive and legislative authorities at all levels, dear athletes, sports workers, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have gathered at this important sports event to pay tribute to exceptional individuals who, with their effort, talent, dedication and results, inspire and encourage the entire society.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich sports tradition.
The Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo left an indelible mark in the hearts of our people and became an important part of the sports and cultural identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This event also inspires new generations, positively promoting our capital and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the world stage.
Our strategic interest is to bring back the former sports spirit and to become a sports-oriented nation again, in full capacity.
As the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Paris this year, I supported the Olympic team of Bosnia and Herzegovina represented by Lana Pudar, Aleksandra Samardžić, Larisa Cerić, Mesud Pezer and Jovan Lekić.
In the building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after the end of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, I organized receptions for the Olympic and Paralympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I am glad that I was able to help our athletes in a concrete way, within the available funds.
It is time for the entire country to understand the importance of sports.
In the modern world, sport and sports diplomacy are among the key factors in the redistribution of political and economic power.
Modern sport, due to its popularity and media ubiquity, has become an instrument through which countries attract investments, thus strengthening their international reputation and influence.
We should be aware that in recent decades, in addition to classical diplomacy, sports, cultural, economic and other types of diplomacy have played an increasingly important role.
In the context of the above changes, we in Bosnia and Herzegovina should also recognize the positive effects of sport and sports diplomacy on creating a positive image of our country.
I would like to express special recognition to the athletes for their contribution to strengthening the atmosphere of trust and rapprochement.
The past testifies that sport has often played a positive role in spreading tolerance, peace, understanding and friendship between different peoples.
Sport is a universal phenomenon that transcends national, ethnic, religious and other borders.
Dear friends,
It is extremely important that we also develop inclusive sports programs.
Let us enable people with disabilities, as well as people from minority and marginalized groups, to actively participate, develop their talents and feel a sense of belonging to the community.
There are no impossible goals in sports.
Our swimmer Ismail Barlov is the best example of this. He brought the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina its first Olympic medal in its history, in the individual competition. Our brave boy, our Ismail, pushed the boundaries of what is possible, he is a true sports hero and the pride of our country.
I also express great respect to our sitting volleyball players, who have been winning Olympic and other medals for decades. They represent Bosnia and Herzegovina with honour and dignity.
We should all be proud of our sports heroine Lana Pudar. Thank you for her enormous effort and sacrifice, as well as for all the medals.
I also express my gratitude to all Olympians who represented Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris. They met the Olympic standards and represented our homeland with dignity among 206 countries.
Our men's senior national team in basketball brought tears of joy to our people with their recent victory over Croatia in Skenderija. Our basketball players leave their hearts on the court in every game and show everyone how to fight under the flag of their homeland.
Due to limited time, I have only highlighted a few successful individuals and teams, although there are many more athletes who deserve respect. You will be awarding some of them tonight. I congratulate them all on their successes and achievements.
These are our sports heroes, whom the entire society can look up to.
Dear friends,
we can all be proud of our athletes.
They give strength and positive energy to the entire country.
Please give them a big round of applause.
One of the universal moral authorities and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela said, ""Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. ""
In the wake of these words, let's awaken hope wherever we can.
Regardless of all the challenges, we do not lose hope.
Our sportsmen and women give hope and inspiration to all of us.
Let's be proud of them.
Let's support them.
Let's develop optimism together.
Let's invest more in sports and young people.
Let's testify with our actions that we can do better.
And let's not forget: Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country of the future."
103962,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović, at the ceremony marking the 19th anniversary and the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103962&langTag=en-US,2024-11-28,"Ladies and gentlemen,
let us not forget to express our gratitude to our friends from NATO.
Therefore, I express special respect and gratitude to NATO member states that are concretely helping to equip and strengthen the unified Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I would also like to point out the important role of the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, as well as the contribution of the EUFOR in maintaining a safe and stable environment in our country.
As a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would especially like to emphasize that the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have demonstrated:
- enormous motivation, commitment and patriotism;
- superior professionalism;
- an enviable level of readiness and dedication in saving human lives;
- the ability to work together and coordinate with the armed forces of NATO countries;
- readiness to meet NATO standards;
- and increased interoperability, as one of the most important parameters of cooperation and achieving NATO standards.
These are not just my personal assessments, these were also recognized by the highest officials of NATO. During a series of talks, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, with the Secretary General of NATO, the President of the NATO Military Committee and other top officials of this alliance, I witnessed how respected our Armed Forces are.
The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina must remain above and beyond political and individual aspirations. They must remain a positive example, which other institutions should emulate.
The military must remain professional, responsible and in the function of realizing its legally defined mission.
Our Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have shown that they serve the citizens.
Despite limited resources, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven to be a reliable institution that assists citizens and civilian structures in responding to natural disasters and other emergencies.
The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has acted responsibly and in a timely manner in situations of natural and other disasters, has unanimously adopted the necessary decisions on the engagement of our military forces.
Based on more than thirty decisions of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this year alone, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven through dedicated and courageous action that they are ready and capable of providing assistance to all endangered local communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have successfully completed all their tasks. I congratulate you on that. Your professionalism, courage and dedication deserve the highest praise.
Together, we can all be proud of the multi-ethnic Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which belong to and truly serve all citizens throughout the state territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In addition to the country, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven their professionalism beyond the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They have made an immeasurable contribution to the affirmation of our state on the international stage.
In less than three decades, Bosnia and Herzegovina has transformed from a recipient to a provider of international military assistance. The credit for this primarily belongs to the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. History after World War II does not remember such rapid progress of a single state.
The ten-year successful participation of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina in international peace support operations around the world is the best confirmation that our country can be a reliable partner and contribute to world peace and security. High marks on NATO-led operations, the UN and EU missions are the best confirmation of the high level of training and professionalism of our Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our soldiers have shown how to protect the image of a country and gain the trust of allies.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We must never take our eyes off our future.
Let us continue to achieve NATO standards because they are the guarantee that together we will all have more security, economic progress and justice.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not need threats.
We must all finally understand that in our state we share both good and evil.
Let us strengthen peace, security and good neighbourly relations.
Let us work for more good and progress.
For all of us together.
Let us contribute together to make the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina even stronger and more efficient.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we live in a dangerous and cruel world.
Let the suffering of civilians in Ukraine, Gaza and other parts of the world be an additional reminder of how important it is to uphold the principles of constitutionalism and legality, because they are the fundamental prerequisites for peace and stability.
At the end of my address, I have a message for all citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina:
We cannot change the fate of our ancestors, but we can influence the fate of our descendants.
Let us work together so that our children and grandchildren have a peaceful, secure and stable future.
Let us protect together the Bosniak, Serbian, Croat and all other children in our homeland.
Let us strengthen the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the main factor in protecting peace and stability.
Dear officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers,
your mission is not only military, it is moral and social, and all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be proud of you.
Thank you for being who you are - brave, loyal, professional and honest.
Thank you for serving Bosnia and Herzegovina and all its people.
Happy the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina Day!"
103956,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić at the ceremony marking the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 19 years since their establishment, at the",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103956&langTag=en-US,2024-11-28,"“Dear soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers and civilians serving in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina…
I express my pleasure that, on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the Supreme Commander, and on my own behalf, I can address you on the occasion of the 19th Anniversary of the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The formation of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was a very complex task, requiring patience, compromise, determination, knowledge and will, so even today, 19 years after its establishment, we can say that the establishment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the best example of successful reform in our country. It is important to emphasize that this was our domestic agreement, with the assistance and help of friends from the international community, and that December 1 was not imposed by representatives of the international community.
I would like to remind you once again that the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the session of the House of Representatives held on 28 September 2005 and the session of the House of Peoples held on 5 October 2005, adopted the Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with only one vote against. These laws regulate that the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina assumes command and control over the Armed Forces.
Today, 19 years later, we can say that our armed forces represent a factor of stability and security throughout the country. They are a reliable partner, first and foremost, to all citizens of our homeland, which you recently proved in the disaster management in Konjic, Jablanica, Kreševo, Fojnica, Kiseljak, Buturović-polje. When everyone left those areas, the Armed Forces remained in certain locations where it was necessary.
You also confirm the credibility and importance of the Armed Forces in international missions, where you have repeatedly proven yourself as a reliable partner to our allies on the international level, which I have personally witnessed.
And during this year, by participating in international exercises, you have proven the tradition of successful cooperation with soldiers from NATO countries, according to NATO standards. Unfortunately, in the current year we have not fulfilled our obligations to the NATO alliance because we have not submitted the Reform Program to Brussels, but you are not responsible for that.
I cannot promise you what is logical – that politics will be aware of your role and importance in the country and that it will repay you adequately, by improving your status, purchasing better and more modern equipment, and so that you will be safer in carrying out regular and extraordinary tasks.
Given the unhealthy political environment in which we live, as well as the fact that this may be accompanied by some demands that have nothing to do with improving the status of members of the Armed Forces, let us hope that the responsible authorities will not pay attention to petty politics and that these disagreements will be overcome.
In a time when, unfortunately, wars are being waged in Europe and when some countries are once again, violating international law, committing aggression, the importance of the Armed Forces is paramount. That is why the training of soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and officers must be a priority! Without a strong Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state itself cannot count on the protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty. Stable and strong Armed Forces are the main guarantee of the survival and stability of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a lever that must never be called into question by anything.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina can find support in our armed forces, but also a tool for deterring any form of potential violence against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, all together, for the sake of our future, we must and will be committed to strengthening the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and personally, I congratulate all members of the Armed Forces on Armed Forces Day, and I wish you all the best, good health and much success in your future work and private life. Thank you for your attention”."

Because the Bosnian and Herzegovinian anti-fascists at the ZAVNOBiH sessions opted for a unified and indivisible Bosnia and Herzegovina as opposed to the Chetnik project of a greater Serbia and the Ustasha project of a greater Croatia.
ZAVNOBiH is a historical turning point and an epochal defeat of destructive policies that intended to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina.
ZAVNOBiH deserves a new reading, evaluation and contextualization of this historical event.
It is our authentic Bosnian and Herzegovinian product, our great torch of freedom that carries light. Let us illuminate our present and future with the light of ZAVNOBiH.
November 25th should be discussed with new scientific insights, new scientific elaborations, with a new scientific and political understanding of ZAVNOBiH.
In this context, I particularly emphasize the positive role of our state Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ANUBiH), which contributes in all respects to the study and affirmation of the values ​​of ZAVNOBiH.
Ladies and gentlemen,
one of the symbols of the statehood of our homeland is ANUBiH.
ANUBiH was founded on June 22, 1965, and since 2006 it has been a member of the International Union of Academies with headquarters in Brussels.
It is a fundamental national institution, which continuously inherits the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why ANUBiH stands in the path of destructive forces that do not recognize the sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a decision ordering the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina to decide, in accordance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the entering of ANUBiH in the Register of Legal Entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Regardless of the obstructions, ANUBiH will sooner or later be registered as a single state academy.
Science and art cannot be nationalistic. Science and art are universal and must not be reduced to ethnic boundaries.
Our role is to connect the past and the future with knowledge.
We must balance what comes from our past with what the future brings. Bosnia and Herzegovina must find the strength to reject illusions and populism.
In this difficult and complex time, there are no simple and quick solutions. Responsible people know that real political choices rarely involve just one variable. Good decisions require a mix of political, diplomatic, sociological, economic, psychological, historical and other insights.
The adopted Resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica showed us that we need knowledge, courage and character.
The knowledge to design, evaluate and successfully conduct diplomatic activities.
Courage to, despite all obstacles and threats, enter the battle against very strong political, diplomatic, media, intelligence and other structures.
The character to endure in a consistent fight for truth and justice, even when the media attacks were violent and the situation uncertain.
The resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica, as well as some other foreign policy activities, have shown that we do not need to be on the defensive.
We have shown that we have the knowledge, people, capacity and strength. We have proven that we can win even the most difficult diplomatic battles. We confirmed this in New York on May 23 of this year, more than 7,000 kilometres away from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let us be optimistic. Now it is up to us to awaken the spirit that drove the best generations before us.
Dear friends,
our message from Bosnia and Herzegovina is universal: instead of destroying, we build bridges.
Just as our glorious ancestors built bridges, so must we. We are about to complete the construction of the two most important bridges of the 21st century - towards the European and Euro-Atlantic alliances.
Let us not allow anyone to undermine and obstruct the construction of these two bridges. Let us complete their construction in the interests of our people.
In addition to these two bridges, we are simultaneously building many other bilateral bridges of cooperation and friendship, with our numerous friends around the world.
Never in the history of mankind has it been more difficult for an honest man.
We live in a world where we witness the immense suffering of people in Gaza, Ukraine and some other parts of the world.
It is us in Bosnia and Herzegovina who understand the vulnerable and disenfranchised, because we ourselves experienced the suffering during the 1990s.
To us, all human lives are equally valuable.
In ancient Greece and Rome there was a special philosophical school of Hellenistic philosophy called Stoicism.
The Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote a long time ago: ""We cannot choose external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.""
Our role is to design and offer the best answers in the given circumstances, and to inspire people in their implementation.
Responsibly.
Bravely.
With character.
And with the vision of a better and more advanced Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Happy Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina to all people in their homeland, throughout Europe and the world!"
103915,"Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić at the Reception on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the City Hall on November 25, 2024",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103915&langTag=en-US,2024-11-25,"Dear all, before I say a few sentences about the very reason for our gathering tonight, I want to greet everyone present, especially - members of the Mountain Rescue Service and members of the Federal Administration of Civil Protection, and athletes Ismail Barlov and Lejla Njemčević, who are here with us tonight. By all means, greetings and congratulations to the basketball team of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
On November 25, 1943, under conditions of Nazi occupation and quisling terror, the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by the National Liberation Movement, which consisted of various groups of democratically oriented citizens, succeeded at restoring the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It was a historic success which many who fell in the fight against occupiers and traitors were not fortunate enough to experience, as were those who, in the decades preceding it, made a significant contribution to preserving the idea of ​​Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign state, through the political struggle for the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Their dreams of an autonomous status for Bosnia and Herzegovina, both in relation to the empires of the East and the empires of the West, as well as in relation to political Belgrade and political Zagreb, were fulfilled by the fighters of the National Liberation Movement by constituting the Republic with ZAVNOBiH, with Sarajevo as its capital.
The historical step forward that was thus made was not only the fulfillment of the idea of ​​an autonomous position for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also a pledge for the future and a signpost on the path to independence and sovereignty.
November 25th is nothing but the birthplace of March 1st. These are the foundations of the statehood and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although sometimes it seems and perhaps, too often, a dilemma arises as to whether these foundations are sufficient for the survival and progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina, today, in this solemn hour, it should be pointed out that many empires, states and para-states have disappeared, and Bosnia and Herzegovina survived!
It has not been blown away by numerous geopolitical storms precisely because of the foundations that make up its framework. Therefore, we must appreciate more what we have, because nothing we have is by chance.
Some new geopolitical storms will surely blow, and it is us who love this country or the generations which come after us will have some kind of shelter here.
It depends on us whether, how and in what way, on these foundations, we will fortify it for what the future holds.
We cannot and should not expect anyone other than us here to establish and fix the state framework we have. We must be the ones who will strengthen the supporting pillars of our statehood in the face of challenges that will certainly not bypass us.
Appreciating what we have, with awareness of the reality in which we live, I am convinced that we will continue to think about the idea of ​​Bosnia and Herzegovina in a way that we will never give up on the fact that this country should be a state for all its citizens, that we will continue to fight for this idea that is not decades old, but centuries old.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina today carry the same flag of freedom before the European courts that was carried by the partisans in 1943 and that was carried by the fighters of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the MUP (The Ministry of Internal Affairs) of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And that fight itself is like that again, I would say partisan.
We do not have any funds or bags of money with which to buy justice, although, in the world as it is, we should have them too. We have none of that political corruption and unprincipledness which subordinates all morality to self-interest, although, in the world as it is, we should have such too.
Generally speaking, as citizens who want a normal state, we have very little that makes us strong, but I am convinced that no matter how some processes end in which the possibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a normal civil state is called into question, there will always be someone who will continue the fight until the final victory.
Finally, I would like to emphasize that any future struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina will depend on how much of our own strength and knowledge we gather. Bosnia and Herzegovina can be proud of the people it has produced over the past 81 years from ZAVNOBiH. These people, with their strength and acquired knowledge, have preserved the state framework that we possess. And one more message. A message to those who deny the statehood, but also the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is all in vain!
On November 25, 1943, after several centuries, this country restored its statehood.
On March 1, 1992, it gained its independence.
For centuries, they trampled on it, burned it, destroyed it, devastated it, both the country and our way of life, but they didn't succeed.
At one time it seemed that they had caused us irreparable damage. It seemed that every generation of our people, at least once in their life, had to collide with evil and that they had no other choice but to oppose it with all their might.
There is no doubt, as things now stand, that both our enemies and our false friends will continue to try.
Our country, in the emerging world, will be exposed to pressures and challenges, they will break us, they will ask us to bend our backs, they will blackmail us arrogantly and conceitedly, they will use everything they can only to divide us, but we will not give up our statehood and independence.
There is no giving up on Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Long live our only, Bosnia and Herzegovina!
I wish all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina a happy Statehood Day."
103690,"Address by the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović at the final plenary session of the Summit of the European Political Community in Budapest",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103690&langTag=en-US,2024-11-08,"Dear Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to participate in the 5th summit of the European political community and to exchange opinions on our common challenges.
Russia's aggression against Ukraine caused tectonic geopolitical changes in Europe and the world.
Russian aggression has dramatically increased the need for the EU to strengthen its influence in its immediate neighbourhood. Therefore, one of the most important questions is how to prepare the European Union (EU) and the European continent for new threats.
We should primarily build European unity on the common values ​​of freedom, democracy and human rights.
The defence of these values ​​is not the duty of only one state or one organization. It is a common mission of all democratic states, which implies cooperation and solidarity.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we have to face the facts.
The ghosts of the past have been reawakened. Russian aggression revived the policy of territorial expansionism.
Yesterday the victim of territorial expansionism was Bosnia and Herzegovina, today it is Ukraine, and tomorrow it could be any country if we do not stop this evil.
European countries are at a crossroads and have two options.
The first option is the establishment of interstate relations along the lines of the EU states. It means peace, security and development in common interest.
Another option is to adopt the Russian model of relations with neighbours. It is the road to great misfortune and tragedy.
Let's learn from the past and turn to the future.
In Europe, the Iron Curtain has been lowered again. Before us is a long and difficult struggle to save democracy.
This is the time when we are all tested.
In the new circumstances, no one can be neutral. Neutrality is another name for supporting Russia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the free and democratic part of the world.
Let's strengthen security and democracy together. These are the two pillars on which a stable society is founded.
Our efforts should be focused on strengthening democratic institutions by supporting reform processes, civil society and independent media.
With responsible, unified and proactive action, we can improve security on the European continent.
Let's show zero tolerance towards any form of aggression and violation of human rights and freedoms.
Thank you for your attention!
Address the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović at the Summit of the European Political Community in Budapest as part of the panel ""Economic Security""
Ladies and Gentlemen,
economic security is a basic assumption for political stability, as well as for overall economic development and growth.
Economic security allows us to preserve democratic values, freedom and stability on our continent.
Russian aggression against Ukraine also caused a series of economic disturbances across the European continent.
The consequences of Russian aggression and malignant Russian influence also reflect on the economic security of the Western Balkans.
Reductions in the supply of gas and oil led to an increase in energy prices. For developing countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, this represents a serious problem and risk.
Our common interest is to work on new strategies that will strengthen our economic security.
In the following period, stronger action is needed with the aim of:
- diversification of energy sources;
- building a more resilient economic infrastructure,
- investments in renewable energy sources;
- strengthening the economic cooperation of democratic states;
- and finding more effective answers to the economic challenges we face.
Cooperation amongst the European countries is particularly important in the areas of security, energy independence and efficiency, connectivity, migration and economy. These areas are of key importance for the economic security of the European continent.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a reliable contributor to European economic security.
My country has an important geopolitical and strategic position. Bosnia and Herzegovina has the potential to be a regional transport and logistics hub, connecting Central Europe with the Adriatic Sea, Eastern Europe and Asia.
By investing more in infrastructure and modernizing border crossings, we will streamline trade routes and strengthen the resilience of the European supply chain.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports and contributes to strengthening Europe's energy security.
In that process, Bosnia and Herzegovina can play an important role in gas transit and electricity distribution from Southeast Europe to the EU countries, actively contributing to energy diversification.
Diversification of supply routes and better connection of electricity and gas networks in the Western Balkans would enable more flexible access to energy in crisis situations.
In this context, I particularly emphasize the importance of the Southern Gas Interconnection.
This project would enable the connection of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU gas network, which would have an importance for the economic security.
Southern interconnection is a strategic project aimed at ensuring energy independence.
Our highly developed dedicated industry can also contribute to the European economic security.
Targeted investments could develop additional capacities, which can be fully adapted to NATO standards.
Thank you for your attention!"
103529,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović at the session of the United Nations Security Council,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103529&langTag=en-US,2024-11-01,"The witnesses of the Dayton Agreement, who are active in the Peace Implementation Council and the UN, should sound the red alarm because of the threats to peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
It is very important that the Steering Committee of the Peace Implementation Council adopted a clear interpretation of the three important elements for ensuring peace and stability.
Sovereignty belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a single state whose territorial integrity is guaranteed, among other things, by the General Framework Agreement for Peace.
Entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina are not states, they exist solely on the basis of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and do not have their own sovereignty.
The international community maintains the necessary instruments to ensure the implementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the leadership of the Republic of Serbia is aggressively interfering in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as some other countries in the region.
One of the proofs of my claim is the adopted Declaration of the so-called of the All-Serb Assembly in Belgrade, June 8 of this year. Except for the so-called the All-Serb Assembly, the Declaration was adopted in the Assembly of Serbia and the Assembly of the Republika Srpska entity.
The so-called the All-Serb Assembly cannot be superior to the state bodies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and declare the military neutrality of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
One of the vice presidents of the Government of the Republic of Serbia recently openly admitted that ""the unification of Serbia and Republika Srpska has begun."" This is dangerous and absolutely unacceptable.
It is time to tell the truth about Serbia's real intentions here in the UN Security Council.
The essential goal of the leadership of Serbia is the gradual Anschluss of the Republika Srpska entity into Serbia.
It tries to achieve this goal by abusing parallel connections. Let me remind you that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly states that parallel relations with neighbouring countries can be established ""in accordance with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina"". Declaration of the so-called of All-Serb Assembly is contrary to the Dayton Agreement and the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For these and numerous other reasons, the High Representative was obliged to repeal this anti-Dayton declaration. It is not just a declarative act, but a dangerous large-state program document.
Unfortunately, the High Representative has not yet done so.
I call on the international community, especially the EU, to clearly condemn the reactivation of the Greater Serbia project.
This concerns not only Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also the whole of Europe. Let us stop the revival of the dangerous concept ""one nation, one parliament"" on time.
It is especially unacceptable that the leadership of Serbia does not respect international law, as well as the final and binding verdicts of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the state property of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
State property is an inseparable part of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Dayton, the infamous President of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, tried to divide state property between the entities.
Milošević did not achieve this goal during the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as during the negotiations in Dayton. The international community must not allow this war objective to be achieved in peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I consider it important that the UN Security Council adopted the Decision on the extension of the mandate of EUFOR/Althea.
The presence of EUFOR is important for preserving peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the region.
Also, NATO's message that it will not allow a security vacuum in Bosnia and Herzegovina is very important. Let us not forget, NATO's mandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is precisely defined by Annex 1-A of the Dayton Agreement.
The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is connected with the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has an obligation to ensure the individual rights of citizens, not only the collective rights of the people. It is time for retrograde forces to stop obstructing the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
Pressure on the European Court of Human Rights due to the latest verdict in the case of Slaven Kovačević is inadmissible. We must eliminate every form of discrimination against citizens, including discrimination based on ethnic and territorial grounds.
It is our obligation to harmonize the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina with international law and generally accepted democratic principles and practices. In that process, it is necessary to strengthen the democratic and multi-ethnic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has accepted the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as part of international obligations within the Dayton Agreement, thereby assuming responsibility for the protection of human rights according to the highest European standards.
Bosnia and Herzegovina does not need selective application of this convention.
The Constitution of BiH stipulates the direct application of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the priority of this convention over every other right.
Bosnia and Herzegovina needs democratic solutions to overcome current challenges.
In this sense, I think we should focus on:
- consistent and comprehensive implementation of all aspects of the Dayton Agreement;
- harmonization of the Constitution of BiH, in accordance with the requirements of the European Court for Human Rights;
- acceptance of the EU acquis.
My country needs a political system that will ensure equal rights and a better future for all citizens."
103488,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović at the Business Forum of Business persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103488&langTag=en-US,2024-10-30,"It is our intention that companies from both countries explore complementary business opportunities, enter into new partnerships and improve their presence on regional and European markets.
Our two countries nurture friendly ties, which were further strengthened today by the visit of President Milatović.
In the spirit of this successful cooperation, I am particularly pleased to point out that the economic relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are continuously strengthening.
The total trade exchange between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in 2023 amounted to over 401 million Euros and is higher by about 23 million Euros compared to 2022.
Our two countries are recording positive trends in foreign trade exchange.
The growth of exports and imports, along with the increased diversification of products in foreign trade exchange, and the investments of Montenegro in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the amount of 110 million Euros, from 2021 to 2024, represent only some of the indicators of successful cooperation between our countries.
Today, we managed to organize business meetings of business persons from the energy, agriculture, wood industry, transport and information technology sectors.
These sectors form the backbone of our economy and have the potential for development, innovation and the creation of new jobs. Energy ensures stability and sustainability, agriculture strengthens our food security, the wood industry uses our natural resources responsibly, transportation connects markets, while information technologies accelerate our integration into the global economy.
I hope that this business forum will open up new opportunities for expanding cooperation and attracting new investments.
I would like to point out that, in addition to these sectors, there is significant potential for improving cooperation in the field of tourism between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
Our mutual cooperation, supported by strategic investments, can create a solid and sustainable framework that will position both countries as attractive and competitive destinations on the global tourism scene.
The wealth of natural beauty, cultural heritage and hospitality that our countries share represent a unique potential for the development of a common tourist offer.
Investments in this sector, especially through the improvement of tourist and transport infrastructure, as well as increased promotion, provide an extraordinary opportunity for deeper economic connection, the creation of new jobs and the creation of a dynamic platform for development.
Capital is looking for countries and regions with a good and safe perspective.
The perspective of our countries and our region is accelerated integration into the European Union, accompanied by constant strengthening of economic development and growth. It is a vision that we are gradually implementing.
European and Euro-Atlantic integrations are the best way to preserve security and progress. Integration processes are the best means for transforming our country, for strengthening the rule of law, for building a competitive market economy, as well as for improving the business climate.
Special attention should be paid to the modernization of traffic and communication infrastructure, with the aim of strengthening the overall economic cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
Through joint work and strategic investments in infrastructure development, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro should speed up activities that will better connect the two countries.
In this regard, projects such as the modernization of road communication between Sarajevo and Podgorica, and the construction of the interstate ""Tara"" bridge between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, are of great importance.
These, as well as a number of other infrastructural projects, are extremely important for facilitating traffic, strengthening business ties, but also for creating a more favourable environment for attracting investment and creating new jobs.
In order to further improve the cooperation between our countries, we are working on simplifying procedures and attracting investments.
That way, we should enable a faster flow of goods and services, and more favourable conditions will attract additional investments in sectors such as energy, tourism and industry.
The development of joint infrastructure projects, such as the ""Tara"" interstate bridge, the Čapljina-Trebinje-Nikšić-Podgorica railway and the Adriatic-Ionian highway, will help reduce transport costs and facilitate trade, creating new business opportunities in our border areas.
Additionally, regular holding of business forums and B2B meetings enables companies from our countries to find new partners and expand the business network, which will significantly contribute to the growth of trade exchange.
Agreements that are in the process of being concluded should also contribute to a better connection between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let this forum be a platform for exchanging ideas, creating new business opportunities and building solid partnerships.
Let our decisions be guided by a vision of prosperity and long-term economic development for all our citizens.
With business forums, like this one, we open opportunities for concrete investment projects, transfer of advanced technologies and connection of experts, thereby further bringing our markets closer to European standards and values.
I invite investors from Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina to take advantage of the favourable conditions and numerous opportunities for investing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our country offers numerous benefits for doing business and support to investments.
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all participants of this forum. I am convinced that the Business Forum will further strengthen our interstate relations and open up new opportunities for cooperation.
We are working together on reforms that will ultimately improve the business environment, eliminate administrative barriers, and put public administration at the service of investors and business community.
Dear friends from Montenegro,
I wish you, as our guests, to feel comfortable in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, exchanging experiences and ideas, and building new partnerships for mutual benefit.
Thank you for your attention!"
103339,"The speech by the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović at the Academy on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the death of the first president of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103339&langTag=en-US,2024-10-18,"Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies and Eminences, former members of the Presidency of the RBiH and BiH, respected members of the Izetbegović family, I am honoured to speak at the Academy on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the death of the first president of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović.
Statesman, first president, supreme commander, thinker, philosopher, fighter for human rights, humanist, lawyer, these are just some of the words that describe the character and work of the late Alija Izetbegović.
Tonight we gathered to pay our respects to this great and deserving man, who left an indelible mark in the modern history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The first president of the Presidency of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina entrusted us with the protection of the homeland, togetherness and humanity.
This wise and courageous man taught us during his life, with words and deeds, not to respond to barbarism with barbarism, hatred with hatred, destruction with destruction.
He acted and made decisions in the most difficult possible conditions. He never surrendered to the politics of evil and hatred. He believed in and fought for a state where all citizens would have equal rights and freedoms.
Members of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RBH): Mirko Pejanović, Tatjana Ljujić-Mijatović, Nijaz Duraković, Stjepan Kljujić, Ejup Ganić and Ivo Komšić worked with Alija Izetbegović during the most difficult times of war.
The multi-ethnic Presidency of the RBiH was in the function of defending the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We cannot and must never give up on multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The RBiH Presidency, headed by Alija Izetbegović, adopted a document entitled ""Platform for the Activities of the BiH Presidency in Wartime Conditions"".
At the time of brutal aggression, when the destroyers of Bosnia and Herzegovina were adopting documents on the separation of peoples, on June 26, 1992, the Presidency of the RBiH adopted a Platform that talks about life together, peace, equality, human rights and freedoms.
This bright historical document had fundamental programmatic and political importance in defining and realizing the concept of defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even today it can be a guide for the future.
The legal Presidency of the RBiH, headed by Alija Izetbegović, also adopted the Decree on the formation of the Army of the RBiH.
It is one of the most important decisions in the long history of our country. In the time of the most difficult challenges and temptations, it defended the country and freedom.
The army of the RBiH and its supreme command led by Alija Izetbegović were essentially different from those who attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Army of the RBiH led a defensive-liberation struggle and did not fight on the territories of other countries, nor for the interests of other countries.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we will not allow anyone to equate defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina with convicted war criminals. Not to High Representative Christian Schmidt, not to anyone else.
We will not allow anyone to trample on our history and our great men. Accepting a historical lie is a crime in peace!
Legal and illegal, humane and criminal, civilized and anti-civilized cannot and must not be equated.
We will never remain silent when Bosnia and Herzegovina and its most deserving sons and daughters are attacked.
And let all those who do not have honourable intentions towards our country remember that well.
We will continue to speak loud and clear! We will continue to expose big-state policies against which the late president Alija Izetbegović also fought.
In the fight against destructive policies, we must not allow more energy to be spent on inter-party conflicts than on the defence and development of the state.
Attempts to discredit the first president Alija Izetbegović and other figures responsible for the preservation and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina are part of a dangerous project.
The state is under attack. The Bosnian language is under attack. Our culture, history, tradition and faith are under attack.
That is why we must recognize the dangers and strengthen our collective resistance to lies and hoaxes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has always had its sons and daughters who will defend it. That is how it has been and that is how it will stay.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the first president of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović, permanently entrusted us with legacy.
It is our duty to honour the trust with dignity.
We will do it best if we fight for a lofty goal: Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state and society of equal and free people, a state in which different identities are respected, but also builds a common national identity
The first president, Alija Izetbegović, also strove for this goal.
Eternal Rahma and thanks be to him!"
103289,Address by Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović at the meeting of leaders of the Brdo,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103289&langTag=en-US,2024-10-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the presidents of the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Croatia and Montenegro for organizing this forum. The Brdo - Brioni process is an important platform for strengthening regional cooperation and promoting European values.
Unfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina was hit by a catastrophic natural disaster five days ago.
Devastating floods and landslides affected several cities and towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have lost what is most valuable – human lives. The homes of many of our fellow citizens were destroyed, and the overall material damage is enormous.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from all parts of our country, have once again shown a big heart and enormous solidarity.
I want to thank everyone who sent us words of support, expressed solidarity and specifically helped us in the past few days.
Thanks to everyone in the region, Europe and the world who expressed their willingness to help. In these difficult times, quick reaction and international support are of great importance to us.
The tragic floods and landslides in Bosnia and Herzegovina show that it is very important that we all pay much more attention to the prevention and reduction of the risk of natural disasters.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards neighbouring and other countries is based, above all, on respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as on equality in interstate relations.
By actively participating in regional initiatives, Bosnia and Herzegovina positions itself as a proactive and constructive partner. In this respect, we will continue to actively support regional cooperation, including the Brdo-Brioni process initiative.
All member states of the Brdo - Brioni Process are members or want-to-be members of the European Union (EU). This, among other things, implies that we learn from the experience of the EU, as well as that we build interstate relations according to the good practices of the EU member states.
The key European countries that built the foundations of the EU have decided to abandon big-state projects and to cooperate on the basis of appreciation and respect.
It is a fundamental commitment that has enabled peace and progress in Europe. This is the key message, and this message must finally be understood by all the countries of the Western Balkans.
The countries of the Western Balkans are at a crossroads and have two options.
The first option is the establishment of interstate relations in accordance to the those practised by the EU states. That option means peace, security and development that is in common interest.
The second option is to adopt the Russian model of relations with neighbours. It is the road to great misfortune and tragedy.
Let's learn from the past, especially the tragic 90s, and turn to the future.
Let's open space for projects that bring economic and any other progress.
Let's take advantage of the EU's willingness to support regional connectivity projects through various funds and initiatives.
Let's take responsibility for their implementation.
The intensification of the Berlin Process and the implementation of the initiated agreements and arrangements are benefits for all countries of the region. We need to make a joint contribution to the accelerated implementation of all four agreements from the Berlin Process.
Mobility agreements are of great importance for the integration of the Western Balkans into the single European market. It is time to end the obstruction of the ratification of the Agreement on freedom of movement with identity cards in the Western Balkans.
The only remaining visa regime in the region is between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Ratification of this important agreement would enable easier implementation of other agreements from the Berlin Process.
The EU growth plan for the Western Balkans is of particular importance for the overall development of the region.
The growth plan is not only an economic incentive, but also an important political message - the EU supports us and recognizes the Western Balkans as an integral part of its future.
One of the key preconditions for the economic development and integration of the region is the improvement of connectivity - infrastructural, digital and energy.
Better connectivity within our region, as well as with the EU, is key to strengthening trade, investment and mobility.
It is our responsibility to ensure that the Western Balkans move forward – towards full integration into the EU and towards sustainable development that will benefit all our citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the prosperous future of the region is not in an arms race.
The countries of the region need more investments in economic development. Therefore, I propose that we stop the current arms race.
Let's strengthen peace, security and building of good-neighbourly relations. Such a proposal is in line with the subregional arms control agreement.
Instead of an arms race in the region, I suggest we focus on faster economic development.
All the countries of the region would benefit from this, while the possibility of conflict would be significantly reduced.
Thank you for your attention."

Have we learned the fundamental lessons of history after World War II?
Here, at the UN Security Council session, I am warning in particular about the danger of the recently held, so-called All-Serb Assembly in Belgrade.
The declaration adopted at this pan-ethnic assembly flagrantly threatens the independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as some other countries in Southeast Europe.
Also, the Declaration of the so-called of the All-Serb Assembly is contrary to international law and represents an extremely dangerous policy with potential unfathomable consequences.
The establishment of pan-ethnic assemblies is a threat to peaceful and equal cooperation among UN member states.
ladies and gentlemen,
let's decide together that the 21st century be a century of peace, not a century of new tragedies.
During the 1990s, Bosnia and Herzegovina survived brutal aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes.
Because of this, my country especially values ​​peace and freedom.
Furthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina actively contributes to the affirmation of peace and peaceful relations between states.
Our message is crystal clear: instead of renewing big-state policies, let's turn to economic development and cooperation.
This is in our common interest.
Thank you for your attention!"

It is a special honour for me to address the 79th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN), as the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Allow me, Mr. President, to wish you every success in these complex and challenging times. Furthermore, I congratulate former President Mr Dennis Francis for successfully presiding over the 78th session of the UN General Assembly.
Dear President,
it is a great honour to serve the unvanquished state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the oldest European states.
We are proud of the fact that the country of Bosnia has been mentioned in historical sources for 1,075 years. For centuries, my country has shown resilience, courage and the strength of unity in diversity. It was not created in Dayton in 1995, but the Dayton Peace Agreement did confirm the continuity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These are unquestionable historical and legal facts.
Since the end of the war in 1995 until today, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made great progress.
We rebuilt the country destroyed by the war. We united the defence system, the judiciary, the tax system and numerous other institutions.
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the doorstep of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively working towards becoming a member of NATO and the EU. These are our strategic foreign policy goals, which were unanimously defined by the state authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the whole world is facing numerous challenges and dangers.
Unfortunately, we live in a world of injustice, insecurity and intolerance.
Never in history has man had more power and, at the same time, never felt more insecure than he does today.
In the past two years, we have faced new difficult challenges, especially those regarding security. The strengthening of authoritarian populism, the aggression against Ukraine and the suffering of Gaza have thrown humanity into a deep crisis, with a lot of uncertainty and fear.
The world is seriously threatened by poverty, disease, natural disasters, wars and injustice.
It is estimated that every four seconds, one person dies of hunger. The fact that millions of children in the world live in extreme poverty is particularly sad.
A justified question arises: why did we allow it to be incomparably more investment in weapons than in eradicating poverty? It's time for everyone to realize that human lives are more important than guns. Otherwise, I fear that we are collectively headed for a global catastrophe.
Regarding climate change, Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully aware of the global situation and is determined to contribute to global efforts.
We are committed to the transition to renewable energy sources and the reduction of harmful gas emissions.
Terrorism is a serious threat. Countering this danger requires joint and determined efforts.
The world must have a consensus in the fight against terrorism. Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to show a determined commitment to the fight against terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen,
without discovering the cause, we cannot solve the problems of modern humanity.
We cannot stop the movement of history, but we can have an impact on its direction. Therefore, I suggest that we focus on:
- preserving the role of the UN as a global centre of coordination and cooperation;
- the importance of reaffirming the UN Charter;
- strengthening the multilateral system, in accordance with international law;
- intensification of the reform processes in the UN;
- joint action to strengthen the credibility of the UN;
- efficient implementation of Agenda 2030 and its sustainable development goals;
- restore trust and cooperation among nations on key global issues;
- providing a chance for mutual trust, inclusiveness and a democratic vision of leadership;
- and to strengthen preventive diplomacy in the time of geopolitical fragmentation of the world."
103044,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Denis Bećirović at the UN's Summit of the Future,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=103044&langTag=en-US,2024-09-22,"Dear Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, Dear friends, it is an honour to address the Summit of the Future, which should chart the path to a more prosperous future.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is firmly committed to the fundamental principles of the United Nations. We are aware of numerous global threats and challenges, which far exceed the capacities of any single country.
We believe that global challenges can only be answered through high-quality international cooperation, which implies an efficient and coordinated global response.
It is imperative to establish a strong multilateral system that ensures inclusiveness.
Only through joint work, solidarity and mutual respect can we create the world of security, justice and prosperity.
It is time for concrete actions that will ensure peace and stability for future generations.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to contribute to global stability and prosperity.
A pact for the future is very necessary at the time when democracy and multilateralism are in crisis.
The United Nations should be more effective in preventing conflicts, building peace and fighting terrorism.
The painful experience of my country shows that the indecision of the UN, even in UN safe zones, leads to tragic consequences. One of the examples that speak of this is the genocide committed against Bosniaks in Srebrenica in 1995. Let's learn lessons from the past for the sake of a common future.
The character of today's challenges clearly identifies the path of our response.
That is why multilateralism is the best answer.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the global goals of stopping climate change.
We support the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its roadmap. We are actively working to improve policies in this area.
International peace and the affirmation of human rights are a prerequisite for progress.
Only by strengthening human rights can we build societies that are more resilient to conflicts, injustices and inequalities.
The UN represents a key organization for international cooperation and a platform for preventive diplomacy.
Diplomacy and dialogue are primary for the peaceful resolution of disputes and overcoming divisions, but also as a means of improving cooperation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will persistently work to strengthen such a role of the UN.
The future belongs to the young generations.
I am personally vested in engaging young people, not as a symbolic inclusion, but as a concrete involvement in the shaping of policies at the national and global level.
We can draw inspiration for a more secure future from the UN Charter.
The pact for the future has enormous potential to reshape our multilateral system, ensuring concrete benefits for all.
Bosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the implementation of key proposals in the Pact.
I invite all of us to immediately begin the concrete and comprehensive implementation of the Pact for the Future adopted today.
I believe that the Summit of the Future: Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow opens a new chapter in the process of strengthening multilateralism, which we are all in need of.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to cooperate with all the countries gathered at this Summit, in connection with the preservation of our planet and a safer future for new generations.
Thank you for your attention!"

Speech:
""Dear Nanić family,
families of martyrs and fallen fighters, war-disabeled, comrades,
members of the Army of the Republic of BiH and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of BiH,
Bužim women and Bužim men,
not to forget, I also greet the members of the Bosniak honour platoon as defenders of the Republic of Croatia here in Bužim, because they come here every year.
Dear guests,
congratulations to the organizers who, now in the traditional way, mark this 32nd anniversary of the formation of the 505th Knight's Mountain Brigade as part of the Freedom Days manifestation of the Knight's City of Bužim. Many should emulate Bužim, their attitude towards their commander Izet Nanić, towards the fighters and the aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Everything that happened today is somehow related to everything that happened on Ljuta greda and to the story surrounding the monument to General Alagić. Maybe we, as the Prime Minister said, will be in a statement, but I want to say something. I don't like to blame anyone or complain about anyone, but I want to say to those who are bothered by something like this, who are bothered by what happened at Ljuta Greda, who are also bothered by General Alagić, don't say that they won't be bothered by General Nanić tomorrow either. You never know! I just want to tell them: How are you not ashamed of yourselves!? How are you not ashamed, when you look in the mirror, to put us on the same level with villains and evildoers who have all this evil on their souls, on their policies, including the genocide in Srebrenica?
How are you not ashamed of yourselves? Why are you doing this? Do you think that this is the way to a peaceful Bosnia? Bosnia can only be peaceful on the truth. And the truth is that all of us, as members of the Army of the RBiH and the MIA of the RBiH, and all those people who were involved in the defence of BiH, have never taken anything from anyone of that is not ours. We defended our own, we never reached for someone else's and we don't do that, i tis not us. We were not taught or raised that way. But that's why we will defend with blood what is ours! Why are you trying to humiliate us? You will not be able to humiliate us! What's the problem when you say you love your country? In our country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is enough room for everyone.
Those against whom we fought, they started to take from us, they killed those of us. What is the problem with the fact that we defended ourselves? I respect our international friends, but don't lie. For two years you left us to die, for two years you let us be slaughtered and killed, and then when we created an Army that became a real force, only then did you start to think about what we were saying. But that's when our problem with you started. What's the problem with us loving this country? This is our homeland, there is no other! I say this a little bitterly because I was disappointed by some things after Vlašić.
It was a genocide against a people, those people in Srebrenica were killed only because they were Bosniaks and Muslims! Why is it a problem to admit it? Why is it a problem with our supposed friends to say that? Name the one who did it!?
The presence of Bužim residents and weterans in large numbers tonight and in the past few days, the respect they show towards the 505th brigade, towards Nanić and the Army and MIA of RBiH, is the strongest message that can be sent from Bužim.
I will be at disposal to you and to this country as long as my wits and health serve me, and I hope that I will not lose either for a long time."""
102511,"BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić attended the event ""Days of Victory, Days of Pride"" and the opening of the memorial ""General Mehmed Alagić Ljiljan",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=102511&langTag=en-US,2024-08-04,"After laying a wreath on the memorial, BiH Presidency Member Komšić addressed the many visitors to the event in the “Freedom and Peace Park” Memorial Complex, Ljuta Greda:
“Respected families of shaheeds and fallen soldiers, members of the Alagić family, war disabled, comrades, ladies and gentlemen in order and honour, not to go further so that I don’t skip anyone, and they get angry later…
First of all, thank you to the people who carried out all this, designed, worked, helped and gathered us here today, on this occasion. It’s important, maybe it doesn’t seem that way to some, it’s important that there are places like this. It is important not only to say thank you to the people who fought and prevailed to make this country free. It is important, above all, because of these children who came today with their parents to this plateau. So kudos to you for this! Kudos to you for not hating it, for not being difficult, for begging, walking, collecting and finally making this monument.
The second thing that seems important to me, and it concerns a little bit of the past - may they forgive me, it’s really not my goal to attack or offend anyone… Today we’re talking about General Alagić, who, just like Bosnia and Herzegovina, is ours. His work was great and magnificent, but let's be human, so let's admit that his fate was tragic. We all know that, there's no need to run away from it. We will be better people if we say it and admit it. We all know that, basically, his heart broke because of the injustice, the betrayal of those parties from whom he did not expect it. And that needs to be said.
Because, you see, even today there are some other generals who found themselves in the same position as General Alagić. Does anyone think about Dudaković, does anyone think about that man? Does anyone think about the people who were unfairly accused of Dobrovoljačka? Let's not wait for their hearts to burst with grief, so that we can gather together and say: 'They were great people!'
Let's not do that. That is correct, General Alagić is a special story. And you said it right, commander, without fighters he wouldn’t have been able to do anything. You can be as smart and big as you want, but if people and the nation don't trust you, you won't be able to do anything. He was the one people followed and trusted. Which was also his greatness. There are still such people, they are alive. Don't let us forget them! Don't let us talk about how great they were after they die!
And one more thing. All this that is being done to us who have gone through, all these things that the people on Ljuta greda and on the Vlašić plateau, in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina have gone through, is important. The older we get, the softer we get on these things. The older we get, these kinds of manifestations, these kinds of occasions, bring out a few tears that are left in us. But it is also important because of these children. These children who come after us should be told, not to brag about who we are and what we were, they should be told to learn something from the fight that was done for this country. We need to instil that love in them, so that they too will be ready to defend this country if, God forbid, it is necessary.
I will address one more thing. The words unity and togetherness were mentioned here on several occasions. Okay, I agree. But let's agree on what the unity and togetherness are. If it's unity and togetherness about this here, fine. If it is unity and togetherness about the fact that we will not betray our heroes and push them underground, fine, it can be done. If it's unity and togetherness around the fact that we can say to ourselves: 'No one will ever take an inch of this land away from here, not even an inch', fine. But if that unity and togetherness should be formed around false compromises, around lies, around flattering some powerful and bigger than us, I, nor the people, will join you in that unity. I'm not into those things! Therefore, when we talk about unity, let us define what it is that we’re gathering around. If we’re gathering around what was important in '92, it's okay brother, that's not a problem! But if something is a lie and hypocrisy, if it's rotten compromises, don't count on me in that unity. I cannot! I'm old enough to tell you that and I do not really care what anyone thinks about it!
Dear friends, comrades, thank you for the opportunity to be here with you today. Once again, all congratulations for this, all congratulations for what you did in Galica. And we will, I hope and God willing, see each other again""."
102286,Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović addressed the summit of the European Political Community,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=102286&langTag=en-US,2024-07-18,"Chairman of BiH Presidency Dr Denis Bećirović is participating in the summit of the European Political Community (EPC) in Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. On that occasion, he spoke at a round table on the topic of defence and strengthening of democracy. The round table was chaired by the President of the Republic of France, Emmanuel Macron.
In his address, the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović emphasized, among other things, that the war of aggression that Moscow started in Ukraine changed political discussions and priorities throughout Europe and the world. He also said that the future of free and democratic Europe largely depends on the outcome of this war, and that therefore one of the most important questions is how to prepare the European Union (EU) and the European continent for new threats and challenges. The Ukrainian crisis has dramatically increased the need for the EU to strengthen its influence in its immediate neighbourhood.
""European unity is now more important than ever since the Second World War. This is of strategic importance, especially in the current global situation. We should primarily build unity on the common values ​​of freedom, democracy and human rights. Defence of security and democracy is not the duty of only one state or one organization. It is a common mission of all democratic states, which implies cooperation and solidarity. Bosnia and Herzegovina consistently joins the statements and positions of the EU in the field of foreign and security policy,"" said Dr Bećirović.
""We must strengthen security and democracy. These are the two pillars on which a stable society rests.
Without security, democratic institutions lose their purpose. That is why it is important to strengthen security structures, rule of law and promote democratic values. Our efforts should be focused on strengthening democratic institutions through support for reform processes, civil society and independent media,"" said Dr Bećirović.
Chairman of BiH Presidency Dr Denis Bećirović emphasized that the European political community is becoming an important platform for international cooperation, and that it is a good opportunity to improve existing cooperation. Furthermore, this community can find additional space for cooperation between states in the energy sector, transport, investments, infrastructure and free movement of persons."

Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović addressed the dignitaries, including members of the UK Government and both houses of the UK Parliament.
At the beginning, Dr Bećirović expressed his gratitude to the UK Government and Parliament for affirming the truth about the genocide committed against Bosniaks in Srebrenica. He particulary thanked Chairman of the ""Remembering Srebrenica"" Foundation, Dr Waqar Azmi and friends from this foundation.
""Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina highly appreciate the engagement of the United Kingdom, which, in 2015, proposed the United Nations Security Council (UN) Resolution on Srebrenica. Unfortunately, the adoption of the text of the resolution was stopped by the Russian Federation. However, they did not stop us in the fight for justice. The resolution was adopted by the UN General Assembly in May of this year. Thanks to the United Kingdom and numerous other countries that voted for this resolution. The adoption of the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica represents a highly moral and civilizing act of the UN General Assembly,"" Dr Bećirović.
During his address in London, the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović stressed that Europe and the world must learn lessons from Srebrenica and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
""Every evil that we don't stop at the beginning becomes bigger and more dangerous later. Together, let's stop the new evil in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The aggression against Ukraine should be a reminder of what happens when dangerous policies are ignored. In Europe and the world, we need to build a culture of remembrance of the genocide in Srebrenica. With the culture of memory, we fight for democracy and human rights. By remembering, we fight for a safe future for new generations. Thank you, United Kingdom, for preserving the truth about the genocide in Srebrenica. Thank you, United Kingdom, for all the help to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are a country that remembers and appreciates its friends and allies"", concluded Dr Bećirović.
Last year, Dr Bećirović also participated in the commemoration on the occasion of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland National Srebrenica Memorial Day, which was held at Lancaster House in London."
102225,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of marking the 29th anniversary of genocide against Bosniaks of the “UN Safe Zone Srebrenica” and burial of identified victims fro,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=102225&langTag=en-US,2024-07-11,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, respected families of genocide victims, excellencies, eminences, dear friends from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, we have gathered today to send the remains of another 14 innocent victims of the genocide against Bosniaks to their eternal rest.
It is our human duty to express our condolences to their families, as well as to the families of all victims of genocide in and around Srebrenica.
We must pay special respect to the Mothers of Srebrenica. They are the true heroines of our time.
Their courage and unwavering spirit serve as an inspiration to us all. Their fight for truth and justice reminds us of the importance of individual action in the fight against evil and injustice.
The strength of the heroines of Srebrenica and Podrinje reminds us that even in the darkest moments, love is stronger than hate, and truth is stronger than lies.
The General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica.
For the first time, we are marking the commemoration of the victims of genocide with the adopted resolution. Thank you to the friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina from all over the world who supported the adoption of the Resolution.
This is one of the most important diplomatic, political and moral victories of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 21st century dedicated to the victims of genocide and their families.
The implementation of the adopted resolution has begun, and no one can stop it. One of the results of the adoption of the Resolution is that already this year, we are commemorating the Day of Remembrance of the Genocide in Srebrenica in the building of the United Nations.
Today's international commemoration in New York is organized by the Permanent Mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the UN. From next year, the organization of the commemoration will be taken over by the Secretary General and the UN Secretariat.
In the coming period, as long as human civilization exists, 11th of July will be the International Day of Remembrance of the Genocide in Srebrenica. No one can erase that anymore.
We respect neighbouring Serbia and its citizens. We do not put a sign of equality between the regime and the people. We want peace and cooperation based on equality.
Unfortunately, peace and cooperation based on equality are endangered by the big-state policy of the regime in Belgrade.
This is a policy that, using the example of the Resolution on the Srebrenica genocide, has shown that it tries to turn obvious defeats into victories.
On the other hand, Bosnian-Herzegovinian politics must not fall into the trap of turning an obvious victory into a defeat. We must not allow that.
The implementation of this resolution does not depend on those who failed to stop it. It depends on us, but on the condition that we do not accept the narrative of genocide deniers.
The UN courts have ruled that genocide against Bosniaks was committed, as well as a joint criminal enterprise against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, despite these judgments, the bodies of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian entity of RS threaten the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That is why it is important for us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to answer the question: are there similarities between the situation at the beginning of 1992 and today?
I will try to present the answer to this question in eight theses:
- convicted war criminal Radovan Karadžić and his associates said in 1992 that ""Bosnia and Herzegovina is an impossible state"". Today, the leaders of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian entity of RS are saying it again;
- In 1992, the Greater Serbian protagonists publicly said that their goal was Greater Serbia. The highest representatives of the BiH entity of the RS publicly say again that their goal is Greater Serbia, despite the fact that aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes were committed because of that dangerous project;
- In 1992, the followers of Greater Serbia first took the path of legal violence, destroying international and national law. Today, they again threaten legal violence against the constitutional order;
- In 1992, the Greater Serbian protagonists withdrew judges from the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and destroyed the constitutional order. Today they are doing it again;
- In 1992, the protagonists of Greater Serbia threatened the disappearance of both the state and Bosniaks. Today, they again threaten the disappearance of the state and the ghettoization of Bosniaks on 25% of the state territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- In the 1990s, the Greater Serbian protagonists were persistently against the presence of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. When the international community withdrew, they committed genocide. Today, they are again asking for the withdrawal of the international community;
- Before 1992, the Greater Serbian planners created the SANU Memorandum, which was the dynamite with which they destroyed Yugoslavia and started wars of aggression. 34 days ago, the so-called Declaration was adopted of the All-Serbian Parliament. Europe and the world must be aware that this Vučić’s declaration is more dangerous and scandalous than the SANU Memorandum;
- Slobodan Milošević and Radovan Karadžić were at the head of the Great Serbian project in 1992. The recorded telephone conversations between the two clearly show that Milošević was the boss and Karadžić was the executor. Their agreement was that Milosevic was deceiving the West, and that Karadžić was implementing his policy on the ground. I invite everyone to consider what role Aleksandar Vučić and Milorad Dodik play today;
Finally, to answer the question about the similarities between the situation in 1992 and today. The historical context, balance of power and global circumstances are not the same, but, unfortunately, there are numerous similarities between the Great Serbian ideology and politics of 1992 and the current one. We must not underestimate that.
How to defend Bosnia and Herzegovina more efficiently in the time ahead?
For the future of our country, it is of crucial importance that everyone understands two key messages.
First, only the state and state institutions can protect us from danger.
Second, uninformed, uneducated and quarrelsome people attract those with evildoers like a magnet.
Only people who are trained, equipped and willing to defend themselves deter potential perpetrators of genocide. It is a lesson we must learn well.
We must dispel falsehoods with arguments and work persistently on the realization of foreign policy priorities.
In March 2024, the EU made a decision to open negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are in the heart of Europe and our place is in the European Union.
We are on the verge of membership in NATO. NATO is a safe haven that guarantees peace and security to all people in our country.
Our task is to fight for a secure future and strengthen our alliances.
It is important that we cooperate diligently and thoughtfully with our friends in European and North American countries, but also Asian, African and Latin American countries, as well as with Australia and Oceania.
We must strengthen old friendships and build new ones where we can.
The adopted Resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica further showed us how important it is.
Our path is to build a fairer future.
If we forget the tragic past along the way, it can happen again.
Let's study the paths of the past in order to more safely navigate the paths of the future.
We send a message of peace and appreciation to all well-intentioned people in our country and region.
We have lived together for centuries and we will live together in the future.
Finally, I once again send words of respect, sympathy and solidarity to all those who have lost their loved ones."
101915,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the ""Summit on Peace in Ukraine"", Lucerne (Bürgenstock), Switzerland, June, 15-16 2024",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101915&langTag=en-US,2024-06-16,"Dear Excellencies, first of all, I want to thank H.E. Viola Amherd, President of the Swiss Confederation for taking over the role of host, and for the excellent organization of this important summit.
Supporting Ukraine means supporting the protection of international law and the basic principles on which the civilized world rests.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a victim of brutal aggression from 1992 to 1995, fully understands the suffering of the citizens of Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Europe is once again facing the politics of territorial expansionism.
The ultimate goal of the wars of aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ukraine is the same - territorial expansion.
That is why one of the messages from my country reads: ""Learn from Sarajevo - save Kiev""!
I believe that a just and lasting peace in Ukraine has no alternative.
Russia's aggression against Ukraine in the previous 28 months has caused terrible consequences.
After the beginning of the Russian aggression, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the positions of the European Union (EU) and firmly expressed its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
In international organizations, my country regularly joins statements, initiatives and decisions condemning Russian aggression.
The free world, among other things, has two important tasks:
First, to help the people of Ukraine to defend their country.
The second is not to allow Russia to start a new war on the European continent and thus divert attention from the aggression against Ukraine.
Let us not forget, these two tasks are related.
Therefore, I must warn that pro-Russian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina threaten peace.
The bodies of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entity of Republika Srpska, with the open support of Russia, threaten the Dayton Peace Agreement and threaten the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
Therefore, I call on the free world to help Ukraine even more strongly, but also to prevent the destabilization of the Western Balkans.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, from my personal experience, we know that achieving peace is a complicated and difficult process.
It requires a strong will, persistence, reason, and the engagement of a wider circle of actors. In this sense, I support the basic intention and objectives of this summit.
Europe and the world should strongly demonstrate that Ukraine is not alone in its struggle for freedom.
Solidarity with Ukraine is more important today than ever.
For Ukraine to win, solidarity must win over state egoism.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to express solidarity towards Ukraine.
We want the war in Ukraine to stop, a just peace achieved and hope restored for millions of people that they can live in peace.
Thank you for your attention."
101880,"Speech by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the Summit within the framework of the South",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101880&langTag=en-US,2024-06-13,"Dear Excellencies, Honorable President Gordana Siljanovska Davkova, allow me, before all, to congratulate you once again on the excellent organization of this summit and on your commitment to the regional cooperation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a peaceful country, committed to strengthening regional cooperation.
We want good relations with the countries in the region, based on mutual appreciation and respect. That is why we actively participate in a series of regional initiatives, with the aim of improving cooperation in the region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina considers accession to the Common Regional Market, within the framework of the Berlin process, particularly important. We are interested in the implementation of this initiative, because it helps the integration of our countries into the EU single market.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the door of the EU and NATO.
In March of this year, an important step towards the EU membership was made. The European Council made a decision on the opening of the EU negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a huge encouragement for the citizens of our country. I use this opportunity to express my gratitude to the EU and NATO for their commitment and support to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For the future of the region, it is very important that we work to affirm the truth and restore trust between countries.
The adoption of the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica represents a highly moral and civilized act of the United Nations General Assembly. The adopted Resolution is equally important for the UN as it is for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The highest courts of the UN (the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia) ruled that genocide was committed against Bosniaks in the UN safe zone of Srebrenica. So, the highest courts of the UN proved what happened in Srebrenica.
These are court verdicts that cannot be erased from the history of the UN and humanity.
The UN General Assembly supported the established legal facts and adopted the Resolution.
It is important that the entire region is committed to:
- strengthening the culture of peace and encouraging justice;
- turning to the future rather than the past;
- reconciliation process in the region;
- institutional protection of the heritage of the UN courts;
- condemnation of the policy of glorifying war criminals;
- prevention of genocide;
- affirmation of the culture of remembrance;
- dialogue and building an inclusive society;
- and educational systems that will be in the function of genocide prevention.
As the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I especially want to emphasize that there are no genocidal nations.
War criminals must not hide behind entire nations.
The resolution is a new chance for catharsis and a civilized settlement with those responsible for the committed genocide.
Regional cooperation has great potential and development opportunities.
We learn from the experience of Western countries. Those countries moved strongly forward after definitively giving up large-state projects.
Regional cooperation, based on the principles of mutual respect, continues to be an important framework for improving overall cooperation in the region.
Together we are building a safer and better future for Southeast Europe.
The common interests of all countries of the region are:"
101790,Address by BiH Presidency member Željko Komšić at the event marking the Day of the Municipality of Novi Grad Sarajevo and the Battle for the Žuč Hill,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101790&langTag=en-US,2024-06-08,"Dear All, First of all, I would like to thank you for the honour of addressing you today. It is not my intention to give speeches about the past, but I do intend to invite you all to silently and in our thoughts remember our war comrades who died defending everything worth giving their lives for - family, honour, their homeland.
This magnificent monument, at least that is how I perceive it, is above all a memory of them, it is at least an attempt to tell and show their loved ones and those closest to them that neither they, nor their sacrifice, have been forgotten.
This monument is a moral obligation of sorts of our entire generation, which had the misfortune to find itself in the war, but fulfilled its obligation to those closest to it, to its homeland, bravely and, what is very important, honourably!
For our fallen comrades, for our comrades who lost their health, for their families, for this monument, thank you to all those who contributed to us being here today, and on this very occasion.
It is not my intention to be pretentious, and especially to be pathetic, but it seems to me that for those of us who were lucky or thanks to God, remained alive and at least relatively healthy, it is somehow normal, natural, in places like this to think of our friends, comrades, and after so many years to tell them - we still miss you, you are still in our thoughts, we are still proud to have known you and eternally thank you for everything!
I already said that I will not talk about the past, it is as it is, it cannot be changed, but I would like to say something, very briefly, about our present and possibly about what could be expected in the future.
Who are we Bosnians and Herzegovinans today? Are we aware of the moment we live in, what is important to us today, do we know what we want and where we are going? These are the questions we should ask ourselves.
It is clear to us that the policies that brought about and carried out all the evil that befell us and hit us during the war, not that they did not disappear or die, but that they seem to be strengthening and tearing at this small and beautiful country of ours again. Tearing at this country with the same goals as those in the nineties of the last century were.
Maybe those who design and lead those policies think that today they have hidden their goals better and more cunningly, maybe they think that today they have even more powerful allies than then, maybe they think that we do not pay attention to what they are doing, maybe they think that they have a real moment for the final blow. It is possible that it is just like that!
But, a more difficult question, and especially the answer to that question, from which we sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously run away, is - what are we doing?! Are we even aware of it, are we aware of the world around us and everything that is happening, is everything that is happening important to us?
For example, one among many others, I wonder if we are aware that persecution of people has started again in Bosnia and Herzegovina because of opinions and expressing opinions, writing? Are we aware that the repressive apparatus of the state, our state, is beginning to be used for political persecution of people because of a different opinion, are we ready to turn a blind eye to it?
Are we ready to remain silent or to speak of it openly? Because, for God's sake, it doesn't happen to us, but to someone else, and then, when it is too late, we ""wake up"" when ""the knife is at our throats again"".
Are we ready today to distinguish between politics, dirty in itself, and betrayal of the country? Are we ready to distinguish between opportunism and conformity, and human honour, and even empathy? Or as people in Bosnia and Herzegovina would say - do we care about ""the cheek"" at least half as much as we do about personal interests?
Are we ready today to comply with various JCEs, large-state projects, are we ready to once again be the ""main dish on the menu"" of the evil that befell us at the end of the last century?
Those are nasty and difficult questions! And the answers are cruel and painful! And I have been wondering for some time whether it is good to say this, whether people in Bosnia and Herzegovina are ready to hear such questions, do they want to hear them? I especially wonder if we are ready to answer those questions?
And finally, are we ready to forget, only and exclusively because of our opportunism and conformity, because of our personal interests, all those who are not among us today and for whom we gathered today? And if we are, the least we can do is honestly remember that those, for whom we gathered here today, were not such people and did not calculate, did not surrender. They were ready to sacrifice everything for what they loved and cared about, more than their own lives! Of course, not every human being is a hero! That too is human! But ""burying your head in the sand"", not wanting to see even with your eyes wide open, is, to put it mildly, stupid and ultimately fatal!
If you think that this is pessimistic and that I am pessimistic, you are wrong. I'm not a pessimist at all, I'm just not ready to run away from the truth and yes, in the name of hypocrisy in the business I'm in, which today is called, in modern terms, ""being politically correct"", I'm not ready to lie either to myself or to you. I am afraid that this is our present, a present full of difficult questions. I have only superficially mentioned a couple of them. Unfortunately, there are more.
Our future will depend on our willingness to answer those questions, first of all to ourselves!
Dear friends, don't hold it against me!
And thank you!"
101649,Address of the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the adoption of the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of th,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101649&langTag=en-US,2024-05-24,"Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the country and abroad,
The General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted the Resolution on July 11 as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica.
Many thought that we would never see this Resolution in the UN. After a series of failed attempts, we succeeded. Behind this success is well thought out and dedicated work. This result did not fall from the sky. We invested enormous effort, knowledge and energy.
This is one of the most important diplomatic and political victories of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 21st century.
We were in a completely unequal position compared to the incomparably more numerous diplomatic missions of Serbia, Russia, North Korea and some other countries. However, in cooperation with our allies, we won.
Unfortunately, the adopted Resolution is little satisfaction for the families of the victims of genocide.
No resolution or court ruling can replace their suffering and pain. That is why even now we need to be dignified and careful in our statements.
We do not want to gloat and celebrate because of this huge diplomatic success. Today we want to remember with respect the victims of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes.
This Resolution is not directed against any nation. The resolution is a new chance for catharsis and a civilizational parting with the legally convicted war criminals.
Thank you to the friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina from all over the world who supported and helped to adopt this important Resolution. I would like to thank all the UN member states that voted for this resolution.
The result of the vote in the UN General Assembly is beyond our expectations, given that we know what kind of strong diplomatic machinery we have faced. 84 votes for, and only 19 against is a big and convincing victory. It is also important that the 68 abstentions do not negate the judgments of the UN courts. Many of the ambassadors of these countries told me that directly. And these countries will also mark July 11 as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica.
The invitation to vote against this Resolution was not accepted by 152 UN member states, plus some states that were not in the hall during the vote. That is the real truth. Namely, in the UN procedure, where votes for and against are counted, abstentions are always support for the majority, not the minority. If the abstaining countries wanted to harm or overturn the Resolution, they would have voted against it. But they did not do it knowingly. Almost all abstaining countries emphasized in the discussions that there was genocide in Srebrenica. Now we can ask why they abstained from voting after such discussions. Because they knew that the Resolution had enormous support in relation to the deniers of the adjudicated genocide, and they decided to give themselves some political room due to various geopolitical and geo-economic rather serious reasons. That is why we should not fall for propaganda that aims to make enemies out of countries with which we can cooperate in the future.
The text of the adopted Resolution refers to civilizational values that cannot be contested in democratic and civilized countries.
The text of the resolution, among other things, emphasizes:
- to declare July 11 as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, which will be marked every year and it will start from July 11 this year;
- to unreservedly condemn any denial of the genocide in Srebrenica;
- that appropriate programs are developed through educational systems, in order to prevent the recurrence of genocide in the future;
- to encourage the process of building sustainable peace, justice, truth and reconciliation.
I started the activities related to this Resolution at the beginning of the mandate, and intensified them exactly 12 months ago.
I sincerely thank the Mothers of Srebrenica and other associations of genocide victims who I informed about this project from the very beginning and who provided full support to this project.
We conducted this very demanding and complex process in a planned and designed manner and led to a concrete result. We didn't talk much, but we did work hard. It is one of the most complex projects that involved a huge number of activities. I held hundreds of meetings with ambassadors in the country and abroad, presidents, prime ministers, ministers, dozens of telephone conversations... There is almost no country in the world with which I did not establish some form of communication.
We have also demonstrated a new way of operating.
We have proven that serious politics is not conducted with empty words, but with systematic and serious work. We have shown that politics is not sensationalism and fighting for likes. And that is why, among other things, we succeeded.
As the man who initiated and led this project, I would like to especially praise the most prominent man of this project in the United Nations – Dr Zlatka Lagumdziju. Without his involvement and knowledge, this Resolution would hardly have been adopted. Dr Lagumdžija did a great job and I thank him for that. He made the best use of his indisputable diplomatic knowledge and skills, as well as numerous connections around the world.
On the occasion of the adoption of this Resolution, I would also like to thank:
- the mothers of Srebrenica, headed by Munira Subašić;
- Raisu-l-Ulama of the Islamic Community in BiH Dr Husein Kavazovic;
- my colleagues in the Cabinet, especially Dr Alija Kožljak;
- member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić;
- Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Elmedin Konaković;
- to the director of Memorial of Potočari, Dr Emir Suljagić;
- Association of Genocide Victims and Witnesses headed by Murat Tahirović;
- the ambassadors of Bosnia and Herzegovina who participated in this;
- and numerous other people in the homeland and diaspora.
I will not talk too much about my activities, let the witnesses of those activities talk about it. All of these mentioned people, as well as many others, were part of a great team, which achieved a great and historic result. I thank them most sincerely.
Apart from the serious machinery outside our country that worked against the adoption of this Resolution, domestic populists were also a big problem.
The Resolution was also talked about by politicians who have little to do with this Resolution. They created additional problems for us with their populist statements. Nevertheless, we brought this project to a successful conclusion and showed seriousness and responsibility.
I also want to send a few messages to the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Serb people are an integral part of the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina in diversity and an equal people with other peoples. That is how it has been and that is how it will stay.
The resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica is not a threat to the Serb people. There are no genocidal nations.
This Resolution should be understood as a great chance for catharsis and charting a path to a safer future.
I also wish to send a message to the citizens of the neighbouring Republic of Serbia.
Serbia is not mentioned in this resolution. I want us to develop good relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, with mutual appreciation and respect.
It is time for the president of Serbia to understand that he is the president of the Republic of Serbia, not the president of the Serbs. There are no presidents of Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats and other nations, there are internationally recognized states and legal authorities of those states. We should not invent Serbian, Bosniak and Croat parliaments, we should respect the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the National Assembly of Serbia and the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia. We do not need medieval logic, but respect for international law.
Inclusiveness, economic growth, regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration should be the direction of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the coming years.
I think we have the capacity and partners with whom we can achieve these goals.
Like never before, I am convinced that Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a country of successful people.
Finally, thank you once again to all the UN member states who voted for the Resolution and who preserve the truth about the Srebrenica genocide and give hope for a more just future."
101469,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the session of the United Nations Security Council in New York on the occasion of the High Representative's R",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101469&langTag=en-US,2024-05-15,"Mister President, First of all, I wish you a successful presidency of the United Nations (UN) Security Council in these turbulent times. I also welcome all distinguished ambassadors, as well as Mr. Christian Schmidt, High Representative of the International Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose report contributes to the overview of the current situation in our country.
I especially emphasize that the High Representative is the only one authorized to submit a report to the UN Security Council.
Entities and other, lower levels of government do not have that right within the sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why the so-called reports coming from Republika Srpska entity are legally unfounded. The UN Charter stipulates that states address UN organs and bodies. The only subject of international law is the independent and sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Esteemed President,
Allow me to present the key problems, challenges and dangers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as possible directions for overcoming the current crisis.
I am addressing you on behalf of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose millennial historical roots are strong and unbreakable.
In the last twenty-nine post-Dayton years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has once again confirmed its strength and resilience.
Despite numerous blockades, obstructions and pressures, the development of our country continued, showing both in war and in peace that the destruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not possible.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a full member of the UN, the Council of Europe and a country which is at the door of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
In March of this year, an important step towards membership in the European Union (EU) was made. The European Council made a decision to open EU negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a huge encouragement for the citizens of our country. I use this opportunity to express my gratitude to the EU and NATO for their commitment and support to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The world needs to know the truth. The key problems of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not arise in our country, but outside its borders.
This was determined by the highest courts of the UN. Last year, the Hague Tribunal defined the legal nature of the war waged against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its verdict against the leaders of the State Security of Serbia.
The final judgments of this UN court confirmed that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there was not a civil war but an international armed conflict.
These judgments of the UN courts are of great importance because they tell what the essential problem was and remains. These are attempts from outside to weaken and destroy our country. This is the essence of all the problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the last four decades.
In July this year, we are marking the 29th anniversary of the genocide committed against Bosniaks in and around Srebrenica.
It is a terrible reminder of the recent past of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also a warning that we must be careful. Verdicts on committed genocide were determined by the highest courts of the UN. That is a legal fact.
Unfortunately, the leaders of Republika Srpska entity do not respect the judgments of the UN courts. Moreover, they glorify convicted war criminals and say they want to continue the policy of war criminals. This can be understood as a threat of a new genocide.
It is important for humanity that the UN General Assembly adopts a resolution on the remembrance and commemoration of the genocide in Srebrenica in 1995.
This resolution is of great importance for spreading the truth and awareness about the committed genocide against Bosniaks. It is an important civilizational step forward in the fight for truth and justice.
The authorities of Republika Srpska entity do not respect the entirety of the Dayton Agreement and its annexes.
They selectively interpret the Dayton Agreement and undermine the independence, sovereignty and statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. With such an irresponsible policy, they threaten peace and stability.
The latest report of the High Representative highlights this.
A dangerous attack on the constitutional order and the Dayton Agreement is underway. The peace and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina is seriously threatened by the anti-Dayton policy of Republika Srpska entity. For years, they have been trying to use legal violence to change the fundamental provisions of the Dayton Agreement.
Two key institutions of the Dayton Agreement were openly attacked: the Office of the High Representative and the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The entity of Republika Srpska is trying to block these two institutions. They do not hide that they want to become the supreme interpreters of the Dayton Agreement. It is an attempt to unilaterally destroy this international agreement.
The international community has clearly defined obligations and responsibilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It has all the necessary instruments, including executive powers, to guarantee peace and stability. In the first post-Dayton decade, high representatives helped the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to live in peace with decisive and justified interventions. Those decisions did not threaten the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but preserved peace.
That is why it is essential to strengthen the institution of the High Representative.
The decisions of the High Representative must be implemented on the entire state territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This must be ensured de jure and de facto.
The authorities of Republika Srpska entity are advocating dangerous deceptions.
The first deception of the political leaders of Republika Srpska entity relates to sovereignty. There is no sovereignty of entities within a sovereign state, but only the sovereignty of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Allow me to underline, sovereignty is mentioned nine times in the Dayton Agreement and exclusively refers to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The second deception concerns the issue of continuity. This is precisely resolved in Article 1 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only Bosnia and Herzegovina has continuity. Entities in the country have only existed since the signing of the Dayton Agreement.
The third deception of the authorities of Republika Srpska entity relates to the issue of resolving constitutional disputes. They cannot be resolved by entities. The Constitution of BiH stipulates that this is the competence of the Constitutional Court of BiH and that its decisions are final and binding.
The fourth deception concerns the final interpretation of the Dayton Agreement. This was resolved by Annex 10 of the Dayton Agreement and that role was assigned to the High Representative.
The fifth deception refers to the anti-Dayton attempt to present neighbouring Serbia as a guarantor of the Dayton Agreement. Serbia is not the guarantor of this agreement, but one of the three parties.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a peaceful country, committed to strengthening regional cooperation.
We want good relations with our neighbours, based on mutual appreciation and respect. That is why we actively participate in a series of regional initiatives, with the aim of improving cooperation in the region.
Unfortunately, we have intense militarization in the neighbourhood. That is why I want to emphasize that it is very important to preserve the balance of military forces in the region, as determined by Annex 1-B of the Dayton Agreement.
For peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is important that the UN Security Council extends the mandate of the Althea mission in November 2024.
The presence of the EUFOR is important for the preservation of peace and stability. This particularly refers to the protection of returnees in Republika Srpska entity, who are exposed to numerous attacks.
The future of our country is connected with the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
The judgments order Bosnia and Herzegovina to change the entire political paradigm and harmonize it with democratic standards. Bosnia and Herzegovina is obliged to ensure the individual rights of citizens, not only the collective rights of the people..
It is particularly important to emphasize the legal fact that state property belongs to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Article 1 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina defines that the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the sole successor of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which includes the continuity of ownership of state property.
Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the owner of the property that belongs to it based on the Agreement on Succession Matters. This international multilateral agreement established the sovereign equality of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. According to the principle of pacta sunt servanda, all successor states, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, must respect and implement the agreement. Entities are not even mentioned in this international agreement.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's ownership of state property was confirmed by final and binding judgments of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina's argumentation is based on international and national law.
Let us not forget, one of the key demands of the then president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, in Dayton was to divide the state property between the entities.
Milošević did not achieve that goal in Dayton. Today, some politicians from Republika Srpska entity would like to get in peace what Milošević did not get during the aggression. The international community must not allow this.
In particular, we should warn about the danger of politics which advocates changing state borders in Southeast Europe.
The president of the entity Republika Srpska publicly advocates the unification with Serbia of the entity Republika Srpska and Montenegro. Thus, he directly calls for the destruction of several member states of the United Nations. It is a serious threat to European peace and the members of the UN.
Finally, on behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I sincerely thank the friends of our country.
We have not forgotten the help we received from many UN member countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina appreciates it and does not forget it.
That is why I invite you to preserve peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region together. I am convinced that this is in the interest of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and the UN.
Thank you for your attention!"

Address by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina member Željko Komšić:
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Goran, organizers of the exhibition...
It is a privilege, and certainly a pleasure, to open tonight's exhibition and to be part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of a great painter such as Mario Mikulić, from Sarajevo, not by place of birth, but by choice.
This event represents, not only an opportunity to remember his extraordinary contribution to art, but also to remember a great man, his interesting life that ""smells"" irresistibly of Sarajevo.
You, his family, and us with you, both can be proud of everything he did during his lifetime, and of the legacy he left to Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This exhibition is precisely the opportunity to become a part of his world through his masterpieces, to explore the different phases of his creativity and to enrich ourselves with his work and art. Watching his paintings tonight is not only an aesthetic pleasure, but also a deep reflection of the human spirit and emotions.
I congratulate the organizers of the exhibition, which gives us a glimpse into the distant past, but at the same time gives us an insight into universal themes that are still relevant in Bosnian society today.
I thank Goran, not only for this exhibition, but for everything he does, sometimes painstakingly, for culture in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the end of the day, this exhibition is not only a memory of his father, this is a precious gift of both Mario and Goran Mikulić to Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Right at the beginning, I would like to congratulate all of you on the Day of the Municipality of Stari Grad. I congratulate in advance all the winners of the awards that will be presented today, both to collectives and to individuals for their general contribution, not only to the municipality of Stari Grad, but also to the whole of Sarajevo, and to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The municipality of Stari Grad, historically and symbolically, is one of the most prominent municipalities in our city, because it is in this area that our capital was founded.
For centuries, this part of the city symbolized, in a certain way, the center of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is evidenced by this space where today's event is held. In other words, the area of ​​Gazi Husrev Bey's endowment, which again has existed for centuries as one of the spiritual and educational centers of Sarajevo.
Today, the Old Town, if not always, then certainly often, is the first image about us, the image of the City of Sarajevo that goes to the world through the photos of numerous tourists visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Therefore, the responsibility of the people who lead the Municipality of Stari Grad is of particular importance, and I am convinced that they are aware of this responsibility.
This is especially important when it is known that we live in a time where there is no room for repeating someone's mistakes and when those in power are expected to offer citizens and the state something new and better.
In this regard, I am encouraged by the projects implemented by the Municipality of Stari Grad with the aim of improving the overall status and reputation of the municipality, and I hope that a positive energy will be maintained in the future.
Finally, given that the 2nd of May is celebrated as the day of the Municipality of Stari Grad, and we all know what happened 32 years ago on that day and in the days that followed, we are obliged to remember all the fallen fighters and martyrs who laid down their lives for the freedom of this city and for the beauty that we enjoy in peace today.
Eternal glory and thanks be to them, and once again I congratulate all of you on the Day of the Municipality of Stari Grad!"
101101,"Address by Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Denis Bećirović at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, on the occasion of the resolution on the International Day of Rem",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101101&langTag=en-US,2024-04-19,"Dear ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for your time and the opportunity to point out important facts that are significant, not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for all of humanity.
Allow me to briefly state the context, reasons and significance of the adoption of the resolution on July 11 as an International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the g=Genocide in Srebrenica, committed in 1995.
The final judgments of the highest UN courts (the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia) confirmed that genocide was committed against Bosniaks in the UN safe zone of Srebrenica.
These are court judgments that cannot be erased from the history of mankind. The highest UN courts proved what happened in Srebrenica in 1995.
No genocide after the Second World War has been documented in such detail as the genocide in Srebrenica.
I would like to remind you that the Hague Tribunal left behind a huge archive of the genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes.
Among other things, the legacy of The Hague consists of:
· 2.5 million transcripts of court proceedings;
· 422,000 documents;
· 30,000 videos.
10,800 trial days were held at the Hague Tribunal, and over 4,600 witnesses testified. In total, almost 1,500 years of imprisonment were imposed. The tribunal did not judge nations, but determined individual responsibility.
Former UN Secretary General and Nobel Peace Prize winner Kofi Annan wrote in his 2000 report on the fall of Srebrenica that the UN made a ""mistake in Srebrenica by miscalculating and failing to recognize the extent of the evil they were facing.""
He also said that what happened in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda is a shame for the UN, because these terrible crimes happened right in front of the UN troops.
The United Nations made a mistake in 1995, but they must not make another mistake in 2024. Genocide victims and their families deserve even a small piece of justice.
The proposed text of the resolution on July 11, as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica committed in 1995, refers to civilizational values.
Among other things, the text of the resolution emphasizes:
to declare July 11 as the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, which will be marked every year;
· to unreservedly condemn any denial of the genocide in Srebrenica and call on the member states to preserve the established facts;
· that it is necessary, through educational systems, to develop appropriate programs, also as a mark of remembrance and with the aim of preventing revisionism and genocide in the future;
· that glorification of persons convicted of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide should be unreservedly condemned, including those responsible for the genocide in Srebrenica;
· to establish appropriate education and activities to raise public awareness of the committed genocide.
What are the key objectives of this resolution? I will list, among others, nine key arguments for its adoption:
1. Strengthening the culture of peace and encouraging justice
The fundamental goal of this resolution is to build sustainable peace, and encourage the process of justice, truth and trust in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans region.
The process of reconciliation must consist of the overall recovery of society, recognition of genocide and crimes, acknowledgement of victims, and punishment of criminals, but with a focus on an outcome that would promote peace and justice.
2. Turning to the future, not the past
We cannot change the past, but we can influence the future.
The aim of this resolution is not to rewrite the past, as that is simply impossible. The purpose of this resolution is to emphasize the importance of building a safer future for new generations.
3. The resolution serves the purpose of reconciliation in the Western Balkans region
The adoption of this resolution would undoubtedly help and encourage the reconciliation process in the long run, within Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in the region as a whole.
4. Institutional protection of the heritage of the UN courts
Institutional protection of the heritage of UN tribunals and courts simultaneously protects civilizational values and the fundamental principles on which the UN rests, but also contributes to ensuring that the crime of genocide is never repeated.
For the sake of the future work of the UN and the preservation of the credibility of this most important international organization, it is extremely important to learn from the failure of the UN to prevent the genocide in Srebrenica.
5. An important message and warning to mankind
By adopting this resolution, we would send an important message to humanity. The United Nations should be reminded of the final verdicts of its courts on the genocides committed in Rwanda and Srebrenica, because they should serve as a constant warning to humanity.
It is, therefore, necessary for the UN General Assembly to adopt a resolution on the International Day of Remembrance and Commemoration of the Genocide in Srebrenica, as it
did in the Resolution on the International Day of Remembrance of the Genocide in Rwanda against the Tutsi.
Rwanda and Srebrenica must never be erased from the collective memory of humanity.
6. Solidarity with victims, conviction of criminals and prevention of genocide denial
By denying the genocide committed in and around Srebrenica, as well as by glorifying legally convicted war criminals, the surviving witnesses of the genocide are exposed to attacks on their dignity every day.
By adopting this resolution, we would support the families of genocide victims in their fight for truth and justice.
7. Affirmation of the culture of remembrance
Cultivating the culture of remembrance should serve the purpose of stimulating the process of critically confronting the past.
By critically dealing with the past, we want to emphasize the importance of preserving the human rights and freedoms of each individual, and encourage empathy towards the victims of genocide. That is why this resolution is extremely important.
The culture of remembering the victims of the genocide in Srebrenica is not and must not be a culture of denial, but a culture of remembrance, so that the genocide is never repeated.
8. The resolution serves the purpose of dialogue and building an inclusive society
Public education, along with encouraging critical reflection and public dialogue, is the fundamental basis for building socially conscious citizens, ready to oppose ideologies and policies that lead to genocide.
With the resolution, we want to contribute to the construction of an inclusive society based on civilizational values.
9. The resolution has global significance because it encourages educational systems to be in the function of genocide prevention
The resolution should encourage UN member states to adopt teaching and educational programs based on which future generations will be educated about the prevention and consequences of genocide.
The adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution is an important civilizational step forward in the fight for truth and justice.
We are convinced that this resolution is as important for all of us together, for the world, as it is for Bosnia and Herzegovina, because it unequivocally expresses, on a global level, the condemnation of genocide, support for the victims, prevention of denial of genocide and willingness to work together to prevent genocide.
As the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I especially want to point out important legal arguments, because this resolution is based on international and national law.
In that respect, I emphasize the following legal facts:
·Bosnia and Herzegovina is a full member of the UN and it is our obligation to respect and implement legally binding judgments of permanent and ad hoc established courts (and tribunals) of the UN;
· The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Agreement) was signed in 1995. In Article 9 of this agreement, the parties undertook to respect their obligations and cooperate ""in the investigation and prosecution of war criminals and other violations of international humanitarian law"";
· In the preamble of the BiH Constitution, which is an integral part of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the determination of the contracting parties to ensure ""full respect of international humanitarian law"" is expressly emphasized, which, among other things, implies the implementation of legally binding court rulings;
· In the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Article II. 8. it is also a standardized obligation of all relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and any other international organization authorized by the UN Security Council, with a mandate concerning human rights or humanitarian law;
· The Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina prohibits public approval, denial or justification of the crime of genocide. Therefore, any action contrary to the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a criminal offense in Bosnia and Herzegovina;
· Finally, I would like to remind you of the extremely important provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties from 1969, according to which concluded international agreements must be respected and executed in good faith. Bosnia and Herzegovina has undertaken obligations to act in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter, as well as numerous other international agreements, relevant to the adoption and implementation of the resolution in question.
It is very important that we break the false propaganda that tries to present this resolution as an attack on a nation.
Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats and Others, as well as all citizens of our country, are an integral part of Bosnian-Herzegovinian unity in diversity. That's how it was and that's how it will remain.
The resolution on the genocide in Srebrenica is not a threat to the Serbian people. There are no genocidal nations. There are criminals who are responsible for genocide.
There is not a single sentence in this resolution that talks about the collective responsibility of a nation. It is a truth that must be spoken publicly.
There is no justifiable reason for any country in the world not to support the proposed resolution on Srebrenica in the UN General Assembly.
I call on those who are lobbying against the adoption of this resolution to stop doing so and to support the adoption of this resolution.
The genocide in Srebrenica, in the heart of Europe, must not be forgotten or denied.
We must not allow this for the sake of the future of humanity.
By remembering, we preserve the dignity of the victims.
With memory, we fight for a safe future for new generations.
This is a big test for the United Nations as well.
This is also a question of protecting the credibility of this highest international organization, whose highest courts have already passed the final verdicts on the genocide in Srebrenica.
I hope that UN members will protect international law and send a global message that there is hope for a more just future for humanity.
Thank you for your attention."
101146,Address by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina member Željko Komšić at the UN regarding the consideration of the resolution on Srebrenica at the UN General Assembly scheduled for May 2,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=101146&langTag=en-US,2024-04-19,"""If you look in detail, and even superficially, at the text of this resolution, even the most malicious person will not be able to find the argument that we see circulating in the media, which is that this resolution is directed against any country, people and nations. It does not exist in the text of this resolution. Only the malicious can extract such messages.
This resolution tries to prevent and stop the denial of the facts established by international courts, namely that the genocide was committed in Srebrenica.
Another thing worth taking out of the resolution as a universal message is commitment to the future. Dedication to our children, to the generations that come after us, which I hope will be better than us. That future generations know what happened, that they can draw the right conclusions that will not be burdened with hatred towards anyone. Denying genocide, denying that evil and accepting that denial is actually sowing new seeds of evil for a new genocide.
What I have heard in recent days in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the countries of the Western Balkans, and even here in New York from those who attack and criticize the resolution, is, in fact, the denial and negation of the genocide in Srebrenica.
We can wrap it in any kind of cellophane, but under that cover is the fact that refusing to support the resolution is denying the genocide in Srebrenica, despite the international courts!
Does this mean that not accepting the fact that genocide was committed in Srebrenica means that we are ready to accept some new genocides and the results of genocide? I hope we are aware of that. Only the truth is healing, a lie does not help, only the truth heals. The harsh truth, whether someone likes it or not, is that genocide was committed in Srebrenica! These people were systematically killed because of their religion and ethnicity.
I thank all of you for your support and for listening to us these days, and I hope that the resolution will receive support at the UN General Assembly.
I thank all those who have so far expressed their public support for this act, not as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but as a Bosnian and Herzegovinian and on behalf of my child""."
100742,"Address by the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the adoption of the decision of the European Council on the opening of negotiations of the European Union with Bosnia a",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100742&langTag=en-US,2024-03-22,"Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the country and abroad, The European Council adopted the Decision on the opening of negotiations between the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After a long time, we made it!
This victory belongs to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina won.
The European Union won.
The future won.
The work and effort paid off.
At this moment, there is no room for celebration and euphoria of politicians because we all have to prepare for the huge work that follows.
Before us is the process of transformation of the state in which the legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to be harmonized with the acquis of the EU.
This is one of the most important moments for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 21st century. We brought the country closer to the EU and strengthened the foreign policy position of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a full member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and a country that is at the door of NATO.
As of today, we are a country that is officially entering the final phase of integration into the EU, with which we are opening negotiations on full membership.
Thank you to everyone who contributed to making today's decision of the European Council a positive one.
First of all, I would like to thank the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Without their patience and support we could not have achieved this result.
Thanks to our friends in the EU, especially the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the European Council, Charles Michel.
We also had enormous support from the head of the EU Delegation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Johann Sattler, and his associates.
I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
An important contribution was provided by the media, as well as representatives of civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina have common interests and aspirations. The multicultural EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina are inseparably connected and complementary.
Just as Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to economic, legal, political, security and other reasons, decided to be a part of the EU, I believe that for the EU, for geopolitical and other reasons, it is important to dynamize the process of integration of the countries of the Western Balkans.
The potential of the EU membership provides a significant incentive for changes within Bosnia and Herzegovina that are necessary for:
§ strengthening of BiH economy and attracting investments,
§ building a true democratic society,
§ strengthening the rule of law,
§ promoting media freedom,
§ creating an appropriate climate for the strengthening of civil society.
The opening of negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina represents the demonstration of the ability and strength of the EU to be an effective community, based on the values of unity in diversity.
For the sake of peace and stability in this part of Europe, it is necessary to introduce zero tolerance towards individuals who threaten the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not exist for certain individuals to weaken our country. The movement towards the EU membership must be in the function of building a modern, European and functional state. The opening of negotiations with the EU should mark the end of anti-Dayton and separatist politics.
It is also in the EU's interest to support civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our country in Europe can only be what Europe is, a civil society in which ethnic, religious and other rights are part of the overall set of human rights.
The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains the European Convention on Human Rights, which is an integral part of our constitutional system. According to the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this convention and its protocols are directly applicable in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has priority over any other law.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is no more room for anti-European, irrational, discriminatory and asymmetric solutions. Our country needs a true and consistent implementation of European principles and democratic standards.
What awaits us after the opening of negotiations?
After the European Council adopted the Decision on the opening of negotiations, the following steps are ahead of us:
- The EU adopts the negotiation framework;
- Beginning of negotiations - First intergovernmental conference between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU;
- Screening - explanatory bilateral reports;
- Preparation of positions in the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Adoption of positions in the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- Opening of negotiations in clusters (6 clusters);
- Conducting negotiations and temporarily closing negotiations in chapters (33 chapters);
- EU decision on temporary closure of negotiations and preparation of the draft accession agreement;
- Signing and ratification of the EU accession agreement.
It is about over 120,000 documents and more than a million pages of text.
We have a huge work ahead of us to harmonize our legal system with the EU acquis.
The process of legal harmonization implies that the legal regulations of our country are harmonized with the legal regulations of the EU, that is, with the legal acquis - a set of rights and obligations that binds the EU members.
This process of harmonizing regulations with the EU regulations is a continuous and permanent process that implies constant monitoring of changes and harmonization of domestic regulations with the EU acquis.
To conclude, we have opened the front gate of the EU courtyard.
We are expected to arrange our house Bosnia and Herzegovina in the same way as 27 other houses in the common European yard.
So, before us is the work of tidying up, adjusting and harmonizing.
The result should be a democratic, legal and economically developed Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A country that serves people.
A country of arrival, not the country of departure.
Thank you for your attention!"
100678,"Address by Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović on the panel entitled ""On War and Peace: The Return of ""Realpolitik"""" at the Global Baku Forum in Azerbaijan",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100678&langTag=en-US,2024-03-14,"Esteemed Excellencies, Dear Friends, Let me first, and once again, thank our hosts for the invitation and the opportunity to address this distinguished gathering. I am honoured to share my insights on this highly significant matter.
There are many elements we need to take into consideration as we explore the theme of the panel. The first one implies the theory of the return of Realpolitik to international relations and global security.
Here we have to bear in mind that Realpolitik, by definition, views international relations primarily through the lens of hard power, predominantly military, and subsequently economic strength.
It is seen as a fundamental instrument for attaining projected interests and goals, offering a rather bare worldview stripped of deeper value elements, except those associated with preserving stability and the power of the state itself.
Despite the fact that some new developments such as, for instance, the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza or the new geopolitical circumstances, warn us, as suggested by the title of this panel, of the ‘return’ of Realpolitik, I believe that Realpolitik and its fundamental categories are constantly present in international political or security arena, where only the intensity of their manifestation varies from phase to phase in specific historical epochs.
And we, who come from the Western Balkan countries, which not too long ago witnessed war and destruction, and who still live with a high-level interference and involvement of certain foreign actors in our domestic issues, are always aware that it takes very little for ‘Realpolitik’ to reveal its ugliest face, where force and power become the sole tool in political processes and relations.
This leads us to another, also relevant issue, which is to understand the circumstances in which Realpolitik manifests as the dominant behavioural matrix but also to understand where our shared responsibility lies when it comes to the current state of affairs in international relations.
It is obvious that Realpolitik and its essence come to the forefront primarily when the key instruments, designed to cushion the impulses originating from the categories of force and power in international relations, fail.
Unfortunately, what we can see nowadays is a complete functional atrophy of multilateral international structures. In other words, their failure in fulfilling their main mission is so evident that we almost do not believe any more in their capacity to bridge the gaps and help the opposed sides to reach agreements or to assist the global community in identifying a common denominator on all relevant or burdening issues in international relations.
We also live in a world marked by profound distrust among key global actors, their direct struggle for more and more power, deep divisions, and ‘taking sides’ in conflicts and inter-state relations that could and should have been avoided.
Therefore, responsibility for the current state of international relations lies with all of us, primarily those who, with their capacities and resources, predominantly shape not only the current global environment but also our near and distant global future.
Those who believe that Realpolitik instruments represent the right way to achieve proclaimed interests and goals neglect the fact that Realpolitik, by its nature, is not only destructive but also self-destructive and that it cannot bring stability and prosperity in the long run.
I am convinced that it is high time for all of us to ‘wake up’ and to start thinking in a serious and responsible manner of how to revive the collapsing international structures, starting from the UN, and how to adapt them to the new circumstances and expectations of those who genuinely promote peace and stability.
Of course, it would sound too ambitions to say that we expect or demand from the big players to reduce their appetites and ambitions but we can still insist on all of us being gathered in an effort to renew mutual trust and to ensure common ‘rules of the game’ that everyone would equally respect, regardless of their strength and power.
Esteemed Excellencies,
Paradoxically, despite the overall civilizational, technological, scientific, and social development, today's world is facing the most complex security challenges in its history.
In a globalised world based on integration and interdependence, each and every one of us will suffer the consequences of our negative individual or collective choices and behaviours.
Therefore, with a certain concern for future developments, we should appeal to all, especially to key players on the international scene, to replace Realpolitik instruments with a negotiating process and diplomatic means.
Otherwise, the world will end up in deeper divisions and uncertainties and I am confident that this is what we want to avoid and that this forum firmly stands for a just and a more peaceful world.
Thank you."
100440,"Address by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100440&langTag=en-US,2024-02-28,"Distinguished excellencies, eminences, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, At the beginning of my address, I express my particular gratitude to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who, in a legal and internationally recognized referendum, decided that our country should be independent, sovereign and united, as well as to the anti-fascists of the last century who restored statehood and defended the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The long and glorious past of our country is behind us.
Let us be proud of the first 1075 years since the country of Bosnia was mentioned in historical sources. After this millennial journey, we cannot go back.
We just have to move forward. Before us is the Euro-Atlantic and European future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Deviating from that path would have fatal consequences.
Therefore, I consistently and everywhere insist on the implementation of the adopted strategic foreign policy goals. I do not do it by accident. This is how we protect the safety of our people and country in the best way!
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a full member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and a country that is at the door of the EU and NATO.
These are indisputable facts of international law that separatists must be aware of. Likewise, they must finally understand that the entities have never had and will never have international subjectivity.
According to the provisions of international and national law, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a state. Its constitutive elements are state territory, population and sovereign power. They are contained in the term ""state"", the term used to define Bosnia and Herzegovina in the international and national order.
Those who thought they could, in spite of all democratic principles, create a state within the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina ended up as legally convicted criminals, most of them are still in prison or have left this world branded.
This is how it will end for all those who eventually try to walk again in the paths of convicted war criminals.
Public holidays are an opportunity to initiate concrete steps aimed at strengthening the statehood and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Tonight is an opportunity for me to initiate two specific proposals. First, as there is a Bosnian Language House in Tuzla, I suggest that we open Bosnian language houses in every municipality or city, wherever possible.
Secondly, let us follow the positive example from Cazin, where the Museum of the Bosnian Kingdom was opened. I suggest that in every municipality or city, where possible, we open museums dedicated to the Bosnian and Bosnian and Herzegovinian state.
Let us do everything in our power to make our country stronger and safer.
We tell well-intentioned people that together we should protect Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We tell the malicious ones who have not given up on the illusory large-state projects that they will have an impenetrable wall in us.
So, with friends amicably, with enemies as they deserve.
Why do separatist-oriented politicians mind the presence of the international community in our country?
Why are they against foreigners in the Commission for National Monuments appointed by the Director General of UNESCO? Why are they against the judges of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina appointed by the President of the European Court of Human Rights? Why are they against the institution of the High Representative of the International Community? Why are they attacking the ambassadors of Western and other countries who respect Bosnia and Herzegovina?
Nothing is accidental. Those who advocate it have dangerous intentions towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not true that the presence of foreigners bothers the leaders of BiH's entity of RS. The truth is that they wish to strengthen the influence of Russia and weaken the influence of the West and the free democratic world.
That is why the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entity of RS said that ""the whole world needs Putin's humane approach"", in order to ""restrain the freakish liberal West and the EU, which has fallen into cultural regression"".
There is no dilemma, the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entity of RS are working according to the instructions of Moscow and their common goal is to remove the Euro-Atlantic influence from Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to block everything that leads our country towards a functional liberal democracy.
What would happen if the international community withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina?
We all know the answer, the same policies would attack Bosnia and Herzegovina, and again threaten the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
That is why we must openly and argumentatively expose this hypocritical and dangerous policy.
We must use arguments to break falsehoods and hoaxes.
We became a candidate country for the EU membership in December 2022. Soon we expect the opening of negotiations with the EU on full EU membership. We are in the heart of Europe and our place is in the EU.
We are also at the door of membership in NATO. This is our national legal, strategic and political commitment. We have a full consensus on NATO and it has been reached in the competent state bodies. That consensus can only be changed where it has been established and unanimously voted for. So, in competent state bodies, not in non-competent entity bodies.
NATO is a safe haven that guarantees peace, security and economic development to all people in our country.
Finally, I would like to emphasize that there is no more important issue than the issue of preserving the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let us work for the benefit of the country and people and protect the country and people.
Let loyalty and devotion to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina be the first.
Happy Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
100265,"Address by the Chairman of BiH Presidency Željko Komšić at the International Conference entitled ""Members of Parliament and Religious Leaders for Peace and Coexistence""",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100265&langTag=en-US,2024-02-12,"Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, members of parliament, respected organizers of the Conference!
I wish you a warm welcome on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and personally, and I welcome guests from abroad to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sarajevo.
I am glad to have the opportunity to open today's International Conference ""Members of Parliament and Religious Leaders for Peace and Coexistence"", and to discuss the topic of peace and life (I prefer this word and term to the word coexistence) here in the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially since I think that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina have something to say about that topic, regardless of the angle from which anyone looked at it.
The question of life and peace or living in peace, current even today, is the main question that was posed to us as a society after the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995.
Given that it was also a peace agreement, the maintenance of the entire constitutional and social structure within Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was established through difficult compromises, depended on the state of peace.
Peace was therefore at the centre of what, after the aggression and the bloody war, was our general, that is, common interest. Numerous security and other challenges, including tensions in this post-Dayton period of Bosnia and Herzegovina's history, could not overcome the basic civil need for peace and stability.
That basic civil need for peace won a sort of victory in the Bosnian society and enabled, at least partially, social integration, not only in the institutional, but also in the economic, cultural and sports sense.
Although Bosnia and Herzegovina remained administratively divided into entities, cantons and districts, the movement of people, goods and capital could not be stopped, just as numerous other encounters in different social disciplines could not be stopped. Peace gained meaning every day and it was increasingly clear that it was the greatest value of a political agreement with which, let us be honest, no one was satisfied.
For the peace, of course, we can thank ourselves as citizens, and we can also thank our friends from the international community who, wholeheartedly, made a solid contribution to its maintenance.
All this, in almost three decades of post-Dayton history, created the preconditions for a stable state of life in peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which I am convinced can turn into a permanent peace if Bosnia and Herzegovina is not threatened from the outside, as it is has been the case so far. The perspective of permanent peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina depends exclusively on this, because unrest and conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina did not arise by themselves, but were always and as a rule initiated and brought about from outside.
The state of peaceful life in Bosnia and Herzegovina is most visible right here, in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although it has not yet healed all wounds, and the question is whether this is even possible, the fact is that Sarajevo can be considered one of the freest and most liberal cities, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the entire Western Balkans.
By its character and nature, Sarajevo has always been like that! In Sarajevo, it is considered quite normal, almost natural, that people from all over Bosnia and Herzegovina, people of all ethnic and religious identities, live, work, cooperate, hang out, and more than that. It is simply our way of life and we see it as normality, not some spectacular fact and something new.
No matter how hard some political actors try to emphasize the existence of administrative lines, practical life testifies to the fact that people rely on each other in their daily activities. This speaks in the best way in favour of a pleasant and peaceful life. This, if nothing else, is evidenced by the thousands of people from all over Bosnia and Herzegovina who come to work in Sarajevo every day and work in peace and harmony with their colleagues, as well as by the many people who leave Sarajevo for other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The image of life and the perspective of lasting peace can be especially strengthened by religious communities and their leaders. I am saying this for a reason that is well known to all of us, whether some like it or not, the role of religious communities and religious leaders in our country is, after all, the role of spiritual and generally moral authority for a good part of Bosnians and Herzegovinians. This makes the role more important, but the responsibility is also greater!
I would like to hear religious officials talk more often about peace, living in peace and cooperation, as the actor Aleksandar Stojković spoke in response to the accusations, and in connection with the hosting of the Sarajevo War Theatre in Banja Luka.
I will end my address with his words because they are for me, without being pretentious and declaring them important for everyone, one of the most important thoughts that were expressed after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I quote:
""Do you think that I, Aleksandar Stojković, a soldier of the Republika Srpska army and a disabled war veteran, should be banned from participating in any festival in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina because I was a member of the Republika Srpska army, lost my best friends and lost hometown, lost the most beautiful youth ... that I need someone to justify myself because we invited our colleagues to come and do a play here, 30 years after the war. The two governments, the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Government of Republika Srpska, met together the other day, did anyone ask them that question? Maybe there was a Golden Lily there, maybe there was someone who wounded me in 1992, so what? Should I live in that world? Should I say to my son Marko: 'Don't cross over to Sanski Most even by accident, should I do that?'"", end of quote.
Thank you for your attention. I wish everyone successful work and the Conference."
100251,"Address by the Chairman of BiH Presidency, Željko Komšić, at the Central Ceremony at the National Theatre in Sarajevo on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the XIV Winter Olympic Games in Sarajev",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100251&langTag=en-US,2024-02-08,"Your Excellencies, Dear friends, Ladies and Gentlemen… welcome to Olympic Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I want to start by thanking all the athletes for their presence here tonight, especially those who participated in the competitions within the Olympic Games in Sarajevo. I am particularly pleased with the fact that the president of the friendly Republic of Slovenia is with us tonight, whom I hereby greet and once again welcome to Sarajevo. Welcome to Sarajevo, which exactly 40 years ago, according to the then president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaran, organized the best Winter Olympic Games until then.
Why were these, until then, the best organized games? There are many answers to this question, and many of us may have different answers to it, but I would venture to say that the main reason it was the best organized Winter Olympics was that we were among the best organized societies in the world at the time, no matter how it sounds to someone today.
Without any unnecessary pathos and excessive nostalgia for the times that have passed, which always and almost as a rule seem beautiful even when they are not, let alone when they are; I claim that the Bosnian society of that time was in every sense at its zenith, that is, at the peak of its creative, work and moral potential.
When I say that, I also feel a kind of deep gratitude towards the generation of people who dared to engage in the project of organizing the Winter Olympic Games. Gratitude not only to the people who had a clear vision of the importance of the Olympic Games for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sarajevo, but also to a working generation of people who, in their enthusiasm and faith, for the general and common good, were ready to take and contribute from their own income in order to present ourselves to the world in the best light.
That generation succeeded in this and thus proved to themselves and others that the decades of work and effort that had preceded it were not in vain. Bosnia and Herzegovina has gone from a small and underdeveloped Republic to a Republic that is able to organize events at the highest level, a journey from the backwoods to the centre of the world.
Of course, neither Sarajevo nor Bosnia and Herzegovina were alone in this. And that is why I want to thank all those from the former Yugoslavia, from Triglav to Vardar, who helped organize the Olympic Games in Sarajevo, and those who participated in the organization and maintenance of them. Without their contribution, the organization itself would not be the same and at such a high level. The Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo, in addition to everything else in terms of organization and sport, are also a triumph of the spirit. It was the victory of our common idea that we can be the best at anything that we accept with true enthusiasm and passion.
The feeling of collective pride that permeated us in those days left a deep mark on all of us who were witnesses of that time and those events.
We were proud because the world came to us and proud that we are the world, that is, our better side that lives on the principles of humanism, solidarity, friendship and equality.
Unfortunately, just when we believed that only the sky was our limit, it was as if all the hatred of the world fell on this city and country, and within a few years what had been built for decades disappeared and was burned. The aggressor against our country destroyed during the war all the Olympic stadiums and competition grounds, and worst of all, wounded the soul of this City, from which we are still recovering today, with more or less success.
The organization of the 2019 Youth Olympic Festival brought back hope and reminded of the days of the Winter Olympics, and it is also one of the most beautiful events in recent years.
That event leads us to think about the underutilization of our potential, but at the same time it represents the possibility that a new generation of our people will set before themselves the challenge of organizing the Winter Olympic Games, and once again make what is apparently difficult, complicated and demanding a part of our reality. I believe that those who are just entering sports and other fields today can succeed in this.
Thank you for your attention."
100013,"Speech by the Serb member of the BiH Presidency, Željka Cvijanović, at the 19th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=100013&langTag=en-US,2024-01-19,"Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour for me, as a representative of the observer country, to address this esteemed assembly at the 19th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. It is a true privilege for me to be in Kampala and Uganda for the first time, rightfully acclaimed as the pearl of Africa.
This gathering provides a unique opportunity to forge new partnerships, strengthen cooperation, and engage in discussions about the most important global issues.
I am confident that this conference will contribute significantly to enhancing bilateral and multilateral cooperation, fostering a deeper understanding of global processes, and addressing prevailing challenges.
Though originating from an observer nation rather than a full member, I hold the principles of non-alignment and the Movement itself in high regard.
This sentiment is partly rooted in the fact that my home country, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where I was born and spent a significant part of my life, was one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement, with its capital, Belgrade, hosting the inaugural conference in 1961.
The policy of non-alignment has obviously endured the test of time and its principles and values are needed today just as they were 60 years ago.
Regrettably, it appears that the lessons of the past have not been fully embraced. The language of force, weapons, and conflict continues to overshadow the language of peace, dialogue, and diplomacy.
Striking similarities exist between the perilous Cold War era and the current state of global affairs, where fires are extinguished with gasoline rather than rational discourse and diplomatic efforts.
Just as in the past, the dominance of power over international law persists, with the latter holding significance for the big powers only when it aligns with their interests.
Otherwise, international law remains a mere symbol on paper - an unrealised beacon of justice for the small who always suffer when their interests do not overlap with those of the big and powerful.
But we all know that rules will be effective only if they are universal - collectively and individually accepted by all relevant actors.
If the international law is selectively respected or adhered to and if standards vary from case to case, the result is a breeding ground for double standards and a perilous descent into chaos and disorder.
The consequence of the breakdown of the global order based on international law is instability and anarchy, where, in the long run, no one emerges victorious, and all, to varying degrees, suffer losses.
Regrettably, we observe this scenario in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has become a victim of contemporary neocolonialism and a laboratory for various political experiments, causing a destructive impact on all its peoples and citizens.
It is crucial to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina bears the disreputable label of being the ‘sole colony in Europe’ where a German national Christian Schmidt, disregarding the procedures of the international law, assumes the role of a high representative, behaving akin to a colonial governor from the 19th century.
Unlike former high representatives appointed in adherence to proper procedures and confirmed by the United Nations Security Council, Schmidt lacks UNSC confirmation, making his formal election to this position non-existent.
His unlawful presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina relies exclusively on force and the influence of powerful Western nations that back him, disregarding the fact that his appointment does not align with the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Still, this individual enforces laws in lieu of democratically elected domestic institutions and confronts democratically elected local representatives, seeking to politically eliminate those who oppose his arbitrary rule.
In front of the the eyes of the world, through his illegal actions, Christian Schmidt directly undermines the Dayton Peace Agreement, the rule of law, sovereignty, and the institutional and democratic capacity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As one of the three members of the collective Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I strongly believe that the fate of peoples should be determined through domestic institutions, not by self-proclaimed protectors, ambassadors, or any foreign entities.
The will of any individual or the stroke of a pen, regardless of its origin, should never override the collective will of the people. Unfortunately, what we see in BiH is that certain foreign actors promote the concept where the will of an individual should prevail over the collective will of our institutions.
I firmly assert that all political challenges, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and across the globe, should be resolved through peaceful and civilised means - through compromise and dialogue - rather than by force or the unilateral imposition of solutions.
The scenes of war, violence, and destruction in Eastern Europe or the Middle East deeply affect me, as I recognise the pain, suffering, and personal and familial tragedies that accompany every armed conflict.
The tragic conflict that the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced, the consequences we still feel nearly 30 years after its conclusion, obligates us to approach global conflicts not from a partisan perspective but exclusively from a human and humanitarian standpoint.
It urges us to consistently emphasise, on every occasion, the paramount importance of peace, understanding that it is better to negotiate for a thousand days than to engage in war for a single day.
I am confident that there is a high level of consensus at this forum regarding the fundamental values and principles that should underpin the international order and interstate or intergovernmental relations.
Without peaceful coexistence between states and peoples, mutual respect for sovereignty and the essential decolonisation of the world, there can be no stable international order.
Therefore, it is crucial to make additional efforts to reaffirm these values globally, given that challenges arising from their absence are shared by many.
It brings me great joy to have the opportunity to attend the Non-Aligned Movement Conference for the first time, right here in the heart of Africa.
I am convinced that our tradition of non-alignment and the shared values we inherit can be a powerful catalyst for better understanding and the strengthening of bilateral and multilateral cooperation with member countries of the Movement.
I am confident that this conference will proceed in a positive and constructive atmosphere, fostering open dialogue on all current challenges and exploring possibilities for overcoming them.
Congratulations to President Museveni on assuming the presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement, and to President Aliyev for successfully leading the organisation during the past challenging and complex period.
I extend my congratulations to the hosts for the excellent and successful organisation of this year's conference, expressing gratitude for the attention and the opportunity to address you.
Thank you."
99665,Address by the Chairman of BiH Presidency Željko Komšić at the European Union,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=99665&langTag=en-US,2023-12-13,"Dear President of the European Council,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am grateful for the invitation to another summit of the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans. I think it is very important to maintain the continuity of talks at the highest political level.
We are still in a very complex geopolitical moment for Europe, caused by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The situation is further complicated by Israel's disproportionate military response to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israeli civilians.
The level of indiscriminate destruction and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza has caused great turbulence in Europe and the world, and has also affected relations in the United Nations and the functioning of its institutions.
Emotions capable of raising tensions cannot be localized to regions of conflict. Media and social networks transmit emotions to other parts of the world with uncertain outcomes.
In this geopolitical context, we are discussing today, here in Brussels, the further direction of the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union.
This is good, because the active role of the European Union and its political presence can thwart potential intentions to provoke conflict situations that could lead to escalation in our region as well.
I think that escalation does not suit anyone reasonable in the region. Therefore, let us start talking about revitalizing the perspective offered to the Western Balkans by bringing it closer to the European Union.
From the perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is clear to us that our candidate status, acquired a year ago, as well as the recent conditional recommendation of the European Commission for the opening of negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, is the result of the tense geopolitical situation on the borders of the European Union and that obtaining candidate status has absolutely nothing to do with meeting the standards and realizing the assumed obligations.
Nevertheless, I certainly want to thank the Commission and the Council for their positive attitude towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I would like to be able to say that the progress in the EU integration status of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the merit of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately, the effort to adopt legislation and build the professional capacities of the state administration is not satisfactory.
Our public opinion is aware of this. The survey from 2023 shows that 73.3% of citizens still support the European integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is 4.1% less than in 2022, while the survey from 2022 shows that only 42% believe that BiH will become part of the EU by 2030, and 13% believe that it will never happen.
I still believe that the fulfilment of 14 key priorities from the Opinion of the European Commission from May 2019 is crucial for further progress of our country in the direction of harmonization with the EU acquis.
I appeal to all EU institutions, as well as to the member states that the so-called 14 priorities from the European Commission Opinion from 2019, which concern Bosnia and Herzegovina, still remain a kind of official policy of the European institutions towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. That relationship and that policy must be freed from any kind of hypocrisy on all sides.
The last intensive dialogue of the European Commission with representatives of the legislative and executive authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, entity and cantonal governments, in accordance with the established coordination mechanism within BiH, which the Commission also accepted as a working method, caused, to put it mildly, ridicule in BiH public.
The public of Bosnia and Herzegovina saw that meeting as an obvious proof of the dysfunctionality of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state, but also as proof of the dysfunctionality of the coordination mechanism itself and the relationship to the EU integrations of both the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Nevertheless, that method of work is officially and mutually accepted, and because of this, the legislative and executive bodies of all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina are obliged to play an active role in the implementation of reform processes.
In this regard, the ""Growth Plan"" for the Western Balkans can be an important support for reform processes, but also for the preservation of pro-European commitment in the circumstances of a pronounced propaganda war aimed at destroying ""European values"", not only in the Western Balkans but also in the European Union itself.
I am aware that the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted the draft ""Reform Plan"" for Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Commission last week. The document briefly includes: green and digital agenda, development of the private sector and business environment, preservation and development of human resources and the rule of law.
In the next month or two, governments and legislative bodies of all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina should show concrete progress in this direction.
In this regard, I expect the responsible officials to fulfil the obligations they have assumed, including the obligations that the leaders of the political parties assumed at the meeting with you, President Michel, exactly 18 months ago, in this same place.
Finally, concrete regulations, standards and procedures are, at first glance, far from their sphere of interest. I would therefore recommend that the European Union pay attention to the preservation of ""European values"" as a type of emotional aspect of integration that is often neglected, but turns out to be very important.
Underestimating the subjective attitude of citizens towards the value system on which the EU is based can lead to those citizens giving up on the European Union. Ultimately, the value system that we believe still exists in the EU makes us in Bosnia and Herzegovina determined to be part of the EU.
Giving up those values will turn BiH society away from the EU itself, and the EU will gain another source of instability on its borders.
Here, above all, I mean support for the elimination of discrimination based on religious, ethnic, racial, political or any other affiliation, which is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is an integral part of our Constitution.
Therefore, in the context of the rule of law, as one of the reform priorities from the draft ""Reform Plan"" of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I believe that the implementation of the six judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Sejdić-Finci, Pilav, Zornić, Šlaku, Pudarić and Kovačević is pivotal.
The geopolitical moment does not allow further procrastination and avoiding the truth, that the actual implementation of these judgments is inevitable. Only if the European Union, clearly and unequivocally, stands behind the necessity of realizing ""European values"" and the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we can get a synergy of ""emotional"" support for European values, practical visibility of the ""Plan for Growth"" and a real will for reforms that will further direct Bosnia and Herzegovina towards her European goal."
99461,"Address by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the 25th of November",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=99461&langTag=en-US,2023-11-25,"Ladies and Gentlemen citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected excellencies, appreciated guests! Today we mark and celebrate the national holiday - Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and express deep respect to the anti-fascists of the 20th century who restored statehood and defended the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A great number of ambassadors from friendly countries are with us, whom I warmly greet, and whom I sincerely thank for celebrating our national holiday with us.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the oldest European countries.
Today there are 49 countries in Europe. At the time when the medieval Bosnian state became a kingdom in 1377, there were only fifteen kingdoms in Europe, and the Bosnian Kingdom was the sixteenth. So, when most European states did not even exist, we were in the ""elite club"" of sixteen European states - kingdoms.
This fact too shows that Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the oldest European countries. The roots of our country are extremely strong and deep. They cannot be uprooted by small and fleeting politicians, because forces much bigger and stronger than them could not do that either.
In the coming period, we must strengthen the national identity.
In the last three decades, we emphasized numerous identities, but we did the least work on strengthening the state identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It's time for a turnaround. Let's all gather around the state and strengthen the state identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In particular, we must take care of the equality of all languages and, in this context, protect the Bosnian language from denial.
The Bosnian language has centuries of continuity. The following facts testify to this:
- Ban Kulin's charter dated 29.08.1189, as the oldest preserved Bosnian state document, undoubtedly confirms the historical continuity of the Bosnian language and its centuries-old written tradition.
- Constantine of Kostenets (the Philospoher) in his work Writing on Language and Spelling, written at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century, writes that the Bosnian language is an equal member of the community of Slavic languages.
- After the fall of the Bosnian kingdom, the Bosnian language acquired the status of a diplomatic language in the Ottoman Empire.
- Matija Divković in Venice in 1611 published Nauk Krstjanski in the Bosnian language.
- Stjepan Matijević published the Confessions in 1630 and wrote that it was translated from Latin into the Bosnian language.
- Muhamed Hevai Uskufi publishes the Bosnian dictionary in 1631. It was the first dictionary of the Bosnian language and the entire Štokavian dialect.
- After the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary also recognized its centuries-old name and called it the ""terrestrial Bosnian language"", and in 1890 the Grammar of the Bosnian language was published.
- Under pressure from the neighbourhood, in 1907, it was announced that the use of the previous name Bosnian language would cease.
- Nevertheless, despite all negations, in the last decade of the XX century, the Bosnian language was given back its centuries-old name.
For the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is extremely important to preserve and respect the equality of all languages. We must invest much more in education, science, culture and art. This is where the inexhaustible strength of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies.
Millions of us in the country and outside it, can and should be proud of our country, its statehood, stability, history and heroes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and its defenders have never been convicted of attacking anyone or committing genocide. That is why, among other things, it is unacceptable that Bosnia and Herzegovina is attacked by those who glorify convicted war criminals for the committed genocide.
We are legalists and we do not threaten anyone. That is why we can freely say that it is absolutely unacceptable that the leaders of BiH entity of RS threaten the independent, sovereign and indivisible state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia has existed for more than 1,000 years. Our country existed even without entities, and entities have never existed and will never exist outside the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have character and pride. We best understand those who are threatened and disenfranchised because we went through the calvary of the 1990s.
That is why I once again strongly condemn the killing of innocent civilians in the Middle East and Ukraine. There are no more or less valuable human lives. Civilized people sincerely sympathize with the families of the victims, regardless of their religious, ethnic or other affiliation.
If only the law of the stronger applies on our planet, then the human species is no different from other living beings. If anyone on the globe thinks that the main rule is the law of the stronger, he is doing harm to himself and others. We are all on this planet just a small and fleeting grain in an endless universe and we should defend the values of civilization together.
Let us protect our country when it is threatened, build a persistently more positive social environment whenever we can.
Let us develop and build relations with all friendly countries, on all meridians and parallels, and never endanger the Euro-Atlantic path of our country.
Moving towards full membership in NATO and the EU is our strategic commitment. There is no serious alternative to that decision.
If I had to be the last man in our country to say that, I would do it again.
I am not saying this because it is popular, but because it is of vital importance for the survival of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We have protected our country for centuries, and we will protect it in the times to come.
Some ask us: What is it which is yours? Ours is that which is recognized by the whole world and permanently sealed in the United Nations (UN) on 22 May, 1992. On that day, 175 countries of the world accepted our country into their family and confirmed international recognition under the name Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. To be precise, what is ours belongs to all citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. To everyone together and to no one individually because no one has the right to break what is common.
Our country was admitted to UN membership by a unanimous decision of the UN General Assembly. It is an indelible act of global recognition and our international positioning in the community of independent and equal states.
The planetary certificate of statehood, independence and sovereignty was not issued to entities, cantons, cities, or municipalities. In the UN, there is only one certificate, only one address, only one name - it is the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear friends, respected guests!
Together, let us preserve the truth about the past, let us not give up in the present, let us believe in the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
And let us fight for her!
Let us be proud of the first 1,074 years since the country of Bosnia was mentioned in historical sources.
Let us protect people and the country!
Let us protect especially children and young people!
Let us protect Bosniak and Serb, Croatian and other children equally.
These are our children, and they deserve a peaceful and secure future.
Happy Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
99446,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željko Komšić, on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=99446&langTag=en-US,2023-11-25,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dear friends... It is with particular pleasure that I wish to congratulate you the 25th of November - the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a permanent reminder of the historical day, the 25th of November, 1943, when the First Session of the National Anti-Fascist Council for the People's Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBIH) began in Mrkonjić-Grad.
With the session of ZAVNOBiH in the difficult wartime circumstances of the fascist occupation, the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was restored, its continuity, independence and equality of all its citizens were outlined.
Actors who had not only different national, but also political and ideological commitments participated in that process, but they had one principle in common: The principle of freedom!
The session of ZAVNOBiH, which was at the same time the highest political body of the People's Liberation Movement, was preceded by a determined and courageous fight for freedom and the state.
The decisions that were adopted at the First, then at the Second and Third sessions of ZAVNOBiH are only an expression of that military and political struggle.
In order to fully understand the historical significance of ZAVNOBiH today, in a kind of centuries-old historical register, it is necessary to recall the fact that no less than four states have existed on the territory of our country in the last hundred years.
Two of those states, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the Independent State of Croatia, did not count on the existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state at all and stifled every personality of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their Greater Serbian and Greater Croatian hegemonic character basically sought to nullify everything Bosnian in terms of statehood and identity.
The other two states, i.e. republics, the socialist one which was created in ZAVNOBiH and the independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which was declared after the independence referendum, were created on exactly the opposite basis, on the basis of Bosnian statehood and the struggle for freedom, despite the aforementioned hegemonic aspirations that were accompanied by the most serious forms of war crimes against the citizens and people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As Bosnians and Herzegovinans, we never felt as our own states those state forms that were imposed on us without being asked about it, and we were not asked about it precisely and only in those periods when we were not organized, neither politically nor militarily.
In those moments, when there was no clear Bosnian strength, then the power and dominance of neighbouring countries was imposed on us in our own country.
ZAVNOBiH, as a precedent in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is not only a proof of the continuity of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also an interruption of the continuity of the alienation of the country and the formation of a foreign administration. In addition to anti-fascism, this is its greatest value. No matter how it sounds to some, history inexorably teaches us the following:
Both times in the last hundred years when we used weapons to fight for the country, we defended it, and both times, when this was not the case, we lost it.
However, neither the first nor the second republic won because of weapons, which they had in much smaller quantities than their enemies anyway, but they won thanks to the principle of freedom that guided them and the commitment to freedom that they fought for, both as members of the National Liberation Movement , as well as members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The only thing more important than what you fight is what you fight for. Without resources and means, it is difficult to survive, but without the feeling of standing up for justice and freedom, almost every struggle is doomed in advance.
Today, exactly 80 years after ZAVNOBiH and a bit more than 30 years after the referendum on independence, when we look around us and reflect on events, both in the East and in the West, we can clearly see that the freedom we live and enjoy in our own homeland is not to be underestimated, but it is neither given forever nor guaranteed.
The society we live in, despite all the difficulties that are present, is not a society in which there is no freedom and in which there is no perspective. It is democratic in its essence and character, although democracy is often denied to us. True, unfortunately, this cannot be said for those parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina dominated by policies that reject the libertarian values of ZAVNOBiH, but the most vital part of Bosnia and Herzegovina is democratic and free.
Sometimes it seems that our virtue is also our weakness, but when one realizes that the survival and continuous struggle for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina depends on those who possess strength and are free in spirit and beliefs, then it is not a weakness, but a necessary prerequisite for preserving the hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina will one day become a normal and stable country. It is true that we as a country and as citizens must be aware of where we are, what we are surrounded by, who we are directed to and what we are committed to. But we also need to know that no one but ourselves is the guarantor of the survival and development of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We respect the strength and importance of international associations whose membership we seek because it is in our interest, but we neither need nor are we obliged to blindly identify the existence of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the fate of the aforementioned associations. In the end, Bosnia and Herzegovina is our permanent value, and interests are changeable.
May optimism and fighting spirit guide us in these uncertain times, and may the memory of our past inspire us to build a future in which Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a country of peace, stability and prosperity for all its citizens. And let our strength lie in our uniqueness and commitment to the idea of freedom, that is the foundation on which we should build our tomorrow.
Dear women of Bosnia and Herzegovina, dear men of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when we talk about the future of our homeland, in essence, everything comes down to the freedom of us citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to our will and desire to preserve the freedom we have won and defended, but also to defend it if that's what it takes!
Happy Statehood Day!"
99199,"Address by the Chairman of the BiH Presidency, Željko Komšić, at the session of the United Nations Security Council in New York dedicated to the High Representative's Report on the situation in Bosnia",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=99199&langTag=en-US,2023-11-02,"At the beginning, I would like to express my respect and congratulations to the President of the Security Council, as well as my satisfaction with the extension of the mandate of the EUFOR Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The occasion for my address today refers to the past six-months period presented in the Report of the Office of the High Representative, with special emphasis on several very important facts that shape political events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the activities of the High Representative. At the very beginning of my address, I would like to remind you that the legitimate goal of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Dayton Peace Agreement was the establishment of peace, which was certainly achieved in the previous twenty-eight years. After the establishment of peace, Bosnia and Herzegovina entered the process of its transition towards a modern democratic state, which is the next goal and to which full attention should be given.
Unfortunately, after twenty-eight years of the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina still has not completed the entire path of its democratic transition, and has remained trapped in the vortex of ethnically based policies and various ethnically projected goals.
The Dayton Peace Agreement itself has become a tool for various geopolitical contests between different players on the geopolitical scene.
In these geopolitical contests, we can also notice a common denominator that is the same for different geopolitical actors, and it refers to the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not actually allowed to transition to a modern democratic state, and therefore it remains stuck in ethnic policies, which are aimed to complete collapse of political and social system in the country.
In fact, ethnic politics and ethnic groups are used to create tension and destabilization, in order to achieve short-term and long-term geopolitical goals more easily.
I consider such geopolitical behavior towards Bosnia and Herzegovina absolutely unacceptable.
Through such a prism, we look at this and all next reports of the Office of High Representative. The fact about different geopolitical games are being played in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we can simply show through efforts of various actors and political groups, to challenge the legitimacy of High Representative, thus trying to create space for the implementation of planned geopolitical interests.
Regardless of the fact that there are political debates in Bosnia and Herzegovina about whether High Representative is legitimate or whether he was elected in accordance with the appropriate procedure, I would like to clearly point out that I support the existence of the Office of High Representative, until the realization of the so-called ""5+2 conditions"" creates an environment for the closure of the OHR.
I do not want to participate in any unnecessary discussion about whether the High Representative is legitimate or not, because Bosnia and Herzegovina has no role in the appointment of High Representatives, and only those who appoint High Representative can answer that question.
Even High Representative himself cannot give an interpretation about his own appointment, because he does not appoint himself.
As for the specific Report of High Representative, it is necessary to highlight several very important elements, which High Representative himself did not mention in his report or did not present in an appropriate manner.
Firstly, current High Representative is the first to face mass protests by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who protested on two occasions in front of High Representative's Office, expressing their dissatisfaction with his behavior and announced decisions.
The large number of both gatherings of citizens, in which no political parties participated, tells us that citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are aware of all important issues in our country, but also that they are aware and dissatisfied with some bad decisions made by the current High Representative. I believe that High Representative will appreciate and respect this in his future work, especially in the field of making future decisions.
Secondly, there are some decisions of High Representative which are good and protect the constitutional order in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but unfortunately, that decisions were insufficient and vague. Because of the vagueness of those decisions of High Representative, political tensions grew, as well as efforts to further ethnically divide Bosnia and Herzegovina until its complete dissolution.
Unfortunately, it is clear that High Representative deals relatively poorly with such political efforts. It is necessary to emphasize there is a great disproportion between the views presented in his report in relation to what High Representative is really doing to overcome these problems. His diagnosis of the problem, which concerns behavior of actors from Republika Srpska entity, in which they talk about an alleged peaceful separation, peaceful dissolution or entity competences, is certainly correct, but his diagnosis is not followed by adequate activities.
Whether this behavior of High Representative is caused by lack of his capacities or because of lack of support from the international community, is a question that deserves a clear and precise answer. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina expect such an answer, especially in the new geopolitical context.
Also, I would like to point out that I will appreciate every effort of High Representative that, when blockages arise in the functioning of state institutions, he tries to solve occurred blockages through his role as a mediator. This is certainly his obligation, determined by Annex 10 of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
When difficulties arise in the functioning of the state government, due to the different political interests of two entities, only then High Representative can appear in his role of mediator.
However, the actions of the current High Representative are usually not inside his role of a mediator, as required by Annex 10 of the Dayton Peace Agreement, but rather, towards one entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is set as pro-active, while towards the entity Republika Srpska, it is set as reactive. Such different actions connected with different treatment of difficulties in the functioning of the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina puts High Representative in a very compromising position, because it creates a possible sense of his political insecurity and bias.
Thirdly, we are particularly concerned by the statement of the prime minister of a neighboring country, that they lobbied the High Representative to impose such changes to the entity constitution and the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which correspond to the political interests of the neighboring country, not Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the detriment of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here, of course, I am referring to the Prime Minister and the Government of the neighboring country of Croatia.
This can be a significant evidence and indicator of the bias of High Representative, which then opens up many other questions. One of these questions relates to the fact that the creation of ethnically pure territories in Bosnia and Herzegovina is under the de-facto political control of neighboring states, which High Representative did through the imposed model of elections for the upper house of the legislative body in entity Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such an effort is certainly not good or appropriate practice.
Fourthly, I would like to highlight one sentence from the Opinion of the European Commission on Bosnia and Herzegovina's application for membership in the European Union, which states that the election for the House of Peoples, based on ethnicity and place of residence, is not in accordance with European standards.
Unfortunately, it was exactly High Representative who based the elections for the entity House of Peoples on ethnicity and place of residence, giving living human beings an ethnic coefficient or a different mathematical value, which is an expression of extreme discrimination and is in complete contradiction to the key priorities that the European Union puts to Bosnia and Herzegovina as an obligation.
With this, High Representative slowed down the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina within European integration.
Whether such a thing is an expression of his political will, eventual clumsiness, ignorance or whether he is possibly implementing the policies of a part of the international community or neighboring country, remains an open question.
This is especially evident when we look at the extent to which the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights are being avoided, since those judgements set up obligation to Bosnia and Herzegovina to change the entire political paradigm for its alignment with democratic standards.
There are two groups of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights: the first is the ""Sejdić-Finci and other related cases"" group, which calls for the protection of passive voting rights.
The second is the ""Kovačević"" case, which calls for the protection of active voting rights and the rejection of the ethnic concept in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the elimination of all those elements that undermine democracy in order to insure equality of all citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The judgment of the European Court in the ""Kovačević"" case opens up space for the necessary transition towards a normal democratic state, harmonized with European standards and democratic values.
For this reason, I consider certain comments of some domestic political factors on ""Kovačević"" judgement as completely inappropriate, especially since the efforts of domestic and international political actors are obviously aimed at maintaining the ethnic concept and ethnic divisions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the same political ambition of the neighboring countries.
As fifth, it is not possible to avoid the fact that High Representative showed his bias by allowing one political group to form a new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina, contrary to the election results, by suspending the entity constitution for twenty-four hours. This was an unprecedented attack on the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina, because the suspension of any constitution cannot have its own legitimate goal.
These are also not good practices, because they portray High Representative as a biased person, which, due to the work he performs, he should never be.
Sixth, I want to express great concern about the efforts of High Representative to solve the issue of state property, in a controversial way, implying the need to distribute state property. His ideas about state property distribution deviate from good practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina, because property is not territory, nor is territory property, so no one has the right to treat it that way.
Finally, I would like to point out again that I strongly support the existence of the Office of High Representative until so called ""5+2 conditions"" are met, and I call on the international community to cooperate in the realization of these conditions. We are fully aware that “5+2 conditions"" are made very wide and unclear and that their fulfillment is difficult to show statistically, but that conditions are very important and make Bosnia and Herzegovina a normal democratic state, which must be able to manage all internal processes.
For these reasons, I am asking for the support of the international community to finally establish full democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as full rule of law and full protection of individual human and civil rights. On that path, the main priority should be the implementation of all judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. It is the only way we can make a significant step towards stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the stabilization of the entire region of the Western Balkans and thus respond to existing geopolitical challenges. Everything else represents a path to possible uncontrolled situations, which will be very difficult to manage and for which it is difficult to assess how badly they could end.
Thank you very much for your attention."

Chairman Komšić's address:
""The European political community is an example of multilateralism that is used to strengthen commitment to our common political idea of Europe, which is based on liberal democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Our voice against Russian aggression against Ukraine is a clear sign that the European political community opposes violent border changes and aggression. This is based on our common system of values and determination to persist in the fight for those values. I was in Ukraine two months ago and I firmly believe that the outcome of that war will determine the future of European political architecture.
Multilateralism continues to function within the principles of consultation, inclusiveness and solidarity. Multilateralism allows us to reach common opinions and launch joint actions on various issues, from climate change and the response to COVID 19, to supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine. However, I believe that sustainable and effective cooperation does not follow. The main challenge is the implementation of what has been agreed and ways of overcoming the challenges multilateralism faces, which concern the sovereign interests of states. What we are facing is that the 'ad hoc' interests of sovereign states threaten to jeopardise the very foundations of multilateralism. When multilateralism is weak, geostrategy dominates and security issues grow.
Now it may be difficult to distinguish between security and geostrategic issues. Ten years ago, Europe was under terrorist attacks by ISIL. At that time, an unprecedented wave of migration caused enormous humanitarian and political problems. After that, the COVID-19 pandemic called into question the principle of solidarity as well as the economy. Today we are witnessing cyber threats, misuse of social networks and artificial intelligence. Growing radical chauvinist populism profits from uncontrolled cyberspace while spreading hate speech and undermining efforts to promote human rights and universal values.
These challenges undermine the very basis of multilateralism and our shared values on which Europe is built. Moreover, it is no different at the global level. I was recently at the UN General Assembly where all the speeches dealt with individual state problems packaged under multilateral themes, while injustices and latent hypocrisy in multilateral institutions were identified.
Therefore, my message is that the process of undermining the effects of multilateralism, and questioning the fundamental values shared by civilized societies, directly favours totalitarian, undemocratic regimes. I believe that this process is intentional. It is an attack on the current world architecture; the architecture based on respect for democracy and human rights. It is intended to subvert multilateralism with the support of political players operating within various multilateral institutions who are trying to question the basic values on which the multilateral organizations are built and the purposes for which they were built."""
98982,"Address of the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of marking the 120th anniversary of the Bosnian cultural community “Preporod“",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98982&langTag=en-US,2023-09-28,"Dear guests, respected president of the Bosniak cultural community of “Preporod“, Dr Sanjin Kodrić, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen! I have the honour and special pleasure to, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, be the high patron of the great jubilee - the 120th anniversary of the founding of the Bosniak Community of Culture (BZK) ""Preporod"" and the jubilee concert - the world premiere of the symphonic suite ""Storia bosniaca"", by composer Ammar Jažić. ""Preporod"" is a cultural exemplar, the fundamental and oldest cultural institution of Bosniaks.
Tonight, we celebrate not only 120 years of the ""Preporod"" work, but also an important moment of our cultural renaissance. Essentially, ""Preporod"" has the status of a Bosniak cultural matrix that has gathered and still gathers Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the states of the former Yugoslavia, as well as throughout Europe and the world.
It is very important to show respect and support to the creative and intelligent people of ""Preporod"" in their extremely important mission of studying, developing and preserving our culture, history, science and art. At the same time, it is important to point out that the leaders of ""Preporod"" have not treated this responsible job in isolation and separately from others, but as a reasonable and purposeful job, connected with the cultural and scientific achievements of other nations.
The history of the BZK ""Preporod"" begins with the founding of the company ""Gajret"" in 1903 and ""Narodna uzdanica"" in 1924.
Both societies developed various forms of cultural and educational work, as well as a rich publishing activity. The ""Gajret"" also had its own schools, and dozens of local organizations of these societies were present in almost every place in Bosnia and Herzegovina and beyond.
Until the Second World War, the society ""Gajret"" educated as many as two thirds of Bosniak intellectuals. The first president of the company ""Gajret"" was Dr Safvet-beg Bašagić, a literary and cultural giant from the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Along with Bašagić as the initiator and founder, many other prominent Bosniak and Bosnia-Herzegovina writers, painters, composers, ethnomusicologists, top intellectuals and scientists, social workers and politicians are part of the institutional history of ""Preporod"".
By uniting ""Gajret"" and ""Narodna Uzdanica"", these two societies formed the Muslim Cultural Society ""Preporod"" in 1945. Four years later, in specific historical circumstances, all national cultural societies were abolished, including ""Preporod"", which caused great damage to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s society.
The work and activities of today's the BZK ""Preporod"" were renewed only in 1990, when a new era of this old and respected institution began. In the new era, when ""Preporod"" operates in the independent, sovereign and internationally recognized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numerous projects of fundamental social importance have been implemented.
The intellectuals who have flourished within ""Preporod"" in the previous 120 years made an immeasurable contribution to the development and construction of cultural, scientific and other institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
If we were to express the past of ""Preporod"" in a summarized way, then we could state that it is a constant struggle for the development of culture and enlightenment, the expansion of publishing activities, the opening of new schools, the introduction of contemporary literature, philosophical and social thought, modern European theatre, art, classical music and a number of new contents. The history of ""Preporod"" is the history of the development of numerous capital cultural and scientific projects and the creation of a platform for the affirmation of contemporary cultural and artistic creativity.
""Preporod"" is a cultural institution that, with its projects, programs and activities, has made an important contribution to finding answers to the needs and challenges of the culture and identity of Bosniaks as a nation, and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why this is a great jubilee that people in ""Preporod"", as well as the whole society, can and should be proud of.
New times provide new opportunities.
Among the many projects that are realized today in ""Preporod"" is the unique project of creating the first Bosnian-Herzegovinian royal opera ""Tvrtko, kralj bosanski"", (Tvrtko, the King of Bosnia) based on the novel by Jasmin Imamović. It is a great honour for me to be, as a member of BiH Presidency, the patron of our first royal opera.
It is very important that the relevant authorities help all cultural institutions and communities more concretely. When it comes to ""Preporod"", I especially want to emphasize the importance of support for three crucial areas: contemporary cultural practice, cultural heritage and research in the field of humanities and social sciences of importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a country.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a plural, multi-ethnic and multicultural society for centuries. It is our fortune, not our curse.
As a member of the Presidency of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would like to point out the fact that ""Preporod"" has continuously affirmed a plural and multi-ethnic society, in cooperation with others and with the aim of creating a common good. In these difficult times, when many attack the multi-ethnic being of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we must not be afraid to speak about the importance of defending that historically grounded being.
The contributions and cultural organizations of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina greatly contributed to the defence and affirmation of multiculturalism and multi-ethnicity. That is why the Bosniak cultural community ""Preporod"", the Croat cultural society ""Napredak"", the Serb educational and cultural society ""Prosvjeta"" and the Jewish cultural, educational and humanitarian society ""La Benevolencija"" should be seen as affirmers of the culture of our inextricably linked peoples, as well as important factors in the unique intercultural mosaic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the time to come, we need to build confidence in our own values. We must not hesitate to respect and develop our own being and tradition.
Why did the Bosniak elite in most of the 20th century renounce their own name, language and identity? This issue deserves a special analysis by sociologists, political scientists, historians and other scientific workers.
It is incorrect to claim that this feeling of Bosniak subordination began in 1945. The real causes of this phenomenon should be sought in the complex social and political circumstances of the entire Bosniak existence, especially in the last two centuries. This is serious job for scientists, not superficial politicians.
Politics and parties will change, but one thing should not change anymore. Bosniaks must never again renounce themselves, their identity and culture.
The strategic interest of Bosniaks, as well as Serbs, Croats and others, is the development of a democratic and European Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent, sovereign and indivisible state of equal citizens and nations. We must not give up on that goal.
Finally, I would like to especially thank the people in ""Preporod"" for the affirmation of the culture of remembrance and the culture of memory, in which the role of the intellectuals gathered around ""Preporod"" should be especially emphasized.
Today, we need such free-thinking people more than ever before. Let us bring back people from science and culture to political life.
Let us not forget, there is no self-aware nation without institutions, culture and identity. Let us develop awareness of the irreplaceable importance of culture as the fundamental origin of a nation's identity.
Let us open room for even more free affirmation and articulation of identity peculiarities in the authentic and indivisible mosaic of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s interculturality.
Dear friends!
I congratulate you on your great jubilee, 120 years of existence of the BZK ""Preporod"", with the wish that the important mission of ""Preporod"" continues in free and multicultural Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you for your attention!"
98892,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, H.E. Željko Komšić, at the General Debate of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assemb",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98892&langTag=en-US,2023-09-20,"Mr. President Francis, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen! Building on the theme of this year's Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is the ‘Rebuilding trust and Reigniting Global Solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all’, at this important place, allow me to talk about important elements from the point of view of a small, yet proud, state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For its part, Bosnia and Herzegovina has given support to the 2030 Agenda, especially its goals, that, to the greatest extent, concern the creation of the world and the environment in the United Nations member countries, in a way that we as states and their societies, are prepared and specially trained to implement all the steps that will lead us to self-sustainable development.
However, in today's world, often dominated by war and various geopolitical goals, it will be very difficult to achieve this, at least in the way as it was planned in the 2030 Agenda.
For this reason, I specifically wish to emphasize that the first step, with which we must start our activities, is the one that will lead us to permanent peace, as the world's priority number one, and then to other mutually related activities, in order to have our countries and societies ready for solidarity and progress.
These activities are by no means easy, and they require a lot of wisdom, planning and good management of all processes and procedures that can lead us to the implementation of the Agenda 2030.
If we start from the premise offered as the theme of this year's session of the United Nations General Assembly, which talks about building trust and encouraging global solidarity, then I feel free to point out, in a few sentences, the elements that could possibly make achieving these goals difficult.
At the very beginning, I take this opportunity to remind you that migrations are one of the elements of the Agenda 2030, trying to be dealt with systematically and with specific governance.
Although the Agenda for Sustainable Development until 2030 recognizes migrants as ""agents of change and development"" in countries of their origin, transit and destination"", the Agenda primarily focuses on migrants as beneficiaries of sustainable development goals (e.g. through a higher level of protection, their rights and transparency).
Furthermore, the Agenda does not refer to the broader concept of the diaspora or to the role it plays as a possible means of development.
This statement, extracted from one of the IOM (International Organization for Migration) documents, is most certainly true, but when we come to the starting point of migrations, that is, go out into the field in certain countries, then we will certainly see several things that are undeniably happening.
The current form of migration management has reached such a stage where large and powerful countries, for their own benefit, carry out a certain type of selection of migrants, in such a way as to select the best and most educated among them, such as doctors, engineers, scientists and other highly qualified persons, and are ushering them to larger countries where their knowledge and abilities are exploited, exclusively for the benefit of these larger systems.
In larger countries and larger systems, such selected migrants can be ""agents of change"" or bearers of various improvements, but, at the same time, the potentials and capacities of the smaller countries from which the migrants are coming from, are weakened.
Small countries, in addition to losing the best quality personnel, are also losing all the investments made, including the financial ones. The investments made in creating these highly qualified profiles.
Of course, it is completely clear that there is such a form of migration, in which large groups of people are trying to escape war and the horrors of war, but there is also what we call economic migration, through which migrants are being directed, based on their potential and capacity.
In both cases of migration, large countries and their larger systems are the ones who are doing the selection and choosing the best profiles of migrants, in line with their needs and aspirations, while, at the same time, the systemic weakening of the small countries from which the migrants come from is taking place. What do I mean by this?
In short, it is difficult to talk about building trust while larger countries and their large systems are taking over the population of smaller countries through migration, and, simultaneously, the smaller countries are emptying out, resulting in the creation of an environment in which poverty develops and completely prevents any form of development in economic and social sense.
Thus, a direct attack is made on the possibility of creating prerequisites for self-sustainable development in smaller countries.
From the point of view of my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is very easy to provide additional arguments and proof confirming this matter.
In my country, there is a significant outflow of the population, going to larger and more developed countries, mostly to countries we view as western democratic countries.
While investigating why our people, Bosnians and Herzegovinans, decide to leave their country, and look for better living conditions in some other countries, we came to a conclusion that the fundamental reason for their departure is their conviction of the lack of perspective in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
When we took into account what our people have stated as one of the basic shortcomings of the perspective in their country, we saw that it is refers to how, specifically, the political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not entail complete democracy, but rather a form of ethnocracy, or a system in which elections for government institutions, exercise of power, distribution of jobs in the state, even in the real sector, are primarily based on ethnicity as a prerequisite.
In such a system, you usually don't have the best people in key positions, people who, with their knowledge and abilities, can build a political, economic and social system in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the contrary, you have ethnically and politically suitable staff who can hardly be expected to lead the overall progress of the country.
This value system has been going on for a very long time. In such a system, the key jobs are not performed by the best and most qualified people, but by the politically and ethnically suitable ones. The current political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based exclusively on ethnic and then on political affiliation, completely degrades democracy as an important principle for creating an environment with equal opportunities for all people.
Such a system, which guarantees participation in government to certain political actors and their ethnically based political parties, has the form of former and current totalitarian systems, in which power is exercised in an autocratic manner, through autocratically inspired political actors.
As a result of this unfinished political system, we have a slow development of the country, while such politics obstruct what, in my opinion, is one of the key goals of my country - its path to membership in larger supranational systems such as the European Union or NATO Alliance.
The irremovability, or particularly difficult replaceability of the authorities, creates such an environment where even the authorities themselves no longer work for the benefit of their citizens, because they feel that there is no need for such a thing. The distribution of political and social power is already guaranteed to them in advance by the system itself, a system based on ethnicity.
Our current political system is skillfully used by our western and eastern neighbors, and through ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to which they claim national rights, they are running Bosnia and Herzegovina, not with the primary aim of helping the members of these ethnic communities, but with the aim of dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina or making it meaningless as a state.
Our two neighbors, through the ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to which they strive to claim every right, even twenty-seven years after the aggression they had carried out over Bosnia and Herzegovina, are in this manner, making an attack on the sovereignty of our country, which makes it almost completely impossible to have any democratic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This practice also violates the minimum of interstate trust, because unfortunately, our neighbors are not investing sincere energy with the goal of building interstate cooperation, but are rather investing energy in weakening our state.
This is a visible problem, which extends to the entire region of the Western Balkans, where there are different ideas, plans and intentions to change the internationally recognized borders, to reorganize the region into something that has no point of contact with democracy.
For such activities and policies, neighboring countries very often have, at first glance, surprising and unexpected support from countries that we consider to be democratic liberal states and societies, but certainly also from those that are not democratic, and that we today recognize as aggressor states with authoritarian regimes.
Regretfully, there are many, both in the East and the West, who believe that their barely hidden support for those who want to completely control, and ultimately divide Bosnia and Herzegovina, will bring stability to the Western Balkans.
We, who represent the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina here at the United Nations, believe that this will not bring either stability or progress in the Western Balkans.
Our neighbors cannot divide Bosnia and Herzegovina among themselves without entering into mutual conflict. We will certainly not allow the division and disappearance of our thousand-year-old state, at any cost, no matter what anyone thinks about it.
That is why we believe that it is in the interest of the United Nations, if peace is to be preserved in the Western Balkans, to support the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its institutions.
If the United Nations wishes to preserve peace in the Western Balkans, then it should support those who have not violated democratic and civilizational norms, who have not committed genocide, were not part of joint criminal enterprises, did not destroy people's lives because of their ethnicity, did not destroy other people's temples and shrines, did not advocate revanchism and revenge.
If such support is absent, then the responsibility and blame for destabilization does not lie with us, who will certainly not calmly and idly observe some new attempt to destroy our Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, the fundamental problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in the inequality of citizens in the political and electoral system, the result of which is an ethnic system of governing the country, a system that is destined to be conflictual.
In addition, the ethnic system of exercising power in my country continuously creates space for nepotism and corruption in all segments of society, especially in government institutions.
As a consequence of the ethnic system of exercising power, we have nepotism in the selection of people to perform the most important political and economic jobs. The ethnic political system in my country is the one that generates and encourages nepotism and corruption the most, and nepotism and corruption destroy social cohesion and trust within a society the most.
That is why, for decades, we have not been able to create a society of equals, and with that, a society of equal opportunities, because with the employment through family connections and corruption pertaining to most important positions, one loses hope in the possibility of having a positive perspective.
So from this place, I want to ask an important question - How is it possible to build and achieve trust, that will lead to the creation of prerequisites for development, when we don’t actually have enough democracy in our country, when our right to democracy is being taken away, and when an embargo to democracy is being imposed upon us, which leads citizens to great uncertainty and is the reason why they often decide to leave the country?
The latest interventions of the international representatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. the intervention of the High Representative, by means of legal violence and the suspension of the Entity Constitution for twenty-four hours, which is an inconceivable precedent in the democratic world, did not remove obstacles to the normal functioning of the state, but rather strengthened the undemocratic ethnic principle and deepened the discrimination of citizens in the Constitution and the Electoral Law.
Democracy is the most important segment for building trust, both in our countries and globally.
It is very important, in order to create prerequisites for self-sustainable development, that the transition in these societies ends as soon as possible, through the transition from former totalitarian, autocratic systems, to a system based on full democracy.
That is why we expect the support of actors from the international community, even though they occasionally resort to undemocratic tools, like they occasionally completely deny the possibility of the development of democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the sake of their goals.
Of course, we are fully aware that there is a number of countries, members of the United Nations, with such history and historical context that they are not interested in democracy and its development. On the other hand, some indicators tell us that over 2/3 of the countries, members of the United Nations, are oriented towards democracy and its development, so my point of view is oriented in that direction as well.
I wish to add another important element here, which is indispensable in building trust for self-sustainable development. It is achieving a system of full human rights, which as its final outcome offers a society of equal people, equal citizens, and as a result of that, we can have a society of equal chances, with open perspectives for everyone.
If you do not have a system of equals, i.e. equal citizens, then it will be difficult to build trust in such a system, especially in a, still, post-war society such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Particularly if you have in mind, that our society has suffered aggression from our western and eastern neighboring countries, a direct consequence of which were the committed atrocious war crimes, and even the crime of genocide.
Such scenarios for Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be implemented, through political means, in peacetime conditions, while continuously asking for support from various parts of the international community.
At the same time, and regardless of the aforementioned scenarios, our obligation is to create internal prerequisites for building a society of equal people, i.e. equal citizens, as one of the basic ""tools"" that will enable us to avoid the possibility of future conflicts. Contained within the judgments of the eminent courts that deal with the protection of human rights, such as the European Court of Human Rights, there is a valuable resource for building a stable society in which the risk of internal conflict is reduced to a minimum. These judgements also take away an effective mechanism for violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the hands of potentially aggressive politics of the neighboring countries.
In short, this means that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to change the entire paradigm within society, and shift from ethnic political representation to civic political representation, which is the standard in a democratic world.
We must use this opportunity to draw attention of the United Nations, on something that is, in my opinion, and I am sorry to say this, a very uncivilized stand of the Government and the Prime Minister of our neighboring country who have rejected a Judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, the latest judgement in the Kovačević Case, and have stood up for the very principles that were rejected in mentioned judgment, like the political principle of legitimate representation based on ethnicity, which is a generator of inequality among the citizens of BiH, and a means by which the neighbors undermine the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was done in such a way that it can be qualified as an interference in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The disrespect for the judgments of international courts, as could be heard from the Prime Minister of a neighboring country, is reminiscent of the attitudes towards international law that Vladimir Putin has built in the case of Ukraine.
However, this is not only about having a negative attitude towards the international standards of the United Nations, but also a policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina conducted by its neighbors.
Only when civic political representation is accepted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the implementation of the judgments of the European Court, and when, in parallel, the attacks on the sovereignty of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the neighborhood stop, only then will we be able to participate in projects at full capacity and more efficiently, such as Agenda 2030, as an equal participant and actor of all planned activities.
In that case, we, as a country, will be ready and equipped with the potential to accept all the challenges posed before us by the self-sustainable development activities, to build our mutual social trust as a society of equals, and to be an active actor in building trust on a global level.
I believe you share my opinion that, in societies dominated by inequality, you will not be able to be a legitimate actor in promoting ideas of self-sustainable development, through building trust and global solidarity for all.
For such a thing, it is necessary to, first of all, reform our society in a way in which it will be able to understand the importance of solidarity for everyone, with people who are equal in everything in that system and who can produce solidarity towards others on an equal grounds.
In the conclusion of this address, and in addition to everything previously stated, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina will actively work on the implementation of Agenda 2030. We will work on building trust and solidarity.
By rejecting the discriminatory ethnic concept, we will simultaneously reject the system dominated by nepotism and corruption, and thus bring our society into the ranks of democratic and mature societies.
Then we will become a society and a country that can actively participate in world processes, within the framework of the fundamental principles on which the current world order and what we call the international community, rest.
The transition process of our society can and should be relatively short, because the equality of all people is the basic premise of every modern democratic society, and, in this respect, we count on the support of that part of the international community that can help us in this.
I am aware of the existence of those other parts of the international community, which, for their geopolitical reasons, will offer resistance in order to keep Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the entire region of the Western Balkans, in a continuous state of destabilization and tension. Such people do not want democracy, but ethnocracy, disorder and violence.
And finally, I can say with certainty that Bosnia and Herzegovina has become a place where democracy and its values are defended. And there are only two sides - the one that is in favor of democracy and its values and the other side that is an opponent of democracy because its goal is the establishment of autocratic systems, undemocratic in character.
Thank you, Mr. President!"

It is always a pleasure to be here in Belgrade, especially when the occasion is as significant and beautiful as the one tonight. It is a great honour for me to attend the ceremonial opening of the traditional event ""Days of Srpska in Serbia"", which our representative office in the Serbian capital has organised for the 11th time. As every year, it will be a great opportunity to promote Republika Srpska, as well as its economic, cultural, natural, tourist and all other potentials. It will be an opportunity for Republika Srpska to present itself in the best light in 11 cities across fraternal Serbia.
I am grateful to our people from the Representative Office, headed by Mr. Cicović, for the dedication and enormous effort they put into the implementation of this important project every year.
I am certainly grateful to the institutions of Serbia, its local communities and all the individuals who participate in this event.
It represents a strong incentive to further strengthen the never better and more substantial relations between the Republika Srpska and Serbia.
We are very proud of our ties with Serbia, which is the best friend, the most important ally and the strongest support for Republika Srpska.
We are proud of every jointly built facility, kindergarten, school, bridge, hospital, cultural center in almost every local community.
We are also proud of every new kilometer of highway, newly opened factory, as well as all the successes of Serbia, whether it is economy, culture or sports.
I believe and know that every Bogdanović’s three pointer in Manila was celebrated with the same joy in Banja Luka, East Sarajevo and Trebinje, as well as in Belgrade, Niš or Novi Sad.
It was celebrated just as the silver medals of the basketball and volleyball players, the winner's cup of Ivana Vuleta or Nole's record 24th Grand Slam title.
And all that in less than a month. What a sports superpower!
Besides sports, we want to win together in all other areas.
When I say that, I immediately think of the Banja Luka - Belgrade highway, a symbol of our integration, the construction of which is underway and which will be of inestimable importance for our citizens and economy.
I'm also thinking of other important projects, such as the airport in Trebinje and the Buk Bijela hydroelectric plant, the implementation of which has been the subject of pointless political blockades for years.
When I say victory, I mean new jobs, faster economic development, better infrastructural connectivity, all that brings benefits to all of us, and harm to absolutely no one.
Always and above all, I think of peace, stability and security, which are the prerequisites for successful cooperation, development and prosperity.
In these challenging times, it is important that both Serbia and Republika Srpska remain stable, that they strengthen their position as well as mutual cooperation.
The strengthening of cooperation and stronger connection between our citizens and institutions is one of the main goals of this event, which we are officially opening tonight.
I wish you much luck and success in the implementation of all planned activities throughout Serbia.
I strongly believe that, as in previous years, you will present Republika Srpska and its potential in the best possible way.
Long live Republika Srpska!
Long live Serbia!"

The importance of gatherings like this one in Budapest is thus all that greater, as well as our obligation to try to draw public attention to the challenges in the field of demography that are common to almost all European countries.
If demography is the key to our survival - and I believe we agree that this is an elementary biological fact - then the family is certainly a prerequisite for a stable demographic development.
A strong family, based on marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and not any variation on the theme, is the foundation of a successful society.
If a country records negative natural growth and extremely unfavorable demographic trends for a long period of time, this may lead to numerous disturbances in its functioning in the future.
And of course, facing such challenges requires a comprehensive overview of their causes, and not only by competent institutions, but also by the professional community, the media, the academic community, the civil sector, that is, by society as a whole.
Discussions about demography and pro-natal policies are often reduced exclusively to financial or material aspects.
And of course, governments define certain measures, allocate money, create tax incentives, provide various benefits, give favorable loans to young married couples, help them solve the housing issues, and so on.
This material or financial segment is very important and indispensable for any country that approaches this issue seriously.
Just as a certain existential and financial security is important for starting and expanding a family.
However, if financial security and a good standard of living were the only prerequisites for demographic development, then we probably wouldn't even be talking about this topic in Europe, at least not in this way.
How to explain that most countries with a high standard of living, including almost all European ones, record negative rates of natural growth, while in less developed countries in the rest of the world the birth rates are so much higher?
This clearly indicates that the causes of the demographic crisis are much deeper and more complex than it may seem at first glance.
One of the main causes is the crisis of the family, which is again conditioned by modern cultural and value patterns.
We have witnessed that in recent decades, all traditional institutions, from the family, through religious communities, to the sovereign state, are under strong attacks.
Value systems that are not compatible with our traditional values are constantly being imposed on our countries and peoples through contemporary culture, mainstream media and various international, governmental and non-governmental organizations.
Any authenticity is perceived as hostile, and all those who do not fit into these globalist and liberal narratives are exposed to criticism, pressure, and various restrictive measures.
There is a tendency for a cultural and political unification of states and peoples, within which we should take over the identity of others and renounce our own.
In such a world, there is no place for the promotion of family values. But on the other side, there is so much room for aggressive propaganda and promotion of the rights of those who do not belong to the traditional family concept where the family is based on the union of a man and a woman and their male and female children.
If one asks a logical question - where does all this lead, you will immediately be labeled as a homophobe, an extremist and someone who does not respect human and minority rights; and all this without deep reflection, without any discussion or dialogue.
You will be treated in the same way if you openly say that it is nonsense and obvious absurdity to define father and mother as parent one and parent two or to define gender as something which is merely a matter of choice.
The molds of the so-called “political correctness” limit our right to ask questions and delegate topics of fundamental importance for our future and our societies.
However, this does not lessen our responsibility to oppose such intentions even more decisively.
And if we speak about freedom of choice then we, too, should be very vocal in promoting the traditional family pattern.
An equally important task is to understand the essence of radical individualism and self-sufficiency, which have become a trend throughout Europe, including our countries.
I believe that there lies at least a part of the answer to the question why many young people do not consider starting a family at all; which is why, year after year, there are fewer and fewer marriages, and more and more divorces.
It takes a lot of effort, will and dedication to answer these questions, and even more to offer adequate solutions. The fight for demographic renewal does not imply a battle on one front, but on multiple fronts.
Of course, it is important to offer the young people who want to start families an overall stimulating environment in society: stable economic conditions, well-paid jobs, well-organized health and educational systems and a peaceful and safe environment.
It is obviously also necessary that institutions create and implement effective pro-natal policies, in order to help young people to have their offspring.
But it is also necessary to revitalize the role of the family and promote its most beautiful values in public, culture and education.
It is important to show that starting a marriage and creating a family is not a burden, nor a rejection of personal comfort, but the progress of growth of each individual through the community.
I have met many wonderful, harmonious and successful multi-child families throughout the Republic of Srpska. I remember the words of a mother of eight children who jokingly, yet honestly, told me that it was much easier for her now with eight than it used to be with two children. The reason was that the older children had grown up in the meantime, so they took care of the youngest.
Meetings like this motivated me, while serving as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Srpska, to propose introducing a monthly salary for all unemployed new mothers where they exercise this right for 12 months, or 18 months for twins and every third and subsequent child. Families with one unemployed parent with four or more children in Republika Srpska are entitled to a monthly allowance as long as one of the children is a minor. As well, there are other measures to assist the family such as one-time assistance for the equipment of the newborn, free of charge procedures of in vitro fertilization, free textbooks for our primary school pupils, but also a subsidized interest rate on mortgages for young couples.
We are also very grateful to the Hungarian government for sharing their experiences with us at the time when we were improving our programme of pro-natal measures.
Hungary is a great example of a country that deals with the demographic issue in a serious and comprehensive way. It is exactly what this excellently organized, now already traditional, demographic summit testifies to.
It is very important that we talk about this topic, that we connect with each other and that we learn from each other.
We should be all aware that by neglecting the family we will neglect our demography and subsequently our future.
And we must never allow something like that to happen. This summit serves as a reminder of our duties to preserve the family and traditional values if we want to have a successful future for our countries.
Thank you for your attention!"

The Conference was addressed by member of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović, under whose auspices the International Conference ""30 years of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - Legacy and Challenges"" is held.
Dear mothers of Srebrenica, honourable guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
It is my pleasure to welcome you, as a member of BiH Presidency and patron, at the opening of the 5th international conference ""30 years of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - Legacy and Challenges"". I pay special respect to the brave and dignified women from the Association of ""Mothers of the Srebrenica and Žepa Enclaves"", and other associations of genocide victims and witnesses.
Today's conference is of great importance because it indicates the importance and results of the work of the Hague Tribunal, but also raises awareness in national and international frameworks about the importance of opposing ideologies and policies that lead to genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes.
On 25th of May, 1993, the United Nations Security Council (UN) established the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with the aim of stopping violations of international humanitarian law, as well as violations of the laws and customs of war.
The UN Security Council decided to establish an International Court with the exclusive task of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia from 1st of January, 1991, until a date determined by the Security Council after the re-establishment of peace, and with the adopted Resolution ordered the adoption of the Statute of the International Court.
The UN Security Council adopted a Resolution which determined that the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and primarily in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, represents a threat to international peace and security. With this resolution, the UN Security Council expressed its determined intention to stop such crimes and to take effective measures to bring the persons responsible for them to justice. Namely, the UN Security Council was convinced that as an ad hoc measure, the establishment of an international court and the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law would contribute to the establishment and maintenance of peace.
With the establishment of the Hague Tribunal, a clear position was taken - the prosecution of persons responsible for committing war crimes is of essential importance for the entire international community, but also for each country individually.
We are witnessing that, unfortunately, international armed conflicts continue to occur; all those who threaten or use force contrary to the UN Charter, should be aware that they will be held accountable for the crimes committed, and that they will be brought before the competent court authorities to determine objective facts about the legal nature of given conflicts.
By establishing the Tribunal, the international community encouraged the development of international criminal law and pushed forward the idea of ending impunity for serious violations of the Geneva Conventions, laws and customs of war, genocide and crimes against humanity. Through its work, the Tribunal, just like the Mechanism, gave the victims the opportunity to have their voices heard, which actualized the issue of the victim's position in modern criminal proceedings.
The establishment of the ICTY had legal, historical, civilizational and moral significance.
The tribunal was the first international criminal court formed after the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals that prosecuted criminals after the Second World War.
The Hague Tribunal left behind a huge archive of the genocide committed against Bosniaks, crimes against humanity and other crimes. Among other things, the legacy of The Hague consists of: 2.5 million transcripts of court proceedings, 422,000 documents and 30,000 videos. 10,800 trial days were held at the Hague Tribunal, and over 4,600 witnesses testified.
In total, almost 1,500 years of imprisonment and seven life sentences were imposed. The tribunal did not judge nations but determined individual responsibility.
Politicians from neighbouring countries, as well as some from Bosnia and Herzegovina, must learn from the judgments of the ICTY. They must understand that the policy of force, aggression and crime does not pay off and that there are always mechanisms that sanction such policies.
The truth about the committed genocide and the legacy of the Hague Tribunal remain a permanent reminder to humanity.
The ICTY's legacy of civilization is that some of the highest officials responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes were brought to justice. The bringing before the Hague Tribunal of the presidents, generals, camp commanders and other responsible persons exceeded the initial expectations from the beginning of the work of this international ad hoc court.
With the decisions concerning the genocide committed against Bosniaks, crimes against humanity and other war crimes, the ICTY showed that the high position of an individual cannot be a protection against criminal prosecution.
The tribunal also confirmed the legal nature of the war waged against the internationally recognised state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The final verdicts of the Hague Tribunal, including the verdicts on joint criminal enterprises, have proven that this was an international armed conflict. Neighbouring states fought a war for territories with the aim of creating a greater Serbia, and in one period of the war, a greater Croatia.
Unfortunately, despite the verdicts of the ICTY and the International Court of Justice, we are still witnessing the anti-civilization activities of some politicians who deny genocide and glorify war criminals.
We must not underestimate the danger of politicians who follow the ideology and politics of criminals. Neither we in Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor the international community.
After thirty years of work of the Tribunal (and the Mechanism), we have new tasks before us: telling the truth and maintaining a culture of remembrance.
In order to be able to perform that task, it is necessary to start from the objective facts established in the proceedings before the Tribunal. No matter how painful and difficult they are, we must start from them, because only those can represent the basis for the establishment of a stable and prosperous society. Lies, manipulations and glorification of criminal policies and ideologies do not lead in the right direction.
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Hague Tribunal, allow me to remind you that I requested that the UN bring a just solution and that the complete original archive of the Hague Tribunal be stored in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Namely, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the beginning of this year I asked the UN Secretary General, the President of the UN General Assembly and the President of the Residual Mechanism for Criminal Courts to store the archives of the Hague Tribunal in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Millions of printed pages, audio recordings, videos, photographs, political agreements and secret data, which clearly confirm what happened during the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should be stored in Sarajevo. That is the only fair solution.
Respecting the verdicts of the highest courts of the UN, I think it is important to state the following:
- Verdicts of the Hague Tribunal are of capital importance for the entire international law and order. Among other things, the verdicts of the highest courts of the UN established that genocide against Bosniaks and joint criminal enterprises against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina were committed.
- The highest courts of the UN have permanently condemned the larger-state ideologies and policies that tried to divide and destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent, sovereign, indivisible and internationally recognized state.
- The international community and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina have a legal, political, moral and historical obligation to the victims and future generations to request a revision of the criminal legislation in the countries of the region in order to adequately prosecute and punish all those who deny court verdicts and who glorify convicted war criminals.
- The international community should not allow the final judgments of the courts of the United Nations to be archived and then forgotten.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina has the right to demand that the international community, in the interest of all humanity, send a message that the results of committed genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes must not be permanently recognized.
- Justice cannot be achieved without a serious and responsible approach to solving the problems of the past, and there can be no serious approach without the application of transitional justice mechanisms.
Finally, I would like to end today's address with a message:
30 years of the history of the Hague Tribunal (the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - ICTY and its legal successor the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Courts - IRMCC) are behind us. Based on the judgments of this tribunal, we must continue our common journey towards justice and truth. There is no any other way for us.
Thank you for your attention!"
98768,"Address of the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the meeting of leaders of the Brdo",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98768&langTag=en-US,2023-09-11,"Dear colleagues, Ladies and gentlemen! I thank you for the invitation to participate in this forum. I especially thank the President of North Macedonia, Stevo Pendarovski, for the warm welcome here in Skopje. The Brdo - Brijuni process is an important platform for the improvement of regional cooperation and dialogue, but also for the promotion of European values and perspectives.
The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the Constitution, laws and other relevant state documents.
They clearly state that we stand for respect for international law and the fundamental principles on which interstate relations are based.
Bosnia and Herzegovina acts in accordance with obligations from concluded and accepted agreements and other international instruments, as well as membership in international organizations and associations.
The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina pays particular importance to the strengthening of regional cooperation.
The state policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards neighbouring and other countries is based on:
- respecting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states;
- equality in interstate relations;
- ban of interventions in the internal and external affairs of other states;
- resolving open issues through interstate dialogue;
- respecting the principles of peaceful and good neighbourly cooperation.
Regional cooperation in general, in the bilateral and multilateral sense, is an important aspect of strengthening stability and security. By active participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in regional initiatives, we want to position Bosnia and Herzegovina as a proactive and constructive partner.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to provide concrete support to regional cooperation, including the Brdo-Brijuni process initiative, again emphasizing the importance of the Thessaloniki Agenda for EU membership and the accelerated implementation of the Berlin process.
Reflections of the global quakes are felt to a great extent in this part of Europe as well.
We are witnessing profound political, economic and social changes, both in the region itself and internationally.
Russian aggression against Ukraine is the biggest geopolitical earthquake of enormous proportions. It is not only a war against Ukraine, but also a dangerous threat to the entire democratic and free world.
Unfortunately, a new iron curtain has been drawn again, dividing the world into states that respect the universal principles of the United Nations and human dignity, and states that do not respect human rights. We need to direct our countries according to democratic values, standards and principles.
The countries of Southeast Europe are facing a huge test.
The representatives of these countries decide whether the 21st century in this part of Europe will be the century of peace and development or the century of new disasters. No catastrophe in the last century has bypassed us. Let us do everything in our power to avoid in the 21st century the tragedies of the previous century.
Let us collectively learn from the past, especially the tragic 1990s, and look towards the future. Let us open room for projects that bring economic and any other progress.
One of the prerequisites for more successful cooperation in the region is the respect for the following principle: Anything we do not want to happen in our countries, we do not do it to others. When we implement this principle, we will reduce a large number of problems.
Important questions are before us: How to move forward? What to do? What to offer people living in our region?
To begin with, let us offer a vision of the region of the XXI century. Let us show the good way in these turbulent times.
We strive to build democratic and free states, members of the European and Euro-Atlantic family of countries, in which different identities - national, ethnic, religious, regional, social and other - are freely developed and respected, but in which the common European identity is also respected.
It is a vision of economically and institutionally developed countries, oriented towards cooperation, development, peace, with societies based on knowledge.
Let us explain to the people of the region that our diversity is an asset and an advantage, not a curse and a weakness.
Let us establish educational systems that will raise young generations for peace and tolerance, not for conflict and hatred.
As states that respect and cooperate with each other, we have a chance for progress in the 21st century, confronted, we are condemned to stagnation.
We should not seek an alibi for our failures in others. Let us apply the Scandinavian model of cooperation, not the Balkan one. Our future is in our hands.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports projects that contribute to development and strengthen the living standards of citizens.
Let us use the Energy Support Package of the European Union (EU) to help the countries of the Western Balkans in solving the energy crisis.
Improving energy efficiency and building capacity in response to climate change, such as the recent major floods in Slovenia and Croatia, are common challenges facing the entire region and the EU itself and as such require our unified approach.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to participate in the energy transition towards green energy sources. In this regard, the EU's help in a just energy transition is very important to us, and will reduce the social impact.
Our goal is to intensify work on the development of the transport network and the completion of the construction of corridor 5c, as well as the start of work on the Adriatic-Ionian road through Bosnia and Herzegovina. We all need to work together on infrastructural, energy and economic connection of the countries of the Western Balkans with the EU.
The membership of the countries of the Western Balkans in the EU represents an irreplaceable framework for strengthening peace and stability in Europe.
We have taken on the obligation to harmonize the common foreign and security policy with the EU. We must respect that obligation and show that we are credible partners.
I believe that the voices of the highest EU officials who advocate not only the acceleration of the European integration process, but also a different approach to the enlargement process are important and encouraging. Such an approach, which I fully support, implies easier access to the EU structural and cohesion funds for countries in the enlargement process, as well as greater participation in the work of the EU institutions. This is the best way to reduce the economic gap with the EU, build infrastructure, create jobs and reduce the departure of young people.
Let us permanently close the Balkan Pandora's box.
Attempts to redraw and draw new state borders are the greatest source of evil and unhappiness. We have seen that such attempts result in great suffering. Let us learn something from our past. Instead of dangerous ideas about border changes, let us turn to economic development and true friendly cooperation.
Thank you for your attention!"
98737,The Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović delivered a speech on the topic of ‘The Western Balkans in Regional and European Integration’ at the 32nd Economic Forum i,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98737&langTag=en-US,2023-09-07,"Distinguished Excellencies, Dear colleagues and friends, Let me first congratulate the hosts for the excellent organization of this prestigious gathering and express my deepest gratitude for the opportunity to briefly address you on the topic of “The Western Balkans in Regional and European Integration.”
I hope I will be able to shed some additional light on the important issues confronting the Western Balkans, both in the context of the region’s common European perspective and in the context of the mutual relations of our countries, including some open issues that burden the overall political, economic and security situation in the Western Balkans.
As we all know, in the last 18 months the world has experienced tremendous geopolitical changes and challenges. And the countries of the Western Balkans, of course, are not immune to these challenges and the crises they have brought to Europe.
In addition, the countries of our region have been struggling with their own longstanding problems. The reasons for this can be found in the geopolitical position of the Western Balkans, and its ethnic, religious, cultural, and political complexity.
One could rightly say that the growing democratic capacities of the countries in our region have not been sufficient to overcome the various problems that are manifested both within our countries and in our mutual relations.
The heavy involvement of the international factor has not helped either, and it seems that international interventions have quite often complicated rather than reduced the accumulated problems, hostilities, and misunderstandings we are dealing with.
On the positive side, all our countries share common aspirations when it comes to the process of European integration and the goal of full membership in the European Union.
On the negative side, however, some EU countries have little understanding of our above-mentioned regional complexities. This lack of understanding in many situations makes the EU’s approach inadequate, and often promotes double standards in how it deals with these complexities. Some EU countries promote political or constitutional practices in our countries which they would never accept in their own home countries.
Another problem we are dealing with in the Western Balkans is that our own European perspective has been in a form of limbo for the past twenty years. Some countries in the region have become EU candidate states in the past two decades but still have no clear timetable for when they can become members. Consequently, across the region there has been a loss of confidence in the belief that any of the states in the region will ever be granted membership status.
Thus, it should come as no surprise that we now hear many voices warn that the “EU perspective” will never turn into actual membership, not only because of our own internal burdens, but also because the EU is pretending that these burdens will in some miraculous way disappear by themselves.
On the other hand, we hear some voices claim that the EU’s ambivalence about accepting the Western Balkans countries as full members is changing under the new geopolitical circumstances of the past eighteen months, and that the accession process for the Western Balkan countries will now be accelerated.
How the EU ultimately resolves this dilemma will depend largely upon whether it decides to see the Western Balkans as an added value to the union, or merely as a future burden.
Whatever the outcome, I want to use this opportunity to thank Poland, its president and government, for their support in the process of the EU granting candidate status to B&H in December of last year.
We understand that the recent decisions to grant candidate status for certain countries emanated from the new geopolitical situation, and that these decisions were not based on the actual records of any of the new candidate countries, which are of course carefully monitored by the EU.
As for Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, after obtaining candidate status we have continued to work towards fulfilling our obligations from the package of fourteen priorities Brussels set out for the country. Some EU officials are signaling that the accession talks might be set to begin at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. But we are aware that some in Brussels do not share this view.
Unfortunately, the countries of our region have already experienced many such contradictions, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an exception. Another such example is certainly Northern Macedonia, which has encountered various bilateral and multilateral obstacles while waiting to start negotiations with the EU.
Let me remind you that one of the requirements the EU has set before us is the issue of regional cooperation. Therefore, various bilateral and multilateral arrangements have been developed in the region dealing with everything from trade to political and security cooperation. Most of them are initiated by international actors and imply their participation, coordination, and monitoring.
It is fair to say that such initiatives have had a positive impact, as they have helped us increase trade throughout the region, gradually establishing a single market in the Western Balkans.
These initiatives have also led to different forms of police and security cooperation and have promoted increased freedom of movement; for instance, the recognition of diplomas and professional qualification for people across the region has significantly increased freedom of movement for our labor forces.
This cooperation is evident. However, it still cannot hide the fact that in the Western Balkans there remain many open issues and serious problems that have their own specific historical and political dimensions.
Given the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where its democratic institutional capacity and sovereignty are practically usurped by certain foreign centers of power or the recent violent developments and hostilities toward the Serb population by the Prishtina regime in the northern part of Kosovo and Metohija I can freely say that internationally driven political initiatives or tools have been unfair, inadequate, and have promoted double standards.
This has resulted in a growing sense that since the wars in the former Yugoslavia international actors not only have failed to find adequate modalities for the resolution of the region’s problems but have also quite often exacerbated these problems.
For instance, Bosnia and Herzegovina is recognized as a candidate country for EU membership, but at the same time its sovereignty is severely limited due to the continued existence of the Office of High Representative and of foreign judges on its Constitutional Court—twenty-eight years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords.
Please allow me to put the absurdity of this situation into an historical and comparative context for you. International supervision was ended, and sovereignty was returned to Germany and Japan ten years after the end of World War II. International supervision was ended, and sovereignty was returned to the Iraqi government and people two years after the invasion of Iraq, even though that country was in the midst of a full-scale civil war.
Yet in Bosnia and Herzegovina, almost three decades after the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, a foreign bureaucrat imposed on the country by outsiders—whom the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have had no role in choosing—still claims to have the right to arbitrarily impose laws and remove democratically-elected public officials from office.
This neo-colonial arrangement is an embarrassment to the values and ideals of twenty-first century Europe, and it is an embarrassment for a country that has been granted EU candidate country status.
Indeed, the arbitrary and malign constitutional and political interventions of various high representatives have so often proven detrimental and counter-productive for political processes in our country that former high representatives themselves now say that the OHR is part of the problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is not part of the solution.
None of us should be under any illusions on this issue. Real, genuine, and organic democratization and progress in Bosnia & Herzegovina is impossible as long as the anachronistic institution of the so-called “Office of the High Representative” continues to exist.
The sooner the OHR is closed down, the sooner Bosnia & Herzegovina can begin evolving into a stable, multiethnic and democratic polity, and the quicker we can begin fulfilling our EU accession requirements.
Postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina has also experienced serious security problems as a result of the Islamist radicalization that has occurred within some segments of its population. Numerous Al Qaeda and ISIS cells were established in Bosnia & Herzegovina during and after the war, and as the various terrorist attacks with Bosnian connections carried out across Europe over the past twenty-five years attest—from the Madrid Train Bombings in 2004 to the Vienna terrorist attack just a couple of years ago—both the region and Europe as a whole, are still threatened by this dangerous problem.
In conclusion, I want to end on an optimistic note. As I have argued, the Western Balkans are a sensitive, fragile area, burdened with different challenges and problems. But this was also true of much of Western Europe seventy-five years ago.
In the case of Western Europe, however, enlightened, intelligent, and sensitive policies helped transform historic enemies into stable and cooperative allies. I believe the same transformation can occur in the Western Balkans if international policy towards the region shows the same degree of enlightenment, intelligence, and sensitivity that the founders of the European Community and so much of the post-World War II international order showed in those years.
The challenge at this moment is to make EU and international policy towards the region more realistic, and more sensitive to the historic complexities we are trying to overcome.
Thank you once again for your time and for your attention."
98686,"Speech by the Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željka Cvijanović, at the commemoration of the Day of the Missing Persons and the Dead in the Defence-Fatherland (Patriotic) War",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98686&langTag=en-US,2023-08-30,"Dear All! We have gathered today to remember all those who died and went missing in the Patriotic War. To those to whom we owe eternal gratitude for the freedom they won together with their comrades. For their sake, as well as for our own sake, we are obliged to defend this freedom in peace and leave it to future generations. The freedom I am talking about is called Republika Srpska.
And today we are not at Ozren by chance.
This mountain is a symbol of the suffering of the Serb people in the past war.
The NATO aggression against Republika Srpska, which began on this very day, 28 years ago, contributed to this suffering and the exodus of Serbs from these areas.
Ozren is a place of pain, suffering and brutal crimes committed by members of the El-Mujahedeen squad.
Those monsters - who lived thousands of kilometres away from Bosnia and Herzegovina - are respected today in Sarajevo as heroes and defenders.
And their victims, the Serbs from Ozren who have lived here for centuries, they call aggressors and criminals without any shame.
It is about the complete absence of all logic, morality, and common sense.
Twenty-eight years after the end of the war, Republika Srpska is still searching for 1,646 missing persons, soldiers and civilians, among who are more than 300 women and children.
They are not a number or a statistic, but someone's children, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, whose families deserve they be found.
The process of searching for missing persons of Serb nationality has been so flawed, slow and shameful for years that I absolutely understand the anger and indignation of their families.
The ignorant attitude of the Institute for Missing Persons of BiH towards the families of missing Serbs is no less shameful.
It is their professional and human obligation to treat everyone equally and not to favour or ignore anyone based on nationality.
The same is the case in many other institutions at the joint level, and we are fighting against it in every place.
It is precisely the effort of Bosniak representatives to privatize BiH institutions that is the key reason for its failure.
In previous years, I have had numerous conversations with representatives of the families of dead and missing persons.
The long-term struggle they lead, seeking justice and their loved ones, is not only theirs, but the struggle of all of us.
It is a struggle for dignity and equality that the Constitution and the Dayton Peace Agreement guaranteed to the Serb people and Republika Srpska.
No one gifted that to us, but your loved ones fought and won it.
That is why we will always be by your side and with you.
That is why your fight will never be yours alone, but ours together.
In the institutions of Republika Srpska, as before, you will always have support.
This is also our institutional obligation, but it is, above all, a human duty.
Thank you."

As the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is my honour to participate in the Third Summit of the Crimean Platform and send from this place a clear and unambiguous message of support to the Ukrainian people in the fight to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, which, of course, includes Crimea. Crimea is Ukraine!
I come from a country that has also been a victim of aggression and attempts to forcibly seize its territory. As in the case of Ukraine, the military aggression of a far stronger and larger military power towards Bosnia and Herzegovina was preceded by political, media, economic, and any other aggression, including cultural ones - an attempt to deny the cultural identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its peoples, presenting them as fictional , regardless of the thousand-year history of Bosnian statehood.
Even the circumstances of the aggression against Ukraine and my country are similar. In February 1992, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted in a referendum choosing an independent and sovereign, multi-ethnic, democratic, European Bosnia and Herzegovina. That democratic expression of the will of the vast majority of the citizens of my country was met by aggression, ethnic cleansing, camps, genocide in Srebrenica and the siege of the capital Sarajevo.
While we followed the events in Kiev at the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, when the Verkhovna Rada and the citizens of Ukraine sent a clear message through democratic means that they wanted to tear their country out of its vassal relationship with Russia, and direct it towards the free part of the world and the European Union, we feared we are facing a similar scenario that we experienced twenty years earlier - illegal aggression and attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory. These acts were a clear violation of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, as well as the Treaty of Friendship between Russia and Ukraine.
Unfortunately, the seizure of Crimea, followed by ethnic cleansing and numerous other violations of human rights and freedoms, was only a prelude to the continuation of the aggression that followed in February 2022. This time, the goal of the aggressors was and remains the overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian authorities, the submission of the Ukrainian people to the regime in the Kremlin.
Together, we must resist such intentions and protect the basic principles of international law and order, on which the security, stability and prosperity of the entire world depend. The inviolability of state borders, as well as the political independence of sovereign countries, must be collectively protected. There must be no compromise on these matters. Defending its right to exist and be free, Ukraine today pays a huge price for defending those basic principles. That is why we must be loud and clear in supporting Ukraine and condemning the aggressors.
Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!"""

It is my honour to address you today, on the occasion of the Independence Day of Ukraine. On this day, 32 years ago, the free citizens of Ukraine restored their independence. The fate of Ukraine finally belonged to its people.
We cannot fully celebrate today's holiday because Russia's unjust, unjustified and illegal aggression against your country continues. As we speak here, brave Ukrainian soldiers are defending the country on the lines and bleeding to reclaim Ukrainian land under temporary Russian occupation. Along with the soldiers, millions of Ukrainians are working hard to contribute to Ukraine's victory - factory workers, computer specialists, farmers, teachers, doctors, they all continue to work to keep the heart of this country beating stronger every day.
Your government, led by President Zelenskyy, has not only worked hard to respond to the enormous current dangers. It has taken bold steps to secure a European future for your country. Obtaining candidate status for membership in the European Union is the clearest sign of where Ukraine's future lies - among free, stable and prosperous European countries.
People around the world, including myself, are amazed and inspired by the indestructible Ukrainian spirit. Your fight to preserve your territories, your independence and freedom, is nothing short of heroic. It reminds us every day how fragile peace and freedom are, how hard we have to fight every day to preserve our democracy and independence.
Supporting Ukraine in this historic struggle goes far beyond the narrow interests of geopolitics. What is at the heart of this struggle is the preservation of the most basic human values - the desire to be free, to be safe and to have own identity. These principles are unbreakable even when defended with bare hands. About these values, there must be no calculations.
I am encouraged by the global support that Ukraine has received since the beginning of the aggression. But now is the time to expand and strengthen that support. With each new day, Ukraine becomes stronger, the aggressor weaker, more desperate, but also more dangerous. His downfall must be hastened.
The free people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are with Ukraine. We know very well everything about the horrors of war, aggression, destruction and war crimes. By witnessing the struggles of Ukraine, we are reminded of our own recent armed struggle, but also of today's challenges of attempts to destroy our country, its institutions and its unique identity.
As you fight for your country and its future, be wary of compromises that may threaten in peace what you so bravely defended in war. Make sure you achieve peace on your own terms, because the future of your country depends on it.
As I said at the beginning, this Independence Day cannot be fully celebrated because the aggression against Ukraine continues. But we can certainly celebrate Ukraine's indomitable spirit, knowing that in the end Ukraine will win. No one should have any doubts that the heroic and patriotic struggle of forty-four million Ukrainians will ever be defeated.
I congratulate Independence Day to you, with the wish for just, lasting peace and prosperity. Glory to Ukraine!"""

""The first strategy is a strategy of redirecting attention. There is a targeted attempt to divert people's attention from fatefully important issues to unimportant ones. They try to flood people with irrelevant information so that they don't think about crucial things important for the preservation of the state.
The second strategy is to destroy the state gradually, month by month, year by year. The planners of this strategy know that the sudden collapse of the state would cause strong resistance, and that is why they want to implement their goals through years of attrition and a policy of small steps. Their intention is to imperceptibly, in peace, destroy the country, without the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina being aware of the tectonic changes.
The third strategy is to purposefully cause confusion, to present enemies as friends and friends as enemies. We must recognize this and not allow this vicious hoax.
The fourth strategy is the political, psychological and media acclimatization of people to the project of dividing the state. The public is systematically trying to prepare itself to calmly and without resistance accept the cataclysm of the destruction of the state.
The fifth strategy is the abuse of emotions, with the aim of making rational judgment impossible. An approach is deliberately imposed in which we need to replace critical awareness with emotional impulses (anger, fear, etc.).
The sixth strategy is based on strong media indoctrination so that people do not understand the mechanisms of manipulation and the extent of the danger. The goal of this strategy is to keep people as ignorant as possible, so that it is easier to implement manipulative steps.
The seventh strategy is creating an environment of insecurity, apathy and pessimism. They are trying to disgust us with everything that is Bosnian. The anti-Bosnian power centres want us to renounce our history, our culture, our religion, our language, our country, our heroes...
The eighth strategy is to discredit all relevant forces and individuals who defend the state. The goal of this strategy is to expose all BiH. patriots to a strong attack from the outside, and at the same time to have installed individuals from the inside who equalize the responsibility of those who destroy and defend the state. It is not by chance that we have a series of texts discrediting the Bosnian cadres. It is part of a dangerous project.
The ninth strategy is to cause disunity and fragmentation of the forces fighting for the preservation of the state. That is why the most panic is caused by calls for pro-state forces to gather in the fight for issues of capital importance for the state.
Why did I talk about these nine dangerous strategies? We have to warn people about this hellish plan. We must truly inform, make aware, connect and activate people. Only with the state do we have a secure future.""
The entire speech of the member of BiH Presidency, Dr Denis Bećirović can be found below:
Dear fighters of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
respected relatives of shaheeds and fallen fighters,
respected representatives of veterans' associations,
Citizens of Cazin,
respected mayor and friend Nermin Ogrešević!
The Day of the City of Cazin is an important date not only for Cazin, but also for the entire Krajina and the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The sixth of August is the Day of the city of Cazin, but also the date when we celebrate the anniversary of the breaking of the blockade of the Bihać district after 1,201 days of brutal aggressor's blockade. It is a date that has a special place in the hearts of all people who love Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Cazin is a city of heroes, a city of virtuous and hardworking people. In the last ten years, it has developed from a small Bosnian town into a modern European city that the entire Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina are proud of.
Today, from Cazin, I want to send a message that there is no trade with the homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina is sacred.
There are no dilemmas: state or people, state or religion, state or party, state or family. The state must be in front and above everything. Why am I saying this? Because without the state, we will not preserve the people, religion, parties, or families.
The state is not just a mere bureaucratic apparatus, it is something more, more substantial and existential. For us, it is the fundamental assumption of freedom and survival.
It is time for all political entities to understand this. The sooner the better.
Our country does not need one-time, but long-term and statesmanlike messages.
We must dethrone stupidity, naivety, vanities, and the insatiable desire for power.
It is time to recognize the mother of Bosnia and Herzegovina's history and let it be our inspiration to come up with the best solutions.
We must overcome all that numbs our caution and strength.
The citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina need the truth, because half-truths and untruths destroy the present and threaten the future.
Accepting a historical lie is a crime in peace! The principles of defence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were absolutely opposite to the aggressor's concept of ethnic persecution, mass war crimes and genocide. They were based on the fight for the human rights of every person and the construction of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state of equal citizens and nations.
Civilizational, legal and moral distinctions between those who defended and those who attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina are clear to anyone who wants to face the facts. Legal and illegal, democratic and criminal, civilized and anti-civilized cannot and must not be equated.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is under attack from nine dangerous strategies of lies and manipulation.
The first strategy is a strategy of redirecting attention. There is a targeted attempt to divert people's attention from fatefully important issues to unimportant ones. They try to flood people with irrelevant information so that they don't think about crucial things important for the preservation of the state.
The second strategy is to destroy the state gradually, month by month, year by year. The planners of this strategy know that the sudden collapse of the state would cause strong resistance, and that is why they want to implement their goals through years of attrition and a policy of small steps. Their intention is to imperceptibly, in peace, destroy the country, without the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina being aware of the tectonic changes.
The third strategy is to purposefully cause confusion, to present enemies as friends and friends as enemies. We must recognize this and not allow this vicious hoax.
The fourth strategy is the political, psychological and media acclimatization of people to the project of dividing the state. The public is systematically trying to prepare itself to calmly and without resistance accept the cataclysm of the destruction of the state.
The fifth strategy is the abuse of emotions, with the aim of making rational judgment impossible. An approach is deliberately imposed in which we need to replace critical awareness with emotional impulses (anger, fear, etc.).
The sixth strategy is based on strong media indoctrination so that people do not understand the mechanisms of manipulation and the extent of the danger. The goal of this strategy is to keep people as ignorant as possible, so that it is easier to implement manipulative steps.

The ninth strategy is to cause disunity and fragmentation of the forces fighting for the preservation of the state. That is why the most panic is caused by calls for pro-state forces to gather in the fight for issues of capital importance for the state.
Why did I talk about these nine dangerous strategies? We have to warn people about this hellish plan. We must truly inform, make aware, connect and activate people. Only with the state do we have a secure future.
In the turbulent times of undisguised threats to the constitutional order, we must be united in the defence of independent, sovereign and indivisible Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In normal political circumstances, it is desirable for political parties to compete in offering ideas, programs and projects for a better arrangement of internal contents in the state. However, at the time of direct and brutal attacks on the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is necessary to gather, connect and coordinate the activities of pro-Bosnian parties in a common front for the preservation of the homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We must completely subordinate party, group and individual interests to state interests. Personal, group, party or any particular animosities cannot and must not come before state interests.
Among the pro-Bosnian parties, there must be no division into position and opposition when deciding on capital issues such as: preservation and affirmation of the independence and sovereignty of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, protection of the territorial integrity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respect and affirmation of the principles of constitutionality and legality, unreserved support acceleration of the Euro-Atlantic integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina; promotion and assurance of human and civil freedoms.
We must make it clear to political extremists, as well as their mentors outside the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that we will respond institutionally, uniquely and decisively to any activity that threatens the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
What to do and how to move forward?
We need to start correcting the mistakes that have been building up for years and decades. It is not simple, but it is healing.
It is not a good practice that disempowers legal state bodies, and puts essential decision-making in the hands of party leaders and their headquarters.
It is not good for party leaders to talk in hotels while state bodies are not working.
It is not good for party leaders to turn parliaments and governments into flow boilers and not places of true decision-making.
Those are some of the mistakes we need to start correcting.
At the end of the address, let me underline, we will never give up on our homeland. Never!
May mercy be upon all the noble shaheeds of Bosnia and Herzegovina and may eternal memory be upon the fallen fighters of our defence and liberation war!
Let's protect our only homeland - Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Long live Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
98545,"Address by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the ceremonial academy on the occasion of the event of ""Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98545&langTag=en-US,2023-08-02,"Dear veterans of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected relatives of shaheeds and fallen fighters, respected representatives of veterans' associations, citizens of Sarajevo, Dear friends!
Today we have gathered here to pay our respects to the brave and honourable soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RBiH Army) who defended Igman, Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The battle for Igman is one of the biggest and most famous military victories of the soldiers of the RBiH Army. That victory was of decisive importance for the defence of the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for the defence of the entire country.
The heavily armed aggressor was defeated by the superhuman fight of the RBiH Army fighters. On Igman, it was confirmed that nothing in this world is stronger than people who defend their families and their homeland.
No one in the long history of our country has such a place as the RBiH Army. It is an authentic, unique and famous armed force that saved the country, the people and a thousand years of Bosnian history. We cannot and must not forget that.
Today, 31 years after the beginning of the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have the truth established by the courts.
We must remain silent on the truth. The highest courts of the United Nations proved that genocide against Bosniaks and aggression against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina was committed.
For decades, big-state power centres have been spreading lies about the civil war. Now, there are court rulings that it was not a civil war. It is about an international armed conflict and aggression against the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Joint criminal enterprises were conducted against our country during which genocide was committed against Bosniaks. However, the aggressors did not succeed. They failed thanks primarily to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army, whose heroism remains a permanent testimony of the honourable fight for the homeland.
Recently, the theory of equidistance has been promoted more and more often, which tries to equalize the role of the legal authorities of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the illegal authorities of parastatals.
Such attempts to level history are futile and doomed to failure. We must never fall into the trap of accepting baseless simplifications. Such an approach blurs the past, makes it difficult to understand the present and threatens the future.
The truth is a whole and without it there is no healthy communication between people and nations. The citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina need the truth, because half-truths and untruths destroy the present and threaten the future. It is of inestimable importance for the future of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina that we never allow the killing of the truth about the history of our country.
Accepting a historical lie is a crime in peace!
The principles of defence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were absolutely opposite to the aggressor's concept of ethnic persecution, mass war crimes and genocide. They were based on the fight for the human rights of every person and the construction of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state of equal citizens and nations.
The civilizational, legal and moral differences between the defenders of the state and those who attacked it are clear to anyone who wants to face the facts. Legal and illegal, humane and criminal, civilized and anti-civilized cannot and must not be equated.
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina is once again under attack by followers of big-state policies. We are again under the attack of anti-Bosnian propaganda.
There are many of us who are not ready to remain silent while the project of breaking up the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is being implemented before our own eyes.
Everyone who protects the state is the target of targeted media attacks. Such propaganda has been going on for decades. The time and the context are new, but the lies, subterfuge, and rigging are not new.
However, the enemies of Bosnia and Herzegovina must know: they will neither scare us nor stop us! We are not afraid of the followers of big state policies and we will fight against their project of destroying the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It's time to start understanding politics beyond daily-political, narrow-party and personal understandings.
It is time to act pragmatically and strategically. It is time to act within the scope of the possible, with an eye to the future. That is why we must pave the way to the future regardless of the attacks.
The great writer Dostoevsky said, ""If you set out for the goal and on the way start stopping and throwing stones at every dog that barks at you, you will never reach the goal.""
We will not waste energy on the mercenaries who attack us on a daily basis, we will continue the unstoppable movement towards our goal - a safe, modern and Euro-Atlantic Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is under attack from nine dangerous strategies of lies and manipulation.
The first strategy is a strategy of redirecting attention. There is a targeted attempt to divert people's attention from fatefully important issues to unimportant ones. They try to flood people with a flood of irrelevant information so that they don't think about crucial things important for the preservation of the state.
The second strategy is to destroy the state gradually, month by month, year by year. The planners of this strategy know that the sudden collapse of the state would cause strong resistance, and that is why they want to implement their goals through multi-year exhaustion and a policy of short steps. Their intention is to imperceptibly destroy the country in peace, without the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina being aware of the tectonic changes.
The third strategy is to purposefully cause confusion, to present enemies as friends and friends as enemies. We must recognize this and not allow this wickedness
The fourth strategy is the political, psychological and media acclimatization of people to the project of dividing the state. The public is systematically trying to prepare itself to calmly and without resistance accept the cataclysm of the destruction of the state.
The fifth strategy is the abuse of emotions in order to prevent rational judgment. An approach is deliberately imposed in which we need to replace critical awareness with emotional impulses (anger, fear, etc.).
The sixth strategy is based on strong media indoctrination, so that people do not understand the mechanisms of manipulation and the extent of the danger. The goal of this strategy is to keep people as ignorant as possible so that it is easier to implement manipulation steps.
The seventh strategy is creating an environment of insecurity, apathy and pessimism. They are trying to disgust us with everything that is Bosnian. The anti-Bosnian power centres want us to renounce our history, our culture, our religion, our language, our country, our heroes...
The eighth strategy is to discredit all relevant forces and individuals who defend the state. The goal of this strategy is to expose all BiH patriots to a strong attack from the outside, and at the same time to have installed individuals from the inside who equalize the responsibility of those who destroy and defend the state. It is no coincidence that we have a series of commissioned texts that discredit the Bosnian cadres. It's part of a dangerous project.
The ninth strategy is to cause disunity among the forces fighting for the preservation of the state. That is why the most panic is caused by calls for pro-state forces to gather in the fight for issues of capital importance for the state.
Why did I talk about these nine dangerous strategies? We have to warn people about this hellish plan. We must truly inform, make aware, connect and activate people. Only with the state do we have a secure future.
We will never forget the sacrifice of the shaheeds and fallen soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will teach new generations about it.
We will never give up our homeland.
We will never forget the best sons and daughters of our homeland.
They are a beacon that will permanently illuminate our honourable path of struggle for the homeland.
May mercy be upon all the noble shaheeds of Bosnia and Herzegovina and may eternal memory be upon the fallen fighters of our defence and liberation war!
Let us love and protect our only homeland - Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Long live Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
98365,"Address of the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the commemoration of the 28th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks in the ""Safe Zone of",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98365&langTag=en-US,2023-07-11,"Respected families of genocide victims, citizens of Srebrenica, Podrinje and Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected Excellencies, respected brothers and sisters!
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the entire civilized part of the world, show deep respect for the victims of the only genocide in Europe after the Second World War.
Today we are here to say that we must never stop spreading the truth about the committed genocide against Bosniaks.
We will never give in to the politics and ideology of evil. We will not do it for the sake of the dead and those alive
It is our permanent human and civilizational obligation to find the strength and wisdom to speak about the committed genocide.
We must pay special respect to the Mothers of Srebrenica.
They have been tirelessly and courageously fighting for the truth and justice for twenty-eight years. These brave women deserve the highest possible recognition and respect.
They truly deserved to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
A culture of memory strengthens truth and justice.
With the culture of memory, we oppose the culture of lies, the culture of denying crimes and genocide.
The culture of memory is the only way out of the spiral of violence and evil, the only way to heal society from the disease of hatred. That's why the choice is simple: either the culture of memory or the repetition of evil.
All those who offer Bosnia and Herzegovina a strategy of oblivion do not think well to our country. We must never agree to an institutional reckoning with memory. We must never consent to the erasure of memories.
The highest courts of the United Nations (UN) proved that genocide against Bosniaks and aggression against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina were committed.
There was no civil war in our country, as some wanted to portray it. It was an international armed conflict. Brutal aggression was committed against the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Joint criminal enterprises were conducted against our country during which genocide was committed against Bosniaks.
These are the facts that cannot be hidden or erased. These are permanent condemnations of the criminal large-state projects of breaking up Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Judgments of the International Court of Justice and The Hague Tribunal do not exist to be archived. They must be read in detail, analysed and implemented. Let us not forget that these are a part of binding international law.
The United Nations has admitted their mistake towards Bosnia and Herzegovina and Srebrenica.
Through the inaction and omissions of the UN, according to their own admission, they bear part of the responsibility for the genocide committed against the Bosniaks. The UN Secretary General's report on Srebrenica from 2000 clearly states:
""Through mistakes, bad decisions and the inability to recognize the evil that opposed us, we failed to fulfil our duty and help save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass killing (...) The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt us forever"".
Bearing in mind the public recognition of the responsibility and mistakes of the UN by the Secretary General of this organization, the verdicts of the highest courts of the UN, the adopted resolutions of the European Union, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia and numerous other countries, today I publicly ask the following questions:
Why are the mistakes made not corrected? Why is it allowed to pour salt on the wounds of the families of genocide victims? Why are those who deny the genocide against Bosniaks not sanctioned? Why are some representatives of the international community once again taking the path of yielding to policies that have been condemned by the courts as joint criminal enterprises?
Well-meaning people all over the world expect answers to these and similar questions because neither these questions nor the answers to them refer only to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
What we say today is not only directed towards the past but also towards the future.
When we talk about genocide, we must answer essential questions: Why was it committed? What are the motives? Who are the ideologues, planners and organizers? What is at the core of politics that committed genocide? Among the important questions, the following question arises: can the genocide against Bosniaks be repeated? To answer this question, we must compare the policies that led to the genocide in 1995 and the policies that threaten us again. So I will publicly ask and answer the following nine questions:
1. Do we again have politicians who speak publicly and work on the realization of the criminal project of Greater Serbia? The answer is - yes.
2. Do we again have politicians who threaten the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina? The answer is - yes.
3. Do we again have politicians who deny and attack the ethnic, religious and linguistic identity of Bosniaks? The answer is - yes.
4. Do we once again have politicians on the scene who openly destroy the constitutional order of the country? The answer is - yes.
5. Do we again have targeted attempts of political, media, intelligence and other forms of discrediting and demonizing Bosniaks? The answer is - yes.
6. Do we again have those who are insulting victims and glorifying criminals? The answer is - yes.
7. Do we have a repetition of dangerous media propaganda that discredits all those who defend the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina? The answer is - yes.
8. Do we again have those working on the demilitarization of Bosnia and Herzegovina while the neighbours are arming themselves to the teeth? The answer is - yes.
9. Are there again among us those who do not see and do not know what danger is looming over Bosnia and Herzegovina? The answer is - yes.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The danger of repeating the genocide against Bosniaks has not been removed. Ideologies, policies, media, large-state power centres, large-state pretensions and other factors that led to the genocide against Bosniaks in the 90s are again present and threatening again.
What to do in Bosnia and Herzegovina?
We have to take special care of three elements.
The first is the strengthening of state-building awareness and politics. It is high time that we understand that the state must be at the top of the pyramid of values. Without the state, we will not preserve any other value.
The second element is the need for unity around strategic state issues.
And the third relates to the strengthening of the defence and security system. Only people who are willing, ready and equipped command the respect of the perpetrators of genocide. It is a lesson we must learn well.
A necessary step to resist the mindless attempt to collapse the Dayton Peace Agreement is to gather around strategic national issues that must be above personal, group and party interests.
We must all be aware that an unprecedented attack on the constitutional order of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is underway. The foundations of the Dayton Peace Agreement were attacked. The peace process was attacked. An attempt to destroy the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina is underway.
All democratic and patriotic forces must gather together under the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Disunity due to functions and pieces of government can lead to much bigger troubles. Political quarrels and failed forms of political action are not allies of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
All political parties that recognize and respect the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina should jointly and resolutely protect the fundamental values of civilization and Bosnia and Herzegovina, defend the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the final decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Difficult challenges and the expected continuation of dangerous attacks on Bosnia and Herzegovina will inevitably, sooner or later, force all relevant political actors to subordinate party interests to state interests, in the interest of more effective protection of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The centuries behind us have carved Bosnia and Herzegovina as a common state of citizens and nations.
Every road in our country is a common road.
And the road to evil is a road to common evil and the road to good is a common road to good.
We are a country where there is no selective path.
So let's condemn evil and at the same time build a common path to the future.
Our path to the future is connected with membership in NATO and the EU.
That path is complex and attacked.
However, it is the path that has no alternative."
98293,"Address of the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the commemoration on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks in the ""United Natio",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98293&langTag=en-US,2023-07-05,"Dear representatives of the Parliament and Government of His Royal Majesty, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends!
First of all, I want to express my gratitude on behalf of myself and the vast majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Government and Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) for the principled struggle to preserve the truth about the genocide committed against Bosniaks.
I express my sincere gratitude to the chairman of the ""Remembering Srebrenica"" Foundation, Waqar Azmi, and to my appreciated friends from this foundation.
I would also like to pay my respects to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Lord Paddy Ashdown, who are no longer with us, and who, during the aggression against the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, demanded the just action of the international community.
Lord Paddy Ashdown, as a high representative of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will forever remain inscribed in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europe as a man who persistently and strongly fought to overcome the consequences of aggression and genocide. This diplomat and humanist will remain inscribed in capital letters in the history of our two countries.
I also express my gratitude to the Government of the United Kingdom for their contribution to the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and the support for the Euro-Atlantic path of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina highly appreciate the engagement of the United Kingdom, which in 2015 proposed to the United Nations Security Council (UN) Resolution S/2015/508 on Srebrenica.
Although the adoption of the text of the Resolution was stopped by the use of the right of veto by the Russian Federation, we saw the Resolution as an important civilizational step forward in the fight for truth and justice.
We are convinced that this resolution is as important for the world as it is for Bosnia and Herzegovina, because it unequivocally expresses, on a global level, the condemnation of genocide and support for the victims.
The highest courts of the UN proved what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995.
There was no civil war in our country, as some wanted to portray it. It was an international armed conflict. Brutal aggression was committed against the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Joint criminal enterprises were conducted against our country, during which genocide was committed against Bosniaks.
These are facts that cannot be erased. These are permanent condemnations of the criminal large-state projects of breaking up Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Verdicts of the International Court of Justice and the Hague Tribunal do not exist to be archived. They must be thoroughly analysed and implemented.
Numerous final verdicts of international and national courts have proven that the only genocide in Europe after the Second World War was committed by the so-called army and police units of Republika Srpska.
During July 1995, over 8,000 Bosniaks were liquidated in a ruthless killing operation, with a clear intention, organized and according to a precisely determined plan and pattern, in a horrific manner. More than 800 children were among those killed.
In and around Srebrenica, thousands of captured Bosniaks were brutally liquidated and buried in mass graves. Hundreds of them were buried alive. Children were separated from their mothers and killed in front of their eyes. Mass and individual liquidations, forced relocation of residents, committed crimes of rape, violent separation of families, deliberate and targeted destruction of property and civilian objects, and imposed difficult existential living conditions, were consciously committed with the intention of physically or biologically destroying Bosniaks as an ethnic group.
About everything committed in and around Srebrenica, in July 1995, there is a lot of evidence, including mass graves - primary, secondary and tertiary.
The so-called political and military authorities of Republika Srpska planned the crime of genocide, its execution, the provision of logistical support, and then the concealment of the crime through the digging of mass graves and their concealment, which, I emphasize, was confirmed by the decisions of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
For the crime of genocide against Bosniaks in and around Srebrenica, the Hague Tribunal sentenced the first president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, Radovan Karadžić, to life imprisonment, as well as other top political and military officials of this parastate. They have been legally condemned, but their politics is not dead.
Unfortunately, the current president of Republika Srpska entity, Milorad Dodik, did not learn a lesson from the judgments of international courts. On the contrary, similar to the criminal Radovan Karadžić, Dodik denies the committed genocide, insults the victims and their families, and takes actions that represent a serious threat to the preservation of peace and security in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
For the investigation of the genocide committed against Bosniaks in and around Srebrenica, the verdict of the International Court of Justice is of particular importance, in terms of Serbia's responsibility for not preventing the genocide. According to the verdict, Serbia is the only country in Europe that violated the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
The genocide against Bosniaks in Srebrenica was not the result of spontaneity. In addition to the perpetrators of the genocide, we must shed light on the role of intellectuals, the media and other structures that designed, organized and supported the execution of the genocide.
The United Nations and the democratic countries of the world have acknowledged the mistakes committed towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, admitted the guilt of the international community, saying that ""Srebrenica represents the greatest shame in the history of the United Nations.""
Committed mistakes can no longer be corrected, but new ones can be stopped.
Therefore, the pro-Russian president of the entity Republika Srpska should be urgently and decisively stopped before he destabilizes Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans.
It is time for the European Union to join the sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States of America against genocide deniers and destroyers of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
The world and Europe must learn from Srebrenica.
Since the July days of 1995, the word Srebrenica has echoed around our planet as a symbol of the only genocide in Europe after the Second World War.
Any evil that we do not stop at the beginning becomes much bigger and more dangerous later on. Together, let us stop the new evil that threatens peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina again.
The brutal Russian aggression against Ukraine should be a reminder of what happens when the stage is to compromise and ignore dangerous policies.
The democratic and free part of humanity must clearly distinguish democrats from autocrats, victims from criminals. The direct or indirect equating of victims and criminals leads to a complete collapse of morality and our civilization.
In Europe, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, we must build a culture of remembrance of the genocide.
The genocide against Bosniaks in the heart of Europe must not be forgotten, marginalized and denied. We must not allow this for the sake of the future of humanity.
A culture of remembrance is not a culture of revenge. It is a culture of education about policies and ideologies that bring evil and violence.
The purpose of the culture of memory is not to create discord and hatred, but to prevent evil and crime.
With the culture of memory, we fight for democracy and human rights.
By remembering, we preserve the dignity of those who are not among us alive.
With memory, we fight for a safe future for new generations.
Thank you to the United Kingdom for preserving the truth about Srebrenica and giving hope for a more just future."
98244,"Address of the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the Academy in the National Theatre Mostar on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the unblocking of Mostar",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98244&langTag=en-US,2023-06-30,"Dear members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
respected families of fallen fighters and shaheeds,
respected veterans and war commanders, representatives of veteran associations, disabled war veterans,
representatives of all levels of legislative and executive power in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
dear guests, dear friends,
citizens of Mostar and Herzegovina,
Today is the third day of Eid al-Adha and allow me to once again congratulate all Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region and the world this great holiday with the words: Eid Mubarak!
The fight for Mostar was a fight for the survival of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why today, with pride, we celebrate one of the brightest dates in the history of Mostar and our country.
As a member of BiH Presidency, I have the great honour to address you today on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the unblocking of Mostar and the death of the famous hero of the liberation war, Brigadier General Midhad Hujdur Hujka.
Remembering the glorious past of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RBiH Army), recalling the commander Midhat Hujdur Hujka and his fighters, I want to clearly say that we are completely open to building the future on the foundations of truth and justice
Mostar was attacked by two evils from two sides. Nevertheless, even in such unfavourable circumstances, the RBiH Army managed to preserve the fundamental idea of freedom and equality.
In almost impossible conditions, when it had a double enemy against it, an embargo on the import of weapons and blocked borders, the RBiH Army managed, on this day, thirty years ago, to unblock a part of the city and connect Mostar with the rest of the free territory.
By unblocking Mostar, a message was sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe and the world, that the heroic RBiH Army will not deviate from the idea of a free and complete state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today I especially want to emphasize the role and importance of the Fourth Corps of the RBiH Army, which heroically led the fight for the freedom of Mostar and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The heroic struggle of the people of Mostar saved not only this city, but also the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in these areas.
The importance of the Fourth Corps for the defence of the country is immeasurable, and that is why I use this opportunity to express deep respect to the best sons of our country for everything they have done.
It will be permanently recorded that the weakly armed fighters of the RBiH Army heroically stopped the many times superior aggressors. They are most responsible for saving Mostar and the idea of a multi-ethnic and free Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The fighters of the RBiH Army wrote an unforgettable epic of the fight for the defence of their city, state and the civilisation values of modern Europe.
We must never stop speaking that truth.
The truth about the heroic struggle of the defenders of Mostar and Bosnia and Herzegovina was also recognized by Europe on May 9, 1995.
The RBiH Army is the only legal armed force from Bosnia and Herzegovina that received an invitation on May 9, 1995 to participate in the military parade in Paris on the occasion of Victory over Fascism Day.
In this way, Europe also recognized the honourable struggle led by the RBiH Liberation Army and included it in the European anti-fascist family. The honour of carrying the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina went to the celebrated commander of the 41st Mostar Glorious and Knight Brigade, Semir Drljević Lovac.
It was a recognition of the heroic struggle of the inhabitants of Mostar, who in impossible conditions defended the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the principles of common life in these areas.
The highest courts of the United Nations provided legal satisfaction to the defenders and citizens of Mostar and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Hague Tribunal confirmed the legal nature of the war waged against the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Final verdicts, including verdicts on JCEs, proved that it was an international armed conflict.
Neighbouring states fought a war for territories with the aim of creating a greater Serbia, and in one period of the war, a greater Croatia.
The crimes that were committed were not random, they were planned and organized with a clear goal in mind. The crimes were individualized, but it was proven that they were committed within the JCE, with the coordination of the highest officials of the neighbouring states and the entire system of civil and military authorities of para-state that were formed as part of the crime system.
The attempt to build the HVO (Croatian Defence Council) Museum on the site of the concentration camp and the scandalous messages of the war criminal Dario Kordić also speak of the failures of the international community.
Unfortunately, they failed to establish transitional justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That mistake must be corrected by the international community.
All legal mechanisms and diplomatic influence should be used to stop the construction of the HVO military museum on the site of the former Heliodrom camp.
Instead of building a museum, a suitable marker should be placed on this location, which will testify that there was a concentration camp in this place.
Unfortunately, the attacks on the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not stop even in the third decade of the 21st century.
After 1995, the big-state protagonists changed their methods and tactics, but the goal remained the same. This, among other things, is evidenced by the views of the Great Serbian ideologue Dobrica Ćosić, who openly explained how the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be destroyed: ""For two centuries we have had the same goal, which is the fight for the liberation and unification of the Serb people. (...) No war objective was achieved only in the trenches. (…) All war goals in the history of the world were achieved in peace (…) We have to conclude peace in order to end the war in peace and achieve our historical goals"".
Against the backdrop of these and similar instructions, the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity of RS, with the help of some external power centres, are trying to achieve in peace what the war criminals could not achieve with the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the genocide against the Bosniaks. We must oppose such criminal policy decisively and in an organized manner.
A dirty political, media, psychological, diplomatic and intelligence war is being waged intensively against our country and all those who sincerely defend it.
The manipulators are once again applying the tried and tested recipe of discrediting the cadres who unreservedly protect the state. The destruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina always started and took place through cadres. Cadres are the secret of politics.
As in the darkest times of aggression against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, theses are again replaced by targeted propaganda, the truth is twisted, lies are spread, labels are made, mocked, denigrated, accused, judged...
However, they must know that we will never give up. We must not be cowards and keep silent about new injustices towards the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens.
Experience tells us that only the state and state institutions can protect people and the state.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's political forces must be ready to use all available potential to help legal state bodies, with the aim of stopping political extremists. We must all show together that legalism is stronger than outlawry and legal violence.
We must not stop looking for the most effective way to protect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let tehre be no dilemma, it is about the political dimension of protection, because there are competent institutions of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina for international law, criminal law and security aspects, as well as institutions authorized by the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Before us is the fight for equal human rights of all people and the democratic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It's not time to calculate: Will we or will we not? Can we or can we not? We simply have to! We have to show people a good way in bad times.
Our vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one, unique, democratic and legal state, a member of the Euro-Atlantic family of countries, in which different identities - ethnic, religious, regional, social and other - are freely developed and respected, but also builds a common state identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the coming years, we must make additional efforts to speed up the legally defined path to the EU and NATO.
What in the war was the unblocking of Mostar, the defense of Sarajevo, Bihać, Goražde, Tuzla and other cities, today is the dynamism of Euro-Atlantic integration.
Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the world family of free and democratic countries and our place is among the most developed countries in the world.
Complete and unique Bosnia and Herzegovina has no alternative!
Freedom has no alternative.
We do not have country of our own but Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I firmly believe in the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
May there be mercy and glory to those who wove their lives into the foundations of the free and democratic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
May the indomitable state of Bosnia and Herzegovina live forever!"
98066,Address by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairwoman Željka Cvijanović at the Astana International Forum,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98066&langTag=en-US,2023-06-08,"First of all, I want to thank our hosts for their hospitality and the excellent organization of this important event. It is so nice to be here in the beautiful country of Kazakhstan. But it is also very nice and useful to have the opportunity to exchange opinions and views with other participants on some key issues of the modern world.
In the past several decades, especially after the Cold War, we have lived in the world of globalization where multilateralism is one of the prerogatives of international relations and actions, not only to achieve cooperation, but also to address various challenges and threats.
In this new pattern all the actors of international relations, be it states or other entities, are strongly oriented towards each other and are highly interdependent. And this is something that certainly never existed in earlier periods of human history.
It is quite logical that in such circumstances multilateralism has become a standard of communication and action in the modern world. And It is also logical that it has created “new rules of the game” that must be respected by all. But in reality this is not always the case which leads to the situation where multilateral structures become a tool or an instrument for realizing the interests and selfish goals of small number of countries who possess superior economic, political or military power.
And let’s be honest to say that some major crises in the world have occured due to the inability of multilateralism to solve accumulated regional or global problems.
The policy of power or force on one side and the policy of democratic multilateralism, on the other one, represent two opposite mutually irreconcilable poles.
We have learned so far that functional multilateralism cannot exist without a proper environment = that is a system of multipolar balance of power, where no actor or group of actors will be able to impose their own rules and attitudes on others and where the level of mutual respect and communication is much higher than is the case nowadays.
Therefore, in this globalized world, it is necessary to more sincerely return to a wider universal platform, while at the same time nourishing all regional forms of cooperation.
But evidently, the UN as the global platform has encountered numerous problems in fulfilling its own mission and basic function.Now it is more obvious than ever that there is no ""International community"" as a real collective category. The atmosphere within the global or international frame is too divisive for it to be seen as a uniform collective body.
But if we really want to consolidate the collective multilateral structures then it is necessary for certain actors to give up the policy of force. Obviously international relations are militarized and in order to overcome such a situation the concept of dialogue and diplomatic efforts needs to be revitalized .
This means indivuidual states must not use or misuse the regional or global structures to impose their own interests on the others.
I come from a country which is a perfect example of how multilateral structures have been misused by some countries in order to manipulate the implementation of an international treaty that established peace and constitutional order in BiH.
Following the war in BiH (1992 – 1995) and based on the above treaty the OHR was established to facilitate and coordinate some aspects of the post war processes. Contrary to the initial purpose and by acting beyond their mandate these foreign diplomats acting as HRs have turned into rulers who have usurped the competencies of our domestic institutions and have imposed numerous pieces of legislation, amended entities constitutions and even dismissed elected officials from office all by decree and without any due process. Their continued presence and the powers they illegaly excercise have created a situation where BiH is treated as a colony.
Therefore international structures and organizations must not serve as a playground of the “big ones”. If we speak about partnership then it should be partnership for all not partnership for one or several at the expense of all the others.
In the past decades we have seen many situations where one actor or a group of actors have tried to format the whole world in accordance with their own interests and goals. Great powers, as a rule, behave as superior and act from the position of dominance.
Thus, the key responsibility for the current state of affairs in the world, and for the fate of multilateralism, lies with those who act from the position of power. By doing so they may endanger and eventually completely ruin the major principles of multilateralism. On the other side, small or less powerful countries are far more ready for dialogue.
What we can see within the multilateral structures nowadays is far from shared values or common interests.
That is why the international structures and organizations must be redesigned in such a way that they ensure equality of all actors.
Sadly, double standards and hypocrisy are part of many multilateral processes of today.
The evident failure of the multilateral geopolitical concept does not necessarily mean that we should give up all the forms of multilateralism. It would be very dangerous even to think that international cooperation and multilateral approaches are no longer needed. On the contrary they are very much needed, but the current multilateral system should be rehauled and re-energized in order to address the complexities of a rapidly changing world.
Obviously a new rational and realistic agenda is needed to gather all the actors together within multilateral structures of the future otherwise multilateralism will end up in complete anarchy. And this is exactly what we need to avoid."
98004,"Address by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović to the public in the BiH Presidency building, on the occasion of the pronouncement of the verdict of the Internati",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=98004&langTag=en-US,2023-05-31,"Respected families of victims of genocide and war crimes, respected representatives of the media, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina! At the beginning of my address, I would like to remind once again that 31st of May is marked as the Day of White Ribbons, as a sign of memory and deep reverence for the 3,176 citizens of Prijedor who were killed during the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among those killed are 102 children. We must never forget the innocent victims.
Today is an important day for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region, Europe and the world. Thirty years of the history of the Hague Tribunal (the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - ICTY and its legal successor the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Courts -IRMCC) are behind us. Based on the judgments of this tribunal, we must continue our common journey towards justice and truth.
With today's final verdict against the leaders of the State Security Service (SDB), Jovica Stanišić and Franko Simatović, we are closer to establishing the full truth about the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The tribunal was established in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations (UN) due to crimes committed in the former SFRY, and especially in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, according to the assessment of the UN Security Council, represented a threat to international peace and security.
The President of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Courts (IRMCC), Judge Graciela Gatti Santana, emphasized, among other things, that the search for international criminal justice is a ""journey that never ends"". Recalling the importance of the establishment of the ICTY, the president of the IRMCC emphasized that the pronouncement of the appeal verdict in the case of the Prosecutor v. Stanišić and Simatović ""represents a firm sign of a step towards achieving justice"".
The establishment of the ICTY had legal, historical, civilizational and moral significance.
The tribunal was the first international criminal court formed after the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, which prosecuted criminals after World War II.
The Hague Tribunal left a huge archive of committed genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes. Among other things, the legacy of The Hague consists of: 2.5 million transcripts of court proceedings, 422,000 documents and 30,000 videos. 10,800 trial days were held at the Hague Tribunal, and over 4,600 witnesses testified. In total, almost 1,500 years of imprisonment and seven life sentences were imposed. The tribunal did not judge nations but determined individual responsibility.
After this verdict, politicians from neighboring countries, as well as some from Bosnia and Herzegovina, must understand that the policy of force, aggression and crime does not pay off and that there are always mechanisms that sanction such policies.
One of the goals of the ICTY was to bring to justice those responsible for the most brutal crimes committed after the Second World War.
The Hague Tribunal contributed to the establishment of historical facts, fight against the denial of the truth and helped the states created after the dissolution of the former SFRY to face their past.
The truth about the committed genocide and the legacy of the Hague Tribunal remains a permanent reminder to humanity.
The ICTY's legacy of civilization is that some of the highest officials responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes were brought to justice. Bringing the presidents, general, camp manager and other responsible persons before the Hague Tribunal exceeded the initial expectations from the beginning of the work of this international ad hoc court. With the decisions concerning the genocide committed against Bosniaks, crimes against humanity and other war crimes, the ICTY showed that the high position of an individual can no longer be a protection against criminal prosecution.
The tribunal also confirmed the legal nature of the war waged against the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The final verdicts of the Hague Tribunal, including the verdicts on joint criminal enterprises, proved that it was an international armed conflict. Neighbouring states fought a war for territories with the aim of creating a greater Serbia, and in one period of the war, a greater Croatia. These facts were established in eight final judgments of the ICTY.
Today's verdict against Stanišić and Simatović is important because the two former heads of the Serbian security service were sentenced with final force of law, thus confirming Milošević's commanding role, considering that this verdict refers to the Serbian State Security Service and its crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in Croatia.
The special importance of this verdict lies in the fact that the top leaders of the Serbian security service were legally convicted of crimes and involvement in aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Stanišić and Simatović acted under the direct orders of Milošević, who managed his secret police and its secret combat unit. Let us not forget, the secret units were also designed to hide the responsibility of the Serbian government for some of the worst crimes committed against civilians outside of Serbia.
The appeals panel found, among other things, ""that there was a joint criminal enterprise and that its common goal was the forcible and permanent removal of the majority of non-Serbs from large parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by committing murder, deportation, inhumane acts (forced relocation) and persecution, as charged in the indictment. (...) The appeals panel found that Mr. Stanišić and Mr. Simatović responsible as members of a joint criminal enterprise for crimes committed by various Serbian forces in 1992 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Bijeljina, Zvornik, Bosanski Šamac, Doboj and Sanski Most, and for crimes committed in 1995 in Trnovo and Sanski Most"" (...).
Transcripts from the Hague Tribunal trials, as well as documented digital evidence, provide much more detailed information about the role of Slobodan Milošević and Serbia than the verdict itself.
The huge archives of the Hague Tribunal await researchers. At the trial of Slobodan Milošević, Serbia's aggressor role was comprehensively discussed. Although it was widely assumed that, under the Milošević regime, Serbia supported Serbian parastatals in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the full extent of that support and the mechanisms by which it was provided were not revealed to the public until this trial. The death of Slobodan Milošević prevented a verdict against him, but it did not erase the facts.
Considering the aforementioned facts, as a member of BiH Presidency, I emphasize the following:
1. Judgments of the Hague Tribunal are of capital importance for the entire international law and order. The judgments of the highest courts of the UN established that genocide was committed against Bosniaks. At the same time, they are verdicts on the policies of the big states that tried to divide and destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent, sovereign, indivisible and internationally recognized state with a joint criminal enterprise.
2. The verdicts of the Hague Tribunal, including today's verdict in the case Prosecutor v. Stanišić and Simatović, established not only individual, but also institutional responsibility of high-ranking political, military and police leaders of Serbia for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war.
3. The international community and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina have a legal, political, moral and historical obligation towards the victims and future generations to demand:
- revision of history and other textbooks in the countries of the region with the aim of incorporating legally binding judgments of the highest United Nations’ courts;
- revision of the criminal legislation in the countries of the region in order to adequately prosecute and punish all those who glorify convicted war criminals;
- prosecuting and punishing those remaining responsible for the committed genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes;
- justice and truth for thousands of people who are still searching for the truth about the fate of their loved ones;
- implementation of mechanisms of transitional justice.
4. On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Hague Tribunal, I again request that the UN bring a just solution and that the complete original archives of the Hague Tribunal be stored in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Namely, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the beginning of this year I asked the UN Secretary General, the President of the UN General Assembly and the President of the Residual Mechanism for Criminal Courts to store the archives of the Hague Tribunal in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Millions of printed pages, audio recordings, videos, photographs, political agreements and secret data, which clearly depict what happened during the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, should be stored in Sarajevo.
5. The international community should not allow final court judgments to be archived and then forgotten. Bosnia and Herzegovina has the right to demand that:
- the international community, in the interest of all humanity, sends a message that the results of committed genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes cannot and must not be permanently recognized;
- representatives of the international community insist and encourage member states to fulfil their international obligations in good faith. It is necessary to take all necessary measures against countries that refuse to do so, provided for by the UN Charter and other relevant international acts.
- The UN, and especially the countries of the European Union, sanction all politicians who threaten and work to break up the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and glorify legally recognized war criminals as a precondition that such evils never happen again to anyone.
6. It is in the best interest of preserving peace, stability and good-neighbourly cooperation that the highest authorities and officials of the Republic of Serbia:
- responsibly face the consequences of the actions of their highest officials and institutions in the 1990s;
- stop denying the court-judged genocide against Bosniaks. No genocide after the Second World War has been so extensively and factually documented as the genocide against Bosniaks committed during the aggression against the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- provide access to key archives, remove the secrecy mark and ensure complete access to documents of the Supreme Defence Council of the FRY that have not yet been published;
- condemn the criminal project of Greater Serbia and permanently stop threatening the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- draw a long-term lesson from the fact that Serbia is the only country that has been judged to have violated the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;
- stop with the policy of undermining and disrespecting Bosnia and Herzegovina, and especially with denying the final and binding decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
- normatively and factually decide to establish good neighbourly relations between independent and sovereign states in accordance with the principles of international law;
- condemn and excommunicate perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes, and not glorify them;
7. Today's verdict is a new opportunity for Serbia to clearly distance itself from the architects, organizers and perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes, so that we can turn to building a prosperous future together.
The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and wider areas is not in hegemonic policies, conflicts and quarrels. The conviction of criminals and their policies is an important prerequisite for strengthening good neighbourly relations, stability and sustainable development. It is time to decisively start the process of raising awareness and conducting a reasonable and peaceful policy.
Finally, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, let us turn to the future, but with constant vigilance and caution, because genocide is repeatable. Let us not forget, the planners, order givers and perpetrators of genocide and only have respect for those who are trained for defence and who show a desire for defence. It us a lesson we all need to learn well.
Long live our proud and indomitable country Bosnia and Herzegovina!
- stop the practice of providing refuge to convicted war criminals."
97856,"Address by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dr Denis Bećirović at the 12th Sarajevo Business Forum",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=97856&langTag=en-US,2023-05-17,"Dear organisers, Excellencies, respected businessmen and entrepreneurs, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear guests!
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th Sarajevo Business Forum. Sarajevo is an open and cosmopolitan city, where well-intentioned people from all over the world always receive a warm welcome.
Sarajevo Business Forum has established itself as one of the most important business and investment events in this part of Europe. I am particularly glad that the importance of this forum grows year by year and confirms the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a strategically important destination that increasingly attracts investors from all over the world.
I believe that it is the duty of state officials to provide full support to gathering and connecting business people and investors from our country and the whole world, respecting our unique position at the crossroads of roads that connect East and West, both geographically and in terms of civilization.
Europe and the world have experienced tectonic changes in a short time, especially in the past two years. The world is at a geopolitical, security, economic, cultural and historical turning point. We must adapt to the new circumstances and do everything we can so that we do not become victims of global earthquakes again.
Paradigms which have existed for decades, once even for centuries, are changing or disappearing before our eyes. We no longer have to wait for decades for capital accumulation to push the limits of production possibilities. We must not continuously be a ""developing country"" without clear prospects and deadlines for overcoming such a position. Gone are the days of ""big"" and ""small"" economies and businesses. We are living the reality of rapid and innovative changes.
The certain European and Euro-Atlantic future of our country is an additional incentive for strengthening our economy. It is our obligation to rapidly harmonise our economic and administrative system with the standards of the European Union. Our ambition is to deepen regional cooperation as well. This helps us to be more competitive and attractive for companies from abroad that want to have their springboard in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region towards the EU market.
Politics and people in it must understand what our tasks and role in the economy of the new times are. We are in a merciless global game in which literally everyone is competing for the key resources, and through market share and influence, they strive to win or maintain relevance and their citizens' living standard. This does not mean that we are necessarily confronted with each other and that conflict is our destiny. If our competitors are global, then we have to look for partners all over the world, but not to forget those who are there with us. These insights must be at the core of the state's new approach to the economy, and we must define its role and tasks based on them.
I wish to be very clear here. On the one hand, the state must be actively involved in the economy by defining our interests and properly evaluating the existing structure of our economy, and then create the appropriate strategy and policies to realize them. On the other hand, the state must abandon the idea and practice of being omnipresent in the economy and get out of the positions that belong to private initiative.
It is time to bring the public sector closer to the standards and rules of the private sector in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We must relieve the private sector of excessively high levies and tax burdens on labour, as well as the burden of unfair competition. We will continue to open space for our companies abroad and protect their interests, but also show confidence in our companies and business people in the country.
Stable energy supply and energy security, as well as internal and external security in general, can only be ensured by states. It must be at the top of our priorities. We must have control over key energy resources and use them responsibly, always keeping in mind the need to protect energy sovereignty and future generations. We are part of Europe, and soon we will become part of Green Europe.
Let us support our businessmen, entrepreneurs and employers. They bear the burden of responsibility for shared success. We want to see even more domestic initiatives and investments. Employers should better organise, unite, define their priorities and promote them in dialogue with government representatives.
We must jointly invest more in the most valuable resources we have - the human resources. For too long, we have based our GDP growth on short-term consumption incentives, neglecting production capacity in the medium term and the development of growth factors in the long term, such as education and capacity for innovation.
It is important to continue and intensify investments in our economy, invest in the development of employees, increase their incomes and improve working conditions. Investing implies anticipating the future, but also an active work on its shaping and realisation. It involves the allocation of certain resources and their use in the most efficient way possible. It requires that we plan, monitor, redefine when necessary and constantly improve the entire process. We should not forget other important variables such as: the ideas and passion of investors, outcomes and opportunities that not everyone sees, and especially the willingness and commitment to turn good ideas into reality.
United around positive ideas and projects we have a chance, divided we don't. If others perceive us as divided, quarrelsome and weak, and our resources as prey, they will try to treat us that way.
We are hard-working people who badly need results, victories and self-confidence. The youth of this country should know that there are countries with comparable resources and a starting position as Bosnia and Herzegovina today; e.g. Singapore and South Korea in the mid-20th century, or Ireland at the end of the last century, managed to reach the very top of the developed countries of their regions and the world in less than a lifetime of a single generation. These are just some of the examples that nothing is permanently given and that positive changes are possible if we all work dedicatedly to make them happen.
Our specificity lies in the fact that our human resources are scattered all over the world. Of course, I am talking about Bosnia and Herzegovina's diaspora that emerged from the tragedy and civilizational injustice of the 1990s into a force that has great potential to transform our country. In politics, science, business, culture and sports, we individually have a number of successful individuals, families and companies around the world. The task of this generation is to bind those great soloists into a strong BiH orchestra and help them to transfer the acquired knowledge and understanding, and only then the material resources, to the country where they derive from.
To everyone who is considering investing in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, I wish to say that you are in the right place. This is a country that offers hard-working, educated, warm-hearted and good people, workers and experts. In addition to human resources, we also have natural resources that are largely unused. Wind, sun, hydro potential, ores, biomass, sea and Olympic mountains and forests are inputs that we want to develop on a sustainable basis and with responsible partners. Industries and sectors from primary to tertiary are developing and ready for investment momentum. In addition, let us not forget, our country has a stable monetary and financial sector.
Dear guests,
I want you to exchange business experiences and ideas, create new partnerships, conclude successful projects and build new visions.
I invite all those present, as well as our citizens in the country and diaspora, friends and partners around the world, to invest in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is an investment in the future.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country of the future."
97749,Address by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairwoman Željka Cvijanović at the session of the United Nations Security Council as part of the debate on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=97749&langTag=en-US,2023-05-10,"I thank you, Madam President, for this opportunity to address the Security Council.
I am encouraged to hear so many statements indicating that the governments represented in this meeting all share the same objective—a Bosnia and Herzegovina that is sovereign, independent, stable, functional, and prosperous.
With this shared goal in mind, I would like to emphasize three points that any informed observer must agree are key to accomplishing it.
First, and most important: the only realistic path toward this shared objective is adherence to the Dayton Accords, including the BiH Constitution, which incorporated a formula for power-sharing among the three major constituent peoples in BiH that share a long history of conflict.
The BiH Constitution was carefully designed based on a recognition of this simple reality and established a system with decentralized authority and important power-sharing mechanisms in order to give each of the groups confidence that it will not come under the rule of the other groups. This carefully crafted system has successfully preserved peace in BiH for more than 27 years.
Since the Republic of Srpska, the Entity that has elected me to the BiH Presidency, has been mentioned so many times here, I would like to note that at Dayton the RS agreed with the other parties to be part of a highly decentralized BiH in which all competences belong to the two Entities except for those few competences that the Constitution expressly assigns to BiH-level institutions.
In the decades since the Dayton Accords were signed, BiH has been contorted into a much more centralized system, due almost entirely to foreign interventions, rather than legal, democratic actions.
If we all share the common goal of a sovereign, independent, stable, functional, and prosperous BiH, then the most important thing that the Security Council and its members can do is to support the Dayton Accords by word and deed, and condemn actions that would undo the carefully crafted system of checks and balances guaranteed in the BiH Constitution.
My second point is that, despite some heated rhetoric, the security situation in BiH is, in fact, quite stable, as EUFOR has recently confirmed. BiH is not at all the powder keg it is alleged to be by some who seek more foreign intervention and control over BiH.
It is true that BiH often finds itself in a state of political tension, but that condition is typical among most democracies, including many of those represented here today.
And this brings me to my third point. The primary threat to BiH’s stability does not come from charged political statements, but from the failure to faithfully implement the Dayton Accords. Quite simply, if the deal struck at Dayton is not honored, then there is no hope for BiH’s success.
There are two particularly pernicious ways in which there has been a failure to adhere to Dayton. The first is the illegal transformation of the role of the High Representative from a facilitator into an autocrat with unlimited powers, vastly exceeding the strictly limited mandate agreed in Annex 10 of the Dayton Accords.
The despotic powers claimed by the High Representative are even more expansive than those of a foreign viceroy, as they are asserted to be completely immune from any limitations or oversight whatsoever.
Successive High Representatives, having almost no relevant experience in the region and few relevant credentials for the position, have ruled by decree with no local hearings, no consultation with elected bodies or officials in BiH, and no due process whatsoever—and they have done so with no authority granted by this Council or by any valid legal instrument or international organization.
These dictatorial actions have resulted in a flood of rash, ill-considered, humiliating decrees— more than 460 pieces of legislation and regulations, 110 amendments to Entity constitutions, and 249 extrajudicial punishments of individuals—all with no legal authority or oversight.
Despite widespread agreement—even among former High Representatives—that the High Representative’s claim to rule by decree is utterly illegal, Mr. Christian Schmidt has rashly announced additional disruptive decrees that have infuriated large segments of BiH’s population.
His latest edicts, which purport to amend the criminal codes of both of BiH’s Entities, yet again make a mockery of the rule of law, and represent just the latest brazen usurpation of the democratic rights of the citizens of BiH to rule themselves—rights that this Council is pledged to protect.
Furthermore, shortly before my travels to participate in this meeting, Mr. Schmidt, whose appointment this Council failed to approve, threatened that if I had the nerve to question his legitimacy before this Council, I would receive an answer I would not like. The attitude that Mr. Schmidt has shown toward the elected officials in BiH is, unfortunately, typical of the attitude of too many foreign officials who come and go in BiH.
Their arrogant, dismissive, and disdainful attitude toward legally elected and broadly supported domestic officials and institutions in BiH is, to say the least, unhelpful, and becomes particularly absurd when these officials sharply criticize the Entities for proposing laws mirroring those that have long been in place in these diplomats’ own home countries.
Remarkably, these officials, who work to usurp the constitutional authority of democratically elected officials in BiH on a daily basis, complain when local officials do not bend the knee and honor their illegal assertions of authority, and so we are accused of a “failure to communicate.”
The High Representative’s dictatorial rule is not just patently illegal, but it is also very counterproductive, as has been attested in recent years by former High Representatives.
The OHR’s looming presence and constant attempts to micromanage BiH suffocate the democratic process and hinder the unfettered internal dialogue and reconciliation essential to BiH’s future success.
Indeed, the OHR’s ill-advised interference more often creates rather than solves problems, as demonstrated by the way it has generated and enflamed the controversy regarding ownership of public property.
Initially it was widely accepted that the Constitution left public property to the Entities, an understanding used as the basis for various BiH laws still in force, and upheld by the Constitutional Court. Even statements made or supported by influential foreign officials in 2008 also demonstrated acknowledgement of Entity ownership of public property.
The issue was never in dispute until former High Representative Paddy Ashdown, with his typical imperial attitude, intervened to create the entire controversy. Years later, in 2012, when the parties in BiH agreed to a resolution of the public property issue, the deal was quashed by then-High Representative Valentin Inzko, simply because it was not driven by the OHR and crafted to his liking.
Uncertainty regarding public property, caused solely by OHR meddling, now hinders cooperation and progress in BiH, as the issue has been seized upon by those seeking to further centralize BiH in contravention of the Constitution.
If BiH is ever to be sovereign, independent, stable, functional, and prosperous, then BiH needs to be governed not by unelected foreigners issuing despotic decrees according to their own preferences and prejudices, but by its own Constitution, and its own citizens, in accordance with democratic principles and the rule of law.
The truth of this statement must, I think, be obvious to all members of the Council, but it is perhaps particularly clear to the many countries represented here that have proud histories of freeing themselves from despotic imperial rule by certain foreign powers.
And it must also be acknowledged by the members of this Council that the rule of law needs to be honored not just by local leaders in BiH, but also by those foreign officials that have long been ignoring or even actively subverting the BiH Constitution agreed at Dayton; that have been routinely and cavalierly violating the Vienna Convention’s prohibition against foreign diplomats meddling in local politics, and that have been influencing judicial cases that should be decided only in accordance with the Constitution and proper judicial integrity.
This points to a second important threat to the constitutional order in BiH. Unfortunately, some of the greatest distortions to the constitutional structure of BiH have been caused by the very institution established to uphold it—the BiH Constitutional Court.
The OHR frequently complains that the Court’s rulings are not being respected by the Entities. Тhis same OHR has hypocritically decreed that its own edicts are totally untouchable by the rulings of any court in BiH. Remarkably, the OHR never addresses the reasons why the Court’s decisions are met with skepticism, which is due to the corruption of the judicial process by the interference and influence of the OHR itself, along with that of certain foreign powers, as well as the effective control of the Court by its three foreign judges.
These foreign judges, who were meant to be a part of the Court only for the first five years of its operation, do not live in BiH, have no educational background in the laws of our country, do not speak the local languages, and issue contorted rulings that many agree read like political acts meant to please certain foreign powers rather than soundly reasoned legal determinations.
When a court ignores judicial propriety and the constitutional limits of its own authority, and issues decisions that are ultra vires, that court naturally squanders the respect of the citizens and the other branches of government. And when such decisions are the product of a voting bloc of foreign judges subject to outside influences, it is clear why such decisions lack credibility.
It is in the context of this total usurpation of the democratic process in BiH by outside powers, and the corruption of our judiciary, that so-called “secessionist rhetoric” and other political expressions of extreme frustration in BiH must be understood.
As for the RS, its official policy remains what it has always been: The RS is committed to BiH’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to the constitutional order established in the Dayton Accords, and it is committed to peace above all. But it is not ready to accept illegal, despotic rule by high representatives and unconstitutional decisions of the Constitutional court, nor to have its constitutional, democratic rights trampled and be treated as a colonial possession of certain foreign powers.
Somehow the RS has ended up in a sort of Orwellian position where complaints about the distortion and degradation of the Dayton Constitution are said to be anti-Dayton. The hypocrisy of such allegations, coming from some who actively subvert the Constitution agreed at Dayton, is astonishing.
If members of this Council will read the latest report from the OHR in this context, then they may understand that, to many of us in BiH, the report reads like that of a colonial viceroy to the home office, complaining that the locals, who are too ignorant and uncivilized to rule themselves in a constitutional democracy, do not respect and appreciate the benevolent despotism of the viceroy’s overlordship.
And if Council members will read the latest report from the RS, they will see that the RS cannot be accused of being some “renegade state” simply because it calls upon foreign officials to respect international law and the constitutional democratic rights of BiH citizens.
I again thank the members of the Council for their concern about the future of my country. I ask the Council to support BiH by advocating the full implementation of the Dayton Accords as written, and condemn foreign meddling in BiH that undermines the Accords, violates the rule of law, corrupts our judicial system, and hinders political cooperation within BiH.
As the most important concrete steps in this direction, this Council should make clear once and for all that the High Representative does not possess the despotic authority to rule BiH by decree and to confirm that our institutions at all levels of administration are entitled to make decisions in accordance with our Constitution.
I am convinced that BiH can have a successful future if the Dayton Accords are faithfully implemented with the support of this Council."

Address:
""Ladies and gentlemen, respected comrades, generals, professors,
Thank you for organizing this gathering, it was about time. If nothing else, let's look each other in the eye and, in popular terms, bear our souls. Let's not lie to ourselves, where we are and what we are at this moment.
At the moment, all kinds of things are happening in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina, it's not that it wasn't like that before, but it was in a milder form. Everything was leading to a climax and surely this whole situation will also reach that peak.
I, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, will respect this constitution that is currently in force, and as a lawyer I believe that constitutions and laws must be respected, there is no other way. Otherwise, any state and society cannot function. So, this constitution is the framework of our behavior and everything we think we should and everything we plan to do.
This kind of constitutional solution represents a kind of, as people have already said, straitjacket for all those who care about Bosnia and Herzegovina. One should ask what can be done in the given circumstances, and how. The key thing at this moment is to protect our institutions, because that ensures what we had in 1992, when the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina began, the international legitimacy.
We must not be the ones who'd be degrading or destroying those institutions, regardless of who is at the head of those institutions.
Do you think you can rely on the international community and foreigners? I argue that you cannot. I claim that they act according to the principle of might makes right, that is, whoever is stronger that is the factor being talked with. If you are weak, you are just a dish on the table, you are not a subject of conversation but an object. If you don't believe it, ask the Palestinians. Do not expect from the international community, I will not say miracles, I will say, do not expect anything.
The moment I saw it with my own eyes during the war, when the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina grew to the point that we were a serious military force, when we started conducting serious offensive combat activities, then we became a factor that is when they wanted to listen to us. When we showed that we were willing to make sacrifices to get what we wanted, then we became a factor whose opinion mattered.
When the Washington Agreement was created, what was happening in the military field? Remember Dayton and what was happening on the military field then. I'm not advocating any military action, I'm just saying how things are going. You have to be strong enough for anyone to respect you.
Why not tell people that we want Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state of equal people? Someone in Washington doesn't like it! I can only be equal if I am within the pack, I want to be human. What should I stand for, that we are an eternally divided society, that they sell me the story of the constituent peoples as a saving solution? Not true! That is what is now proving to be the basis for the disintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina! That kind of structure provides foundation for the talk of secession and self-determination. Bosnia and Herzegovina existed many, many years before Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia fell apart, Bosnia and Herzegovina survived.
For now, we have to rely entirely on the legal responses to the current situation. Now Dodik has started to raise tension, now he is speaking in front of the president of the neighbouring country, who is smiling at the announcements that he would annex part of the country. He should startle these foreigners, who are urging - don't fight. If he manages to work out some negotiations regarding state assets, he has already climbed a step higher.
What separates Dodik today from the secession of RS? What divides it? One session of the National Assembly of the RS government, one order to the Ministry of Interior of the RS entity, the media that he completely controls anyhow... What are we going to do?
The decision on the use of police units at the cantonal level can be made, but at the FBiH level would be difficult. According to the BiH Constitution, the decision on the use of the BiH Armed Forces cannot be made without the consent of all three members of the BiH Presidency.
What are we going to do, go to the entity line and shoot clay pigeons with shotguns? Don't be ridiculous. What is the answer? I refer again to the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here, let the Bosnia and Herzegovina's Prosecutor's Office say - he did nothing, that everything is politically legitimate, or arrest him. Just give the prosecutors freedom to practice law freely, and we'll know if we're wrong or if they're wrong. Again, we are being asked to practice false political correctness, not to waver, not to raise our heads, to be silent, to be hypocritical towards ourselves and to say - it's fine, at least there is no shooting. Ask the Palestinians if it's okay when there's no shooting! Why do these foreigners and part of the media see us as a problem?
There is a lot of anti-Islamism in such a relationship towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that is why this is the story of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary. His boss thinks the same, half of Europe thinks the same, at least 30 to 40% of Washington thinks the same. Let's be aware of that. Anyone who says otherwise is lying.
Do you want to know what the big plan is for the Balkans, for Bosnia and Herzegovina? What is Open Balkans, what is the story about changes to the Election Law in BiH? So Tirana, Belgrade, Zagreb. Division of the zone of influence between Albanians and Serbs, i.e. Belgrade and Belgrade. And that's what Rama and Vučić carry. This latter one calls it the 'Serbian world'. It's all the same. Where does that affect us? Through RS. What is the West's response to that? Pull in our ally NATO member and EU member Croatia and fulfill their wish. Give them that Election Law. Why? So that they manage the rest of the country. Why? So if Mile starts to secede, let Croatia defend the Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Why is Vučić arming Serbia? Today, Croatia is acquiring new weapons. Where are our new weapons? Do you think we can get it? When you start that story, they cut you like a sledgehammer. We want to arm ourselves too, but you can't! So it appears we present the danger with what we have, but those countries are not a danger given the fact they are arming themselves.
I am telling you this from the position of one who has been bitten once and is twice shy. I don't want any of this to remain unsaid so that we are in a situation tomorrow to be saying „what are they doing to us?!“ I just want us to be aware of the situation we are in. The answer to that situation at the moment is - we will not make the first wrong step. No, no, no! You will not provoke us to make the first wrong step. We have the wisdom and patience, but you won't make fools of us either. Protect the institutions, demand that the institutions do their job.
And tell them - that fascism that you are carrying out in Europe. Which, because of false political correctness you will not call by its real name, and the real name for fascism in Europe now is actually anti-Islamism, although anti-Semitism has not died either, but fascism in Europe has taken on a new form. Why not tell them that? What's the secret? What do I need, to wait for someone again to come to my front door and take me into the night because of the wrong name and surname? This almost happened to me in 1992 and never again. I will not put myself in that situation again; whoever wants to – be my guest.
This, dear friends, is what Bosnia and Herzegovina is all about. If we show them and tell them that they cannnot, while respecting all the standards that apply in the democratic world, because we are not the ones who will burn down our country. Showing them that we are both wise and smart and that we are aware that they and their policies will pass, but we are also determined to defend this country because we have no other, I have no other! For now, this is a political battle for Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is no retreat, the only way is forward!"""
97532,"BiH Presidency Member Dr Denis Bećirović's speech in Ahmići on the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the HVO's crimes against the Bosniak population of Ahmići, Donja Večeriska and othe",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=97532&langTag=en-US,2023-04-16,"Honoured families of the martyrs, dear citizens of Ahmići, esteemed reisu-l-ulema of the Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina Husein ef. Kavazovic, distinguished guests from abroad,
Today, we remember with sadness and deep respect the victims of the crime against humanity committed against civilians in Ahmići.
We have no right to forget 116 innocent Bosniak victims, killed in a bloody and criminal campaign by members of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Among the innocent victims were 32 women and 11 children under the age of 18. The youngest victim was a three-month-old baby.
The International Tribunal for War Crimes Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia ruled that the murders in Ahmići were a crime against humanity. One of the organizers and commanders of this crime, convicted war criminal Dario Kordić, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Unfortunately, not all perpetrators of this heinous crime in Ahmići have been convicted yet.
A crime against humanity has no statute of limitations. We will continue to bear witness to the broken human lives, broken childhoods and stolen hopes of the victims. It is our constant responsibility to convey and preserve the facts about the brutally murdered, but also to ensure a dignified life, truth and justice for the surviving residents of Ahmići.
Final judgments of the highest international courts cannot be obliterated or annulled. The world's highest courts have determined that Bosnia and Herzegovina was attacked and that genocide was committed against Bosniaks. Unfortunately, the threat of repeated crimes and genocide has not been eliminated. Politicians who openly threaten Bosnia and Herzegovina are still on the scene. We have no right to ignore and underestimate these threats.
British soldiers from UNPROFOR played an important role in uncovering the truth about Ahmići. One of the first people to arrive at the scene of the horrific crime was Colonel Bob Stewart. The contribution of this virtuous British officer was important in presenting to the international public the barbarity and brutality of this crime against humanity. Even today, Colonel Stuart is one of the sincere friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, he advocates a policy of support for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We send a clear message to Colonel Stuart and other friends around the world: We never forget our friends, we will teach new generations to respect the truth about great and humane people.
It is our permanent obligation to speak the truth and seek justice. Equally, it is our duty to fight for every criminal to be brought to justice. We have no right to give up on conveying and preserving the truth about the suffering of Bosniaks in Ahmići. We will never stop seeking punishment for those who have committed crimes. At the same time, we want to build a life together with all well-intentioned people who are fighting for peace and progress.
The defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be equated with those who attacked our country. We were not the same in the 1990s, and we are not the same today. Because we are not the same, we have the human, moral, and civilizational strength to condemn every crime. We are obliged to show respect to every innocent victim, we are obliged to demand the strictest punishment for every criminal.
Evil must not be forgotten nor underestimated.
On 20th of November, 1945, in Nuremberg, the famous American Prosecutor Robert H. Jackson gave one of the most important courtroom speeches in history. On that occasion, he said, inter alia, : ""The crimes that we are trying to condemn and punish were so evil and with such a devastating effect that human civilization could not tolerate them, leave them unnoticed, otherwise it would not be able to survive such a repetition"".
Even today, in Ahmići, well-intentioned people are obliged to say, like prosecutor Jackson, that we must not forget the evil acts committed in Ahmići because the path from oblivion to repeating the crime is not long.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we must build a culture of remembrance. It is not a culture of revenge. It is a culture of educating about policies that bring about evil and violence. The purpose of the culture of remembrance is not to create discord and hatred, but to prevent evil and misfortune.
We must affirm the culture of remembrance as a strategy of fighting against forgetfulness. We do not retract with the culture of remembrance. Memory helps us find meaning in the present and answers for the future. That is why the culture of remembrance must never be erased, with its existence we remember all the innocent victims and protect new generations from repeating evil.
The culture of remembrance helps us fight for a democratic society in which there will be no denial, revisionism and negationist rhetoric. Let's not forget, with memory we preserve the dignity of those who are no longer among the living.
Well-meaning people ask the legitimate question: When will we achieve justice and true peace?
Without a statesman like Willy Brandt, there is no real peace in this region. We need leaders who have the strength like Brant who had knelt in the Warsaw Ghetto, to knee down in every place where any innocent person was killed.
Brant's ""falling to his knees"" should someday be an inspiration for responsible politicians in the former Yugoslavia, for whom, unfortunately, moral lapses are a frequent occurrence, and humane and responsible actions are rare.
We must understand the times in which we live. This is the time of tectonic geopolitical earthquakes, which also greatly affect our country.
Only by being aware and gathered around strategic topics for the future of our homeland, aware of the historical, cultural, moral, spiritual and other values of our country, can we build a society of freedom and equality for all citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Regardless of all the suffering, I believe in the safe future of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have a future if we teach our children to be smarter and stronger, to love their own and respect others. We must create a democratic and civilized society in which people will be judged on the basis of the human virtues. Building such a society is an obligation and moral-historical debt of both us in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the representatives of the international community."

""The times in Bosnia and Herzegovina are the way they are. This day falls at a politically turbulent time. And when we start thinking it can get better, things start going other way round. This day is dedicated to people who have a connection with the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and who today serve in the Second Ranger Regiment.
Everything that the Army, I will say it with immense pride, the magnificent Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina did in the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly not only the merit of the fighters. We should not forget the units of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all those people who were doing their job, like the medical staff, like the people who worked in the military industry, the people who made sure we had something to eat during the aggression. They can also be seen in that image of the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina bore the brunt of that fight to the greatest extent possible. When one looks at that time, and how it all came about, from this distance, one wonders if it was possible? That in such a ratio of forces without any structure, except for one part in the Territorial Defence, that such an Army was created and became a political factor. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was a magnificent accomplishment of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Second Ranger Regiment that inherits the tradition of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has every reason to be proud of everything it inherits. The function of that regiment within the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a guarantee of peace and any stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In terms of their numbers, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are small, in terms of their equipment, they are not up to par with neighbouring countries, but as long as they exist, they are a guarantee of peace. If the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were to disintegrate, the question is what would happen in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That's why they should be preserved, and lessons from 92-95 should be learned. One of the most important experiences that can be gained from the existence of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is that you can only rely on yourself. Rely only on yourself. Stay alert, follow what's happening. The history of this country teaches us that almost every generation gets stuck in some conflict, whether it is world conflicts or conflicts that do not have the character of world conflicts. What the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina did, believe it or not, still serves as a basis when we talk about the defence of the country. I wish for you to just read about this experience, learn it, and wish for you to never have to use it.
I know there are those who are disappointed in everything they see today. Back at the end of 1995 and at the beginning of 1996, we had imagined our country to be different to what it is like today. We have reason to be proud of all that we have done. We did our best to defend this country. This is what a living man can be proud of, and the generations after will be able to say that their ancestors managed to defend this small, yet large, suffering, yet rich country that did not deserve all that history, neighbours and the big world players serve it .
Happy anniversary to all of us of the founding of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Day of the 2nd Infantry Ranger Regiment of the Armed Forces of BiH."

I congratulate you on the 31st anniversary of the formation of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army and the Day of the 2nd Infantry-Ranger Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
As a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I express my deep gratitude to those who sacrificed their lives and their health for the defence of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and especially to disabled war veterans, families of martyrs and fallen soldiers, golden lilies and all fighters for their selfless contribution to the defence and building of our state of Bosnia. and Herzegovina.
Thirty-one years ago, the legal Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed the Decree on the formation of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army. It is one of the most important decisions in the long history of our country. It turned out that the Freedom Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the most important historical fact in the centuries-long history of our country.
In the time of the most difficult challenges and temptations, the Army defended the country and freedom. We proudly preserve the tradition of the Freedom Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which defended the multi-ethnic, democratic and indivisible state of Bosnia and Herzegovina of equal citizens and peoples.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is most deserving of the fact that they defended the results of the legal and internationally recognized referendum for the independent, sovereign and indivisible state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also, it is most responsible for the fact that our country's admission to the United Nations did not remain a dead letter.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was essentially different from those who attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina. It led a defence-liberation struggle and did not wage war on the territories of other countries, nor for the interests of other countries. With respect for the highest moral and military rules, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina first achieved a moral and civilizational victory, and then military victories.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina defended universal human values - freedom, equality, equity and independence of the internationally recognized state of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was subjected to brutal aggression. It protected the vulnerable and the powerless, prevented even greater genocide, guarded and defended kindergardens, hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, synagogues, museums, libraries... People who love Bosnia and Herzegovina can be proud of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The entire democratic world recognized the heroic and righteous struggle of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On the 9th of May 1995, for the first time in its history, Bosnia and Herzegovina received an invitation to participate in the military parade in Paris on the occasion of the Victory over Fascism Day. The only armed force from our country that received an invitation to participate in the parade was the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is an indelible and permanent recognition of an honorable struggle. It was a global expression of respect for the heroic struggle of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which defended the statehood and freedom of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in almost impossible conditions. The aforementioned international support is still important in the process of Euro-Atlantic and European integration of our country.
Today, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the only legal military force in our country. They are, among other things, in charge and ready to provide military defence to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as assistance to civil authorities and the population throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina represent the guarantor of security for every human being. The state authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina have clearly defined that our strategic goals are full membership in NATO and the EU.
I would like to thank NATO and our allies for their help and support in strengthening the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the entire security and defence system.
Members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina also participate in peace support missions. Thanks to the constant progress on this front, today Bosnia and Herzegovina is no longer only a recipient, but also a provider of international military aid. And the units of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are especially responsible for that.
In the previous months, as a member of the Presidency of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I visited Brussels twice and spoke with the highest NATO and EU officials. Among others, I spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer and Quinta ambassadors in NATO. Also, in Brussels I spoke with the highest officials of the European Union. It is encouraging that at these meetings the willingness to help Bosnia and Herzegovina on its accelerated path to Euro-Atlantic and European integration was expressed.
At all these meetings, I clearly indicated that NATO and the EU are the strategic goals of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Strategic goals can only be changed in the state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As long as state laws and strategies are in force, all state authorities are obliged to respect them.
Full NATO membership is a guarantee of security for all people. It is the best possible legacy we can leave to our children and future generations. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only NATO aspiring country that has activated its Action Plan for NATO membership. In addition, our country received candidate status for EU membership.
No destructive rhetoric, no media and political hoaxes, no decisions of any lower level of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina can stop the path of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards NATO and the EU.
Unfortunately, we are once more witnessing anti-Dayton threats to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our answer is clear: we will respect the Dayton Peace Agreement, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the final and binding decisions of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We benevolently recommend destructive politicians who attack the legal order of the country to come to their senses.
Those who may start to unilaterally destroy the constitutional order of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be ready to take full responsibility for this kind of destruction.
The message to the separatist politicians is the following: We will never bend the knee. Never! We will fight for the human rights of every person in our country. We will strengthen state institutions. We will strengthen our Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will protect our country Bosnia and Herzegovina and we will continue our European and Euro-Atlantic path.
Our commitment is peace and security for all people. We will build peace and always be ready to defend the country, identity, honour and dignity. We must be alert and careful.
Let loyalty and devotion to Bosnia and Herzegovina be stronger than personal vanity and party animosities.
The preservation and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina is our debt to those who laid down their lives in defence of our only homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Finally, once again I congratulate one of the greatest dates in our history - the Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
May the invincible state of Bosnia and Herzegovina live forever!"
97167,Address by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairwoman Željka Cvijanović at the UN Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=97167&langTag=en-US,2023-03-22,"Your excellencies, Distinguished colleagues and guests, It is a privilege to be here today and discuss the topic that is fundamentally important for the whole world, and, one can easily say, for the future of humanity.
I would first like to thank the organizers for the invitation and the opportunity to speak on this occasion.
This is especially because the topic in question, considering its immense importance, can never be given the amount of attention it actually deserves.
The limits of natural resources and their accelerated consumption represent one of the biggest challenges today.
In a world inhabited by more than eight billion people as of the end of last year, the question of resources, their efficient use and equal distribution, emerges as a priority and requires quick responses and sustainable solutions from states, international organizations and other subjects.
The need to find a sustainable solution is all the greater when it comes to a vital, essential and irreplaceable resource such as water—a resource on which human life depends.
To illustrate this, if the entire supply of the world's water were placed in a four liter jug, the drinking water available to us would fit in one spoon.
This additionally points to the obligation of responsible and rational use of water, even in those parts of the world that do not have issues with water shortages.
Water has always been a multidimensional resource, and its utility value has greatly exceeded the role of satisfying basic human needs.
The importance of water for preserving our environment, regulating climate conditions, as well as for sustainable economic development, especially in areas such as agriculture, industry and energy, is immeasurable.
The modernization of the Water Services Sector is a strategic priority of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the environmental sector and an essential step towards the country’s EU integration.
Fundamentally, it is helping the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. In addition, modernization needs of the water sector in BIH require extremely heavy investment. That is also the case with poorer countries, which will need substantive international funding support from the richer countries.
In an effort to ensure the long-term sustainability of supporting activities, in particular infrastructure investments in the sector, major international development partners in the country established the Water Alliance BiH in 2020.
These international development partners are committed to use the Water Alliance BIH as a consultation and coordination platform with a goal to support both entities of BIH in the Modernization of the Water Services Sector.
Through this collective approach, the Water Alliance BIH continues to engage with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and support their commitment to implement the necessary reforms and systemic changes in the Water Services Sector in further alignment with the EU water related legislation.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular, hydropower represents a huge development opportunity, and one of the strategic and still underutilized branches of the economy.
In accordance with this, our development plans for the future are largely based on investments in the energy sector, the importance of which in the global framework is greater today than ever before.
Unfortunately, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, short-sighted political interests sometimes take precedence over elementary economic logic.
That is why many important hydropower projects, that we in Republic of Srpska intend to carry out together with Serbia, are subject to pointless obstructions and blockades by certain political actors.
However, this will not impede our determination to use the hydro potentials which are our great development opportunity and a competitive advantage to the maximum extent, for the common good.
Certainly, the use of hydro potential for development purposes also implies a high level of awareness of the necessity for preserving the environment.
On the path of development, we are obliged to strive to preserve natural resources, because if we endanger our planet, damage the climate and the ecosystems, pollute our seas, rivers and lakes, we will endanger our own existence.
The scarcity of water, its pollution and floods in many parts of the world contribute to the fact that water-related risks have been at the top of the list of the biggest global challenges for years.
About one fourth of the world's population still does not have access to safely managed drinking water services, while almost four billion people, or virtually half of our population, do not have safely managed sanitation services.
The data from UNICEF, according to which in 2015 around three hundred thousand children under the age of five died from poor sanitary conditions, poor hygiene and inadequate drinking water. This is devastating and terrible!
We cannot ignore such horrible tragedies that happen throughout the world every day.
This is not a challenge that individual countries can overcome independently.
It is thus necessary to make additional joint efforts so that in the coming years all people have access to drinking water, as well as appropriate sanitary conditions.
It is very important that today, on World Water Day, we also have the opportunity to discuss these challenges, because I am aware that numerous human lives, and in the long term, the fate of our planet, rest on overcoming them.
If there is a goal that should unite us, regardless of all other global challenges, differences and rivalries, it is the provision of a sufficient amount of water, as well as adequate sanitary conditions for all people in the world.
Thank you for your attention and for all you do on this issue!"
96798,The speech given by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairwoman Željka Cvijanović at the Summit of the Non-aligned Movement Contact Group in Azerbaijan on the subject “The Non-aligned Movement in th,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96798&langTag=en-US,2023-03-02,"Honorable representatives and distinguished colleagues, I am honored to have the opportunity to address you at this important gathering. First, I would like to express my gratitude for the invitation to the President of Azerbaijan and the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, Mr. Aliyev.
It is a true privilege to be here today and discuss many important issues, not only at a symbolic level, but concretely, through the idea of partnership and solidarity.
This gathering is happening at a time, just like in the period when the Movement was formed, when the world desperately needs peace, relaxation, dialogue, and restraint from the intent to make an existing problem bigger.
The global challenges we currently face point to the importance of respecting the timeless and universal values and principles based on which the Non-Aligned Movement was founded and rests today.
The world we live in is changing at a dramatic pace and, unfortunately, not in a positive direction.
The corona virus pandemic has left serious and long-term consequences throughout the world.
They primarily include lost human lives, and besides in medicine and health care, they are visible in almost every other segment of society, too.
Due to the pandemic, economic challenges have become even more complex and multiplied, both globally and in individual countries, especially in the poor ones.
At the height of the pandemic, the differences between developed and underdeveloped countries were especially pronounced, in terms of access and distribution of medical supplies, such as respirators and medical protection equipment, or the vaccines in the later phase.
The principles of solidarity and mutual assistance retreated before the fear of an invisible enemy that spread at a tremendous speed, defying all the restrictive measures introduced by the authorities throughout the world to preserve their populations.
However, there were also positive examples, such as the actions of those countries and international organizations that offered their assistance to the most vulnerable.
As a representative of an observer country, I want to praise the role of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was then, and still is, at the center of multilateral efforts aimed at overcoming the negative effects of the corona virus.
Unfortunately, the period of gradual recovery, which followed the stabilization of the epidemiological situation in the world, was marked by new global security challenges, armed conflicts, and the dramatic sharpening of geopolitical rivalries.
So it sometimes seems that the post-covid recovery, like many other important topics in the previous year, has gone to the background, at least as far as the media and their focus are concerned.
Yet, the lack of media interest does not mean that these challenges have disappeared or diminished.
That is why I consider it very important that within this summit we have the opportunity to draw the attention of the international public to the problem of post-covid recovery, as well as to the importance of making additional efforts to overcoming negative effects of the pandemic.
That task is not easy at all, considering the complex circumstances and the huge mess the world is in at this moment.
War, sanctions and terrorist attacks demonstrate that the language of force and weapons has prevailed over diplomacy and dialogue, and sometimes, it seems, over reason itself.
And while people get killed, a huge part of the world has turned into cheerleader camps that are putting out a fire with gasoline.
In the spiral of violence and war hysteria, those who appeal for peace and dialogue, refusing to align themselves with one of the opposing camps, are viewed with suspicion, almost with hostility.
As you know, three decades ago a bloody civil war raged in the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Especially tragic was the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which almost 100,000 people died.
Unfortunately, we know very well what war is and what sanctions are and what consequences they bring, because we still feel them today, 28 years after the end of the armed conflict.
That is why we sincerely sympathize with and mourn every lost life in Ukraine and in other parts of the world because we know that they are not numerical data but human beings whose lost lives caused deep wounds to their forever forlorn families.
The tragedy we went through compels us to talk about it from a human and humanitarian point of view, with the full awareness that the price of war is enormous, just like the importance of peace.
And especially at this very place, because the principles on which the Non-Aligned Movement was founded are the only possible path to peace and long term stabilization of the current geopolitical and security challenges.
The world urgently needs a reaffirmation of the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries and peoples, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
Within the collective three-partite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I strongly advocate these values, as well as the consistent respect for the domestic and international rule of law.
International law was not established to be a dead letter or a buffet from which everyone, on a case-by-case basis, takes what suits them.
It was defined as universal, with the clear intent that it should be respected equally by all entities, regardless of size, population, and their military or economic power.
The consequences of the collapse of the global order based on international law are instability and anarchy, in which no one wins in the long term, and everyone loses, to a greater or lesser extent.
I am convinced that, among us here, there is a high degree of agreement regarding the fundamental values on which the international order should stand, among which peace, stability and cooperation are among the most important.
I am pleased that, as a representative of an observer country, I am attending, for the first time, the gathering of the countries of the Movement that has shown the ability to survive and maintain its importance in spite all global changes.
The fact is that the circumstances - in which it arose in 1961 in Belgrade, the capital of the SFRY, and today the capital of Serbia - are different, but not entirely incomparable to the current ones.
It is also the fact that many non-aligned countries, then poor, have managed to change from undeveloped into developed, modern countries.
This is exactly why the countries of the Movement represent an excellent framework for a new economic cooperation, and thus it is important to rehabilitate economic and business contacts between them.
Both then and today, the Non-Aligned Movement strives to preserve the international balance, affirm cooperation and mutual respect in the bilateral relations of its members, but also in the global order.
That is why I am convinced that our tradition of non-alignment, founded on the legacy of SFRY foreign policy, can be a strong bridge of cooperation and understanding in the future, both through strengthening of bilateral relations with the member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, and through participating in multilateral initiatives of general, global importance.
We have many common challenges, whether it is the post-covid recovery or the current insecurity and geopolitical turbulence.
Therefore, I believe that we can also jointly reach certain conclusions that could contribute to overcoming these challenges.
Thank you."
96785,The address by Dr. Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96785&langTag=en-US,2023-03-01,"Esteemed excellencies, eminences, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, at the beginning of my address, I would like to express my special gratitude to the anti-fascists of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the last two wars, who are most responsible for the fact that we have a state today and that we can celebrate the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The first of March is among the five most significant dates in the millennial history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The first such date is the year 949, when the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus published his famous work ""De administrando imperio"" (On the Administration of the Empire), in which the existence of the ""land of Bosnia"" is mentioned for the first time in a written historical source.
The second date is 29th of August, 1189, the day when the famous ruler of Bosnia, Ban Kulin, issued a charter guaranteeing Dubrovnik merchants freedom of movement and trade in Bosnia. It is the oldest preserved Bosnian state diplomatic document found, written in the Old Bosnian language and in the Bosnian script, “bosančica”. From a legal point of view, it can be stated that Kulin's charter is the ""birth certificate"" of Bosnian statehood and irrefutable proof that Bosnia had an organized state and the institution of a sovereign ruler in the 12th century.
The third date is the 25th of November, 1943, when Bosnian statehood was restored at the First Session of ZAVNOBiH.
The fourth date is the 1st of March, 1992, when, in a legal and democratic referendum, over 64% of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for an independent, sovereign and unified Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The fifth date is the 22nd of May, 1992, when the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted to full membership of the United Nations.
These five dates in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be written in capital and golden letters, for children to learn in schools, for important cultural and public institutions and other important objects to be named after them, and for every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be proud of, regardless of ethnic, religious, political or ideological affiliation.
Unfortunately, the big-state protagonists are trying to deprive our state of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its right to exist.
They are trying to steal and reshape our history and literature. They do not respect our national sovereignty. They deny our ethnic and linguistic identity, and abuse our right to religious identity. They are stealing Bosnia and Herzegovina's talents in sports, science and many other fields.
Despite all that, they fail to break the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has not been permanently subdued by much stronger forces in the last thousand years. Bosnia and Herzegovina has always had its sons and daughters, who protected it. That's how it was and that's how it will stay.
Because of irresponsible individuals who interpret the principle of self-determination without arguments, we must clearly answer the question: what is the ""right to self-determination of the people"" and how is it realized?
Even Slobodan Milošević did not know the answer to it when in 1991 he appointed the so-called Badinter's commission. His question then read: ""Does the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as one of the constituent nations of Yugoslavia, have the right to self-determination?"" The arbitration commission gave its answer in the form of an ""opinion"". It was difficult for the followers of big-state politics to learn that all international instruments related to the principle of equality and self-determination of peoples should be understood first of all in a territorial sense and not in a strictly ethnic sense.
Unfortunately, once again on the political scene we have followers of Slobodan Milošević's big-state politics.
They still do not accept the fact that the principle of self-determination is in permanent conflict with the principle of political independence of existing states in the world. Namely, if all ""nations"" resorted to this right, the territorial integrity and borders of many states would be called into question.
The General Assembly of the United Nations has precisely determined that the right to self-determination must never be understood as approving or encouraging activities that would threaten, in whole or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of states. That is why, among other things, the secession of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entity of RS is impossible. because the population of one part of the independent, sovereign and indivisible state of Bosnia and Herzegovina will never be able to decide the fate of the entire population of our state.
Never! Let separatist-oriented politicians remember that well.
The Dayton Peace Agreement confirmed the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and state continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a candidate for membership in the European Union and a country about to join NATO.
Before our country are important and demanding stages of the process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. Bosnia and Herzegovina should be helped to build functional state institutions, capable of taking responsibility for the accelerated movement of our country towards membership in the EU and NATO.
Unfortunately, the continuous and systematic attempts to weaken and destroy the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina have not stopped.
During the period of aggression, it was carried out by mass killings, expulsions, crimes against humanity and genocide. Today, that goal is being implemented through a systematic blockade of the state, attempts to weaken and collapse state institutions.
The ultimate goal of the destructive forces is the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state. The direction of those projects will not change in the coming years either. There are no serious arguments or assumptions that this can change in a short period of time.
It is no secret that in our country there are destructive politicians who openly advocate the destruction of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the peace process.
I deliberately connect the preservation of the state and the peace process because only the malicious and naive can even think that it is possible to destroy the legal order of our country and not threaten stability and peace in the entire region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an isolated island. We are inextricably linked to the democratic and free world.
Today, when we celebrate our national holiday, we should also remember our friends who are going through difficult times.
Today, as we celebrate our national holiday, we should also remember our friends who are going through difficult times.
Once again, I express my deepest condolences and solidarity with the brotherly people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by devastating earthquakes. I also express my condolences and solidarity to the people of Syria. I am especially proud of our rescue teams who saved twenty-six lives. They are the pride and mirror of the brave and charitable Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am also proud of all Bosnians and Herzegovinans who once again showed that they have big charitable hearts.
Tonight I also express solidarity with the brave President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. We are on the side of Ukraine and the free world. We are not neutral and indifferent to the sufferings of the people of Ukraine because neutrality is another name for supporting Putin's regime.
Ladies and gentlemen,
at the end of the address, I would like to emphasize that there is no issue that is politically, morally and existentially more important than the issue of preserving the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let's suppress party and local politics in favour of state politics.
Let loyalty and attachment to Bosnia and Herzegovina be stronger than personal vanity and animosity.
Let's determine a red line below which one cannot go at the state level.
We are not silent in the face of injustice.
Let's not agree to division and discrimination.
Let's not respond to provocations with hatred and destruction.
Let us respond with love and by building kindergartens, schools, colleges, factories, libraries and apartments for young married couples.
It is the best answer to the politics of destruction and division.
Bosnians and Herzegovinans, in the country and abroad,
Happy Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
96780,The speech by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the reception marking the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96780&langTag=en-US,2023-03-01,"At the beginning of tonight's address, I would like to greet our brave Bosnians and Herzegovinians who are here with us tonight.
These are the people who, with their charitableness, self-sacrifice and kind heart, extended a hand of salvation to the unfortunate population of the Republic of Turkey, who suffered in the catastrophic earthquakes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is proud of you. All of us together showed solidarity with the affected population of the Republic of Turkey, but those of you who went to the scene did the hardest job.
Thank you! Thank you for selflessly contributing to Bosnian-Herzegovinian society with your daily activities in solving difficult and unforeseen situations.
Dear Excellencies,
ladies and gentlemen, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina...
Exactly thirty-one years ago, with the declaration of citizens in a referendum, Bosnia and Herzegovina began its struggle for independence and sovereignty, which is still ongoing.
Opponents of the independence and existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not achieve their goals even with armed aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, an internationally recognized state. Bosnia and Herzegovina has survived in its recognized international borders, despite everything, and even despite the so-called the international community.
The armed aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina did stop with the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, but the political one is still ongoing. From this follows the logical conclusion that the struggle for independence and sovereignty is still ongoing.
The outlines of that struggle in the last years, and even in the last months, are particularly visible. Unfortunately, our country is now faced not only with the big-state aspirations of its neighbours and their, I would say, traditional attempts to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also with inappropriate foreign interventionism that may have seemed confusing, strange, almost unbelievable to us at first. So confusing, strange and unbelievable that even many did not want to believe their eyes. Then the logical questions appeared, all of a sudden, although it is not really all of a sudden, because let’s remember the experience of the war, where did the human rights, equality, democratic standards, democracy in general disappear? Where did the international support for the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina disappear, to now allow those false friends to be taking a measured cut with our neighbours.
The nature of that interventionism and the solutions that are trying to be imposed are contrary to all democratic standards, but also contrary to the March 1 determination of Bosnians and Herzegovinans on the equality of all citizens and peoples living in this country. The manner in which these solutions are being imposed, despite the will of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is brazen and rude.
Basically, they deny the assumption of any independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the most part view such treatment of Bosnia and Herzegovina with displeasure. Such political activity will no doubt one day find itself on the wall of shame and judged by history. Unfortunately, sometimes things in Bosnia and Herzegovina look like a slightly dressed up, made-up replay of the cruel and bloody reality and events that we have already gone through in the war!
Let's just remember the arms embargo against the defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the cowardly instigation of the division of the country through the so-called peace plans and negotiations. Today, they offer us an embargo on democracy and respect for basic human rights, supposedly conciliatory agreements and plans that ultimately lead to the complete dismantling of Bosnian-Herzegovinian society with a certain division of the country as the end result. However, this is not at all a reason for any kind of pessimism, let alone defeatism.
The struggle for independence and sovereignty in the period from 1992 to 1995 was a general struggle of people who have no other homelands, people who only defend their own, and do not reach out for other people's homeland. That struggle was brought forward by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, members of all its ethnic, religious or other identities, and not by our false friends.
Even today's sincere advocacy for the independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina is above all a matter of conviction and awareness of Bosnians and Herzegovinians, who have no dilemma as to what and whose Bosnia and Herzegovina is.
Only those who identify with Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in the armed struggle, that is, the defence of the independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and those who do not identify with Bosnia and Herzegovina attacked it.
Of course, even today we cannot rely on those who do not identify with Bosnia and Herzegovina, but neither can we rely on those who put the sign of equality between these two categories, justifying such a position with alleged political correctness, as they like to call it. This sign of equality is also put by some foreign officials who tell us that for the survival and vitality of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is of crucial importance that they manage the places of decision-making, and that we should believe that they care more about Bosnia and Herzegovina than ourselves.
This is exactly the kind of order that has been established in Bosnia and Herzegovina today. Such an order is directed against the independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is such that it cannot be called by other words than the ones that I will not utter for the sake of the solemnity of this moment.
However, as I have already said, this is certainly not the reason for any kind of defeatism and pessimism, but quite the opposite, the reason for struggle. It is good that certain illusions have finally been lifted. It is good that we finally know who is in favour of real independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and who thinks that our legislation should be decided by foreigners and the governments of neighbouring countries. It's good that we finally determined the place where we meet, but also the place where we diverge.
Therefore, freed from those illusions, we should not and cannot be sad nor depressed, but rather joyful. Glad that the fog has cleared and we can see clearly who is who. Joyful because we finally know who, in the current and future struggles for independence and sovereignty, we can count on and who we can't count on, and finally joyful because we know that it is not the mass of undecideds who waver that wins, but those who are determined and who know what they want.
We will continue to fight for independence both legally as we do, and politically, but also in every other way because we no longer have a choice. Once we step in, there is no going back.
No one who has won freedom gives it up voluntarily. Sometimes it seems to us that they would leave us alone if we gave up our independence. They wouldn't, they would just persecute us even worse. Those who think today that they will leave them alone, if they submit to them, are seriously mistaken, they will be persecuted even more.
Those who know whose Bosnia and Herzegovina is will win, and it is ours and only ours. Those who are determined, not those who find themselves in the sea of false dilemmas. Those who fully identify with Bosnia and Herzegovina will win, because they know what kind of Bosnia and Herzegovina they want. Free and democratic, country of equal people, country of order and human rights!"
96710,"Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić gave a pertinent speech tonight at the central ceremony on the occasion of celebrating the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96710&langTag=en-US,2023-02-26,"Dear Bosnians and Herzegovinans! Thirty-one years ago, due to the dissolution of the former common state, a referendum on the independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was organized in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The referendum was preceded by numerous political events both internationally and domestically. And while the separatists were already trying to create a political and legal basis for separatism through illegal and legally void plebiscites, the forces loyal to the Republic, on the international level, were trying to gain support for the organization of the referendum. They succeeded in that, so the referendum was called based on the findings of the Badinter Commission.
At the referendum on independence, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina overwhelmingly chose the path of independence, exercising their democratic right. Immediately after the announcement of the results, Chetnik separatists organized through paramilitary formations began obstructing normal and everyday life in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and soon they were joined by the Yugoslav People's Army and the formed para-institutions that were created by the division of the security agencies of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Many times, better armed separatist forces together with the Yugoslav National Army, realizing that they cannot prevent the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was already officially recognized by the leading countries of the world at the beginning of April, embark on an armed aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This aggression began with mass crimes in Eastern Bosnia, the attempt to seize the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May 1992, and a series of massacres of the civilian population in cities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted to the United Nations on 22nd of May. That act put an end to the issue of international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina gained international recognition as a member of the United Nations, but at the same time Bosnia and Herzegovina was punished by the same United Nations by introduction of an embargo on the import of weapons, which made it difficult, almost impossible, for the defenders of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend the Republic, and the perpetrators of genocide and those who committed ethnic cleansing with the help of neighbouring Serbia, and a year later Croatia, were given an additional wind at the back.
This put the aggressors against Bosnia and Herzegovina in such a better position militarily, that it is simply unbelievable from a military point of view that they did not manage to completely destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state, considering the advantage they had in weapons, but also the support they received by a significant part of the international community, which viewed the extermination of an entire nation and the destruction of an internationally recognized state quite favourably. All the hypocrisy of politics, as well as false sympathy for the weak, came to the fore in that first year of aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Instead of, as is the case with Ukraine today, the defenders of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were provided with weapons in order to be able to defend themselves against aggression, we were forced not only to deal with the consequences of the introduction of the embargo, but we were also forced to negotiate numerous ostensibly peace plans that were nothing more than proposals to divide the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the prospect of its complete shutdown.
We should never forget that the most shells fell on the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the very day when the so-called Owen - Stoltenberg's plan to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into three republics was negotiated in Geneva. All this was by no means accidental. They wanted to force us to capitulate in that way as well. We were about to be faced with a choice, either we will sign what is completely acceptable to the aggressor, or we will pay with our lives for rejecting that dishonourable offer. It is understandable that it was not easy for those who made those decisions. It was also not easy for us who, with a rifle in our hand, asked for the fight to continue, but we persevered. We did not capitulate.
Of course, we should not forget, especially when we see what is happening today on the political level, the following. It must not be forgotten that Lord Owen, in that most difficult time in 1993 when he was trying to gain support for his plan to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the one who took Fikret Abdić with him during the negotiations and showed him as a cooperative and good boy who is ready to agree to many concessions that the legal representatives of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not agree to.
Unfortunately, even today, some new ""Lord Ovens"" are looking for new Fikret Abdić. Their political methodology is the same. Their targets are the same, and even those behind them are the same. Where did they come from and why do they still exist? They exist because the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina has never stopped. The forces that attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina did not come to terms with its independence and sovereignty. They will still continue to attack. We can defend ourselves only if we defend ourselves with the courage with which we defended ourselves in the period from 1992 to 1995.
In this fight, we can and must rely on ourselves first. If we hope for the help of others, and if we are passive, we ourselves will question the survival of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am convinced that we will not be passive, and that we will not idly wait for the situation to unfold. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country of those who identify with it. Anyone who does not identify with Bosnia and Herzegovina is not someone who can be relied on. We don't need to beg anyone for love for our country anymore, because we have enough of that. And this gathering here shows us that love for the homeland is not lacking at all. The enemies of Bosnia and Herzegovina must know and will know that we will never lack the courage to defend Bosnia and Herzegovina from all attempts to threaten it. That is why we recommend to them the peace which we sincerely desire and which we now enjoy.
However, peace can only be preserved by those who are ready to fight for what they consider their greatest value at any moment. Bosnia and Herzegovina is our greatest value and measure of things.
Cheers, and a warm welcome to you all. Happy Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
96252,The speech given by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairwoman Željka Cvijanović at the Christmas reception,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96252&langTag=en-US,2023-01-12,"Dear attendees, Ladies and gentlemen, Brothers and sisters, I am immensely happy that we are gathered tonight on the occasion of the most joyous Christian holiday - Christmas.
The light of the birth of Jesus Christ has illuminated our homes and the hearts of all Orthodox believers, both here and in the world.
That's why I want us to share the joy and light of Christmas together this year and also, from this place, to send messages of peace, love and goodwill.
Peace and love are the fundamental messages of Christmas, but also universal and timeless values on which social communities and human civilization as a whole rest.
Their absence is the cause of many misunderstandings, conflicts and wars, some of which, unfortunately, we are still witnessing today.
The impressive technological development of humanity in recent decades, unfortunately, has not been accompanied by an equivalent moral maturity.
Lasting peace remained an ideal and an unattainable dream that was denied in practice by harsh reality.
Just like in families, the lack of dialogue and conversation between peoples and countries around the world leads to misunderstandings and rising of tensions.
Conversely, where there is honest and open dialogue, regardless of mutual disagreements, peace will never be questioned.
It is a clear signpost for everyone, but especially for us in this region, who well remember the tragic period when words fell silent and weapons spoke.
That is why there is no greater duty, individual and collective, secular and religious, than preserving peace in international and interpersonal relations.
It is necessary for us in Bosnia and Herzegovina also to talk and conduct a dialogue about all the open issues that weigh on our everyday life.
To respect each other, respect the diversity of identities and interests, looking for common ones on the basis of which we will build a better and more successful future.
The common obligation of all of us is to provide the generations to come with a safe and stimulating environment for development and prosperity.
And that they are never faced with the existential challenges faced by ours, as well as many previous generations in these areas.
We live in a country of diversity, but we still cannot say that we are, as the slogan of the European Union promotes, ""United in Diversity"".
In order to achieve that goal, we need peace and stability, as well as more orderly relations at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is necessary that, instead of international interventionism, national institutions at all levels of government take full responsibility for the processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are not against the constitutional BiH, as foreseen by the Dayton Peace Agreement.
We are legalists and we believe that without full respect for the Constitution, the highest legal and political act, the rule of law remains just a dead letter on paper.
This is why we think that BiH can be possible to the extent that everyone respects the letter of the Constitution, and then also each other.
We do not wish to live in a country of blockades and obstructions, but in a country where every nation and every entity will be able to express its full capacity and its ability to progress, because no one has the right to block economic development, energy stability and new jobs.
Especially in today's world where every megawatt of electricity, barrel of oil and cubic meter of gas is vital.
""Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favours!"" (Luke 2:14)
Nothing so simple, divine and human illustrates the essence of Christmas as the words of this angelic song.
With immense gratitude that you graced tonight's reception with your presence on the occasion of the most joyous Christian holiday, I greet you all with a traditional Christmas greeting:
Peace of God! Christ is born!
Thank you!"
96230,The speech by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the event “The January 9 - the path to Genocide”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96230&langTag=en-US,2023-01-09,"Dear citizens, professors, scientists, It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to be the keynote speaker at the scientific meeting "" January 9 - the road to genocide"".
The January 9 1992 cannot be viewed outside of two contexts, legal and political, which are unified in the idea of the genocidal intent of the Greater Serb policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The road to genocide is precisely the unity of attempts to undermine the constitutional and legal order of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and attempts to completely exterminate Bosniaks, Croats and others who do not belong to the Serb people from the most of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of course, here I will leave it to historians to clarify the historical context of what preceded that January 9, 1992. I will use the opportunity to briefly refer to the political goal of what was proclaimed through the declaration on the proclamation of the so-called Republic of the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although that declaration on the proclamation was, even at that moment, a legally void document, which failed to prevent the legal authorities of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from calling a referendum on independence, it has political significance, precisely from the aspect of the political goal that was not realized, even with the use of genocidal violence.
Namely, on January 9, 1992 in Sarajevo, the so-called Assembly of the Serb People proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which according to that proclamation is part of the Federal State of Yugoslavia, as its federal unit.
We all know that the declaration of this illegal and unconstitutional assembly did not receive any international support, and that the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a referendum.
The only way for part of Bosnia and Herzegovina to remain part of the Federal State of Yugoslavia, as its federal unit, was for the advocates of that policy, faced with legal defeat, to use genocidal violence.
That process, which had as its goal the destruction of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its entire peoples, began on January 9, but did not result in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina belonging to another state, i.e. Serbia.
When the authorities of the RS entity today mark the anniversary of January 9, they simultaneously cover up the fact that the Great Serbian regime of Milosevic and Karadzic, even with the help of genocide, did not succeed in making part of Bosnia and Herzegovina part of Serbia. The RS is an entity in the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not a federal unit within Serbia. That part of Bosnia and Herzegovina will never become part of Serbia, because the actors of that policy in the period from 1992 to 1995, when they had absolute military superiority, especially when it comes to resources, I would say, missed the opportunity to seize part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were stopped in this, with the great sacrifices and heroism of the members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the MUP (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of the RBiH, as well as the people who stood by them.
Nevertheless, we are witnesses that the continuation of the genocidal policy, cherishing what is the spirit of January 9, and its spirit is nothing but crime, are parading again today and trying to send a message that they have not given up on seizing a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The way they do it and the place where they do it do not allow me to agree with the assessments of certain levels of government and responsible persons who claim that such events do not threaten the security situation.
A satisfactory security situation is not an expression of the cessation of hostilities, but of the overall political and social environment, which is far from satisfactory, and therefore I use this opportunity to call for caution when it comes to assessing the security situation.
The goal of the January 9 parade by the authorities of the smaller BiH. entities is evoking memories of committing genocide, which they are proud of, intimidating the people, but also raising their own prices, first of all with foreigners, who are always in such and similar situations, ready to run to us who are for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of who at that moment is in the government, and always with the same question, with the question of what we can give to Dodik and the separatists in order to preserve stability and peace.
However, in this regard, I think it is finally time for us all to say together that we cannot and will not give anything to Dodik and the separatists, because they have too much anyway.
Dodik does not have the Yugoslav People's Army and its arsenal behind him, he does not have the numerous paramilitary formations that his ideological and political predecessor Radovan Karadžić had, and it is not wise for him to provoke a conflict in which the loss of what was gained through genocide is possible.
I am convinced that the authorities of the RS entity are also aware of these facts, just as it is clear that Dodik must not gamble. That what he is allowed to do is to provoke in the hope that we will forever seek protection from the non-existent international community, which will then do everything to calm down the separatists in RS.
That is why I stand by the fact that in the future we should not ask for any help from foreigners in curbing Dodik's separatism, because so far it has proved to be a complete failure, and we have usually received their rhetorical condemnations, in the form of demands that on some other issues from of state importance be lenient.
We are already a bit tired of empty declarative condemnations, and hypocritical announcements in which all parties are called to lower tensions, while it is clear that not all parties raise tensions, and we do not place any hope in empty rhetoric that equates those who attack the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all others.
However, what we are sure of is that we will defend this country at all costs in the event of a secession attempt. The goals from the declaration of January 9, according to which part of Bosnia and Herzegovina should have been annexed to Serbia, will never be realized. We will never give up on Bosnia and Herzegovina. We didn't give up even when the arms embargo was introduced, and we are not giving up even today when the democracy embargo is being introduced."
96223,"Speech by BiH Presidency Member Dr. Denis Bećirović at the Panel of Experts ""January 9",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=96223&langTag=en-US,2023-01-09,"Ladies and gentlemen, Respected families of victims of genocide, Dear guests, Esteemed colleague Komšić,
At a time when separatist political circles are sending out various and numerous untruths, falsifications and hoaxes, it is very important to use science and scientific facts to oppose genocide deniers. I believe that Panel of Experts, such as this one today, are very important because they provide a scientific valorization of undeniable facts and contribute to a comprehensive overview of our past from historical, legal, sociological, psychological, demographic and other aspects.
In 1992, the highest legal act of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not prescribe any right to self-determination for ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why the anti-constitutional gathering of part of the renegade members of the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 9, 1992 was an act of lawlessness and violence against the legal order. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in its decision of September 15, 1992, evaluated the proclamation of the so-called of Republic of Serb Bosnia and Herzegovina as an anti-constitutional act. The same position was adopted by the Badinter Commission of the European Union in 1992.
The criminal policy of separating the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and creating a parastate on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, designed and led from Belgrade, was in contradiction with the domestic legal system and international law. That is why the so-called Republic of Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina/Republika Srpska was a dead creation and the international community never accepted it as an independent international subject.
Today's marking of January 9 in the BiH entity RS represents a violation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the Constitution of BiH, the final and binding decisions of the legal Constitutional Court of BiH.
At the 96th plenary session of October 11 and 12, 2013, the Venice Commission adopted an opinion on the compliance of the elections of the BiH entity RS with the anti-discriminatory standards of the Council of Europe, ie the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The commission concluded that the celebration of January 9 as the day of BiH entity of RS, is a discriminatory act against other peoples in that part of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that it is not in accordance with the basic democratic values and postulates. Such a policy is not in line with values such as dialogue, tolerance, mutual understanding and equality, which should be the basis for choosing the entity day, the Venice Commission assessed.
In its final and binding decisions, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled that the celebration of RS Day is unconstitutional and contrary to Article II/4 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the norms of a constitutional nature: Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Article 1. Protocol No. 12 to the Convention, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
It is high time that the officials of the BiH entities of RS and Serbia stop their anti-Dayton activities, as well as their immoral and anti-civilizational policy of denying the judicially and scientifically proven genocide against Bosniaks. It is time for them to start respecting the judgments of international and domestic courts.
Let's not forget, the planners and performers of the criminal policy of destroying the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina were sentenced to more than a thousand years in prison at the Hague Tribunal and courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and abroad. Therefore, the glorification of the dark politics that committed the only genocide in Europe after the Second World War represents an unacceptable act of insult and provocation for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Union and the United Nations.
The genocide against Bosniaks is not a historical accident. It is the result of planned and organized actions of Greater Serbia ideology, politics, media, army, police and other factors. The crime of genocide against Bosniak population could not have been carried out without genocidal intent, system and planning engagement of numerous institutions.
We have to be careful. Genocide is repeatable. Ideology, politics, media and other factors that led to the genocide of Bosniaks are still active and dangerous. The threat of a new genocide has not been eliminated. The planners and perpetrators of genocide have only respect for those who are trained to defend themselves and who show a desire to defend themselves. It is a lesson we must learn well.
In the interest of peace and a secure future, court rulings must not be archived and forgotten. The international community, in the interest of all humanity, should and must send a global message that the results of genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes cannot and must not be recognized permanently. It is high time for the international community to stop destructive policies that glorify legally convicted war criminals.
The Hague Tribunal is not a political court but a legal court of the United Nations. Only political advocates of criminal politics can be against the courts of the United Nations. If it were not for the Hague Tribunal, no one in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region would be held accountable for the genocide and the most terrible crimes committed in Europe after the Second World War.
Permanent and indelible international court rulings cannot be hidden or denied. Important lessons for the future must be drawn from these judgments. Denial and futile running away from the truth will not help anyone. That's why everyone should face the truth and turn a new page in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.
Today we express our solidarity with Ukraine's just fight against brutal Russian aggression. We belong to a free and democratic part of the world. The award given by the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina of RS entity to Russian President Vladimir Putin represents an unprecedented civilizational shame. It is not a mirror of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is another stone in the mosaic of the destructive entity politics of RS.
In the end, if we should say two key words from this panel of experts today, they are: truth and future. Those two words are inextricably linked because without truth there is no better future. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region is not in hegemonic policies, conflicts and quarrels. It is time to decisively and thoroughly cross paths with criminal policies and start the process of raising awareness and conducting a reasonable and peaceful policy.
Let's tell the new generations to never emulate convicted war criminals. Young people should emulate the great and world-renowned Bosnian humanists, scientists, cultural workers, writers, painters, athletes... Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country of the future. In the state of the future, there is no place for the glorification of convicted war criminals.
Thank you for your attention!
Long live the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
95784,The speech by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the official reception in Vienna organised to mark the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95784&langTag=en-US,2022-12-05,"Honorable Excellencies, Minister Podžić, Ambassador Kozarić, Ambassador Bencun, Brigadier Bajramović! Respected representatives of the military, ladies and gentlemen! It was a particular pleasure for me to respond to the invitation to celebrate the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina here in Vienna to send clear and strong messages together.
Seventeen years ago, with the adoption of the Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the process of establishing a professional Armed Forces of our homeland, trained for various types of operations and activities, began.
Those regulations carried with them a powerful message at the time, namely that anyone can be a part of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnic, religious or any other affiliation. The only essential condition was to be able to handle the challenges that are an integral part of doing this job.
I have already said this once, but I will say it again, the 1st of December - the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina - is the day to remember the contribution of those who, investing a lot of knowledge, effort and sacrifice, created the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina of today.
Although it was a very complex process, which required determination and patience, today we can safely say that the process of establishing the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the best examples of a successful reform in our society and country.
Despite the difficulties, which are mainly reflected in the lack of financial resources, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are unconditionally available to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, assisting civil authorities in responding to natural and other disasters that, unfortunately, have befallen us in recent years. They are a significant guarantor of state stability and protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I have had the opportunity to see the courage of our soldiers many times. Those young men and women had an adequate and courageous response to the challenges they faced. One of those occasions was a meeting with members of our Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the NATO mission ""Resolute Support"" for 2020 in Afghanistan, where they showed readiness and an exceptional level of ability to react in emergency situations, rivalling the largest military forces in the world. Our soldiers, for their participation in peacekeeping missions around the world, continuously receive the praises in which their professionalism and dedication are highlighted, which we should all be proud of because they represent us and our country Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The foreign policy strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is very clear. In that document, it was pointed out that in the continuation of activities on reform processes in our country, NATO remains the priority of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am not saying that it will be easy to bring this process to an end, there is a lot of work ahead of us, but all our diplomatic activities will lead to full membership in the NATO alliance, which is of great importance for the security, stability and overall progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For the overall development of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the strengthening of personal capacities through the training of soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers, as well as education of military personnel abroad, is of particular importance. That is why I use this opportunity to welcome the successful cooperation between the Federal Ministry of Defence of Austria and the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is reflected in the project of training our cadets at the Theresian Military Academy here in Austria.
I congratulate the cadets who graduated this year and became lieutenants, and now work as platoon commanders in our units. To the cadets of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are currently attending training and are here with us tonight, I wish good health, happiness and success during their education and work.
Without a strong Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country itself cannot count on the protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty. The stable and strong Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the main guarantee of the survival and stability of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a lever that must never be called into question. At a time when, unfortunately, wars are again being waged in Europe and the world, and when certain countries, in violation of international law, are once again carrying out aggression, the importance of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is absolutely crucial for our homeland.
Let's acknowledge everything we have done to date, and what we will do in the future so that the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain a strong and unassailable pillar of our society. I am sure that the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the democratic principles of openness and cooperation, regardless of the challenges they will face, will do everything to make Bosnia and Herzegovina an equal member of the Euro-Atlantic family in the future. I can promise you that I will do whatever I can.
Once again, on behalf of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in my own name, I congratulate all the members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Armed Forces Day and the 17th anniversary of its establishment.
Thank you for your attention."
95712,Speech by the member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić at the Ceremonial Academy on the occasion of the 17th anniversary and Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95712&langTag=en-US,2022-12-01,"Honourable Excellencies, generals, officers and non-commissioned officers, soldiers, dear guests. It is my honour and pleasure to be able to address you on the 17th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in my own name.
December 1 - Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the day to remember the contribution of many who invested a lot of knowledge, will and effort in the process of establishing the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although it was a very complex process, which required determination and patience, today, 17 years after its establishment, we can safely say that the process of establishing the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the best examples of successful reform in our society and country.
The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina today, in 2022, represent a factor of stability and security in the entire state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are a reliable partner, first of all to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state institutions, but they also prove to be a reliable partner to our allies at the international level
The credibility and importance of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina grows stronger every year, and the leadership and members of the Armed Forces represent the Armed Forces with dignity both domestically and internationally. This year alone, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina successfully participated in six international military exercises. In doing so, they continued the tradition of successful cooperation with allies, which was reflected in previous years through successful participation in peacekeeping missions.
No less important is the cooperation of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina when it comes to carrying out tasks to help the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina and civil authorities in responding to natural disasters and similar challenges, whereby the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a rule, show a high degree of responsibility and readiness to act on the orders of its Supreme Command.
And during this year, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina proved to be one of the most vital state institutions that successfully perform their tasks. Of exceptional importance for the overall process of NATO integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fact that the Light Infantry Battalion Battle Group of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a few months ago, successfully completed a NEL 2 evaluation during exercises held ON the Manjača training range.
This not only continued good cooperation with our NATO allies, but also confirmed that our units are able to achieve excellent results according to NATO standards. We can be proud to have a reinforced battalion level unit ready and available in the NATO basin of force for future NATO operations, European Union and United Nations peace support operations, as well as for participation in NATO exercises.
It is important to know that this was preceded by the participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the NATO Summit in Madrid, where Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only country that participated as a pretender, a country that is in the process of Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
A few months before that, at an extraordinary NATO summit, on March 25 this year, NATO made a decision to strengthen forces on the eastern front and provide additional equipment to NATO members. It is of great importance that Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the only member of the MAP, is included in this additional equipment. All these activities, as well as the continuation of cooperation between the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom, are encouraging from the aspect of strengthening the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina through the exchange of experiences and close cooperation with allies.
Ultimately, the submission of the Reform Program for 2022 by the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with the previously mentioned military-diplomatic activities, testifies to the acceleration of Bosnia and Herzegovina's path towards full membership in the NATO alliance. In this sense, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina definitely represent the main engine of NATO integration.
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that in the current year we finally managed to increase the salary of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. True, that this increase is insufficient, but finally, after a long time, the ice was broken, and the trend of stagnation and reduction of income for members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was stopped. I hope that the trend of increasing the salary of members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue. Therefore, I call on the future holders of executive and legislative power at BiH level to include exactly this at the top of their priorities.
I am aware that bringing about a new and more significant increase entails difficulties given the unhealthy political environment in which we live, as well as the fact that it may be accompanied by some demands that have nothing to do with improving the status of members of the Armed Forces, but the responsible government must not pay attention to small details politicking if the end result will be the improvement of the financial status of the members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of particular importance for the overall development of the Armed Forces of BiH is certainly the strengthening of personal capacities through the training of soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers, and the education of military personnel abroad. It is possible to be done in a better scope only by including the issue of better and more significant financing of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the top of the state priorities.
Without a strong Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country itself cannot count on the protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty. The stable and strong Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the main guarantee of the survival and stability of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a lever that must never be called into question by anything. At a time when, unfortunately, wars are again being waged in Europe, and when certain countries are once again committing aggression in violation of international law, the importance of the Armed Forces is absolutely first-rate.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina can find support in our Armed Forces as well as a tool to deter any form of possible violence against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, all of us together, for the sake of our future, must and will be committed to strengthening the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in my own name, I congratulate all members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I wish you all happiness and success in your future work and life.
Thank you."
95586,"Speech by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, City Hall Vijećnica, 24.11.2022.",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95586&langTag=en-US,2022-11-24,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, dear guests
This year marks the 79th anniversary of the formation of the First Republic in the history of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After two years of joint struggle against fascism and occupation, through the National Liberation Movement, the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina formed a people's government in 1943 and proclaimed a Republic based on the values of anti-fascism.
Thus, the foundations of the modern statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina were set, without which today's Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have been possible, nor would any future be possible without those fundamental values on which the country itself was built.
On the day when we celebrate the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is our duty, therefore, to remember with much respect all those great men who imbraided their lives and their life's deeds into the struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina and its statehood. We are also obliged to know that in that time of darkness and fascism, the Bosnia and Herzegovina’s man rose far above many others who had neither the strength nor the courage to do such an act, all the while putting himself on the right side of history.
It is thanks to all of them, both great and ordinary folk of our Bosnian-Herzegovinian peoples, that we still have our state today.
Continuing the tradition of one of the best generations of Bosnian people, we carry on the fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina, both nationally and abroad, the country in which there is a place for all its citizens.
ZAVNOBiH confirmed and established the borders of the Republic, defined its territorial integrity and formed the government as a republic. All of these are elements of state sovereignty, which decades later are being attacked and threatened, and for which we are fighting today.
However, unfortunately, it seems that we often forget some of the basic lessons of ZAVNOBIH. It is, therefore, worth reminding of them on this day.
We must know that it is precisely ZAVNOBIH that teaches us that it is not possible to receive a state as a gift, just like that, by referring to a historical right, centuries-old continuity, etc. One must fight for the country and fight continuously!
It cannot be obtained with the help of strong allies, and even when you share civilizational values with them, and without the struggle of an internal factor, as was the struggle of the People's Liberation Movement.
If the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from 1941 to 1945 waited for the final stages of the Second World War, and had they not only formed a government but also defined the goals of their political struggle in Mrkonjić Grad in 1943, no support of any allies would have helped in the formation of the Republic. And dare I say, there wouldn't be one.
The most progressive elements of the society at that time succeeded in politically and militarily overpowering those forces that wanted to tie the fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the outcome of political undertakings of other states, as well as ideologies.
They did not allow anyone else, besides themselves, to form a government for them, nor to form the principles of such a government's operation, nor the key state priorities.
That is why the brave enterprise of the generation 1943 is monumental, and from a historical point of view, their efforts can be compared to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian people who, in the period from 1992 to 1995, managed to preserve the state its legal continuity.
Today, it seems that we have two versions on stage, or rather two visions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, very similar to those of 1943.
That proud, defiant and brave Bosnia and Herzegovina is not afraid to say that it cannot be made into an ethnically divided country, that citizens cannot be forced into ethnic ghettos with some self-proclaimed leaders of those ethnic communities.
We are not afraid to say that we strive for a state system in which every citizen has equal rights and where every vote in elections is equally valid. We are not afraid to say that we are advocating for a system of values as is present in all the countries of the European Union. This is the centuries-old, proud, defiant, brave and never conquered Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, we also have another version of our country, one that is anti-ZAVNOBIH, a subservient state that is afraid to fight for all the values of the modern democratic world and for the values on which this country was founded.
That subservient mindset of some is built on personal interests and a system that generates corruption and nepotism on the widest scale, from which their fear of the international community also springs. It is a system that protects itself, through its submissive expression and servile attitude towards all those who do not want any progress in this country, but the maintenance of the existing status quo situation, which cannot, and will not, lead us to membership in the European Union nor the NATO Alliance.
Such people, in moments when we are fighting for fundamental human rights in our country, tell us that we should not actually fight for the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a state and society of equal people. They tell us that such a society and state will be built by others.
Such people tell us and lead us to build partnership with different parts of the international community on a basis of servient mentality and to unconditionally accept everything that comes from that international community, regardless of us being aware of what terrible, even disastrous solutions we are getting into. That's how slaves, if you'll excuse the expression, behave, not free citizens.
That's why I invite you today, on this festive day, so that we can all be part of the proud, defiant and brave ZAVNOBIH’s Bosnia and Herzegovina, which knows what it wants and how to realize its ideas of the state of equal citizens, with equal rights and equal freedoms.
I invite you to show what we have been showing for centuries: that we are a proud nation of Bosnians and Herzegovinans, that we are a defiant and brave country with which no one can play various political and geopolitical games.
Regardless of all the agreements and solutions at play currently, I am convinced that this proud country can achieve full democracy and protect the rights of every citizen.
The centuries-old history of our Bosnia and Herzegovina obliges us to do so, and that's why I want to say - Bosnia and Herzegovina has no price and is not for sale!
Once again, Happy renewed Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
95581,"Speech by BiH Presidency Member Dr. Denis Bećirović on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vijećnica, November 24, 2022.",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95581&langTag=en-US,2022-11-24,"Distinguished Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, dear friends,
We gathered to celebrate the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina or, to be more precise, the day of renewal of the Bosnian statehood. There is no reason why any citizen or people should not experience this date as their holiday. This is not a holiday that discriminates, endangers or excludes anyone. On the contrary, this is a national holiday that connects and affirms the human rights of all citizens and nations.
Unfortunately, in the post-Dayton period, it became common for one member of BiH Presidency not to attend the marking of the 25th of November. This is not good practice. Representatives of all citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina participated in the creation of far-reaching decisions of ZAVNOBiH. It is the immortal work of the most advanced people of that time. It is the indestructible legacy of Bosnian anti-fascists who were globally recognized and a deserving part of the world anti-fascist coalition. For these reasons, as well as numerous other, we are working sincerely and patiently to ensure that one day all three members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina jointly organize the celebration of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Denying the value of ZAVNOBiH is pointless and useless. Imagine that the Republic of France does not celebrate the 14th of July as a national holiday with the explanation that it refers to some other France. Or for the United States of America to erase the 4th of July from its memory. It is, of course, impossible to imagine. That is why current irrationalities and unsustainable reductionisms need to be explained to the new generations in our country as well. We must find the strength to bring the positive memory of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the surface and show people that the situation in the country does not have to be the way it is today.
We need to stop misinterpreting the term anti-fascism and reducing it from a civilizational level to an ideological level of meaning and use. Party and ideological disputes must not affect the importance of affirming anti-fascism. Anti-fascism is a civilizational, humanistic, and not an ideological category. It is one of the key postulates of modern society and is embedded in the foundations of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union.
Let's not forget to acknowledge and express gratitude to all anti-fascists in the 20th century that contributed to the restoration of statehood and the defence of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thanks to them, today we have the privilege of living in our own country, whose sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity are unquestionable. Thanks to them, Bosnia and Herzegovina is today a full member of the United Nations.
The ideas of ZAVNOBiH point to peace and tolerance. That is why these ideas are more relevant today than ever. The first session of ZAVNOBiH is a bright example of protest against hatred, fratricide and division. With its philosophy and spirit of peace and unity, ZAVNOBiH still designs the geopolitical space of Bosnia and Herzegovina today.
The messages of ZAVNOBiH are strong and inexhaustible. ZAVNOBiH is more than just a conference, more than one politically significant event. It is a date and an event of the highest order, an event that changed the course of history and brought new social forces and new political ideas onto the historical stage.
It would be incomplete to talk about ZAVNOBiH and not mention the importance of the Second Session of ZAVNOBiH. At this session, in the spirit of the libertarian political tradition of authentic national movements, such as the French Civil Revolution (1789) and the American Uprising for Independence (1776), which brought their declarations on the freedoms and rights of citizens, the ""Declaration of ZAVNOBiH"" was adopted on the rights of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is about one of the brightest documents adopted in the long history of our country. The declaration represents an inexhaustible source of inspiration in the fight for human rights and civil liberties.
The ideas and principles of ZAVNOBiH survive all attempts to destroy and disintegrate Bosnia and Herzegovina. The great historical significance of ZAVNOBiH lies in the fact that in BiH conglomerate of ethnic, religious, social and other elements found a point of synthesis and all-Bosnian integration. It is time to understand the essential message of ZAVNOBiH and find a point of synthesis in the XXI century.
Challenging the continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a Sisyphean task. In the last thousand years, our country has survived what no other country could. And, despite everything, she survived. Bosnia and Herzegovina has always had the strength to withstand even the heaviest attacks and to defiantly and proudly stand tall. Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the most stable and durable European countries.
It's time to ask some serious questions: What are we doing in the communities where we can to truly affirm the messages and values of ZAVNOBiH? What are we doing within the educational system and cultural reproduction to promote ZAVNOBiH? We should not talk about ZAVNOBiH in an inert, uninspiring and inertial way. The 25th of November should be talked about with new scientific achievements, new scientific elaborations and serious political understanding of ZAVNOBiH.
Unfortunately, we often waste energy and scarce resources on secondary historical phenomena and events. It is time to start dealing with essential issues of importance for the past, present and future. It's time for new ideas and serious projects. Among other things, we should seriously consider establishing the ZAVNOBiH Institute. It is time to raise ZAVNOBiH to the top of the value pyramid because it has a huge untapped potential to be the Bosnian Piedmont that gathers new generations with the idea of living together.
In order for a peaceful and successful Bosnia and Herzegovina to develop, it is necessary that integrative aspirations and policies become dominant in our homeland. Integrity cannot be imposed; it can only be established by the political will of all citizens and nations. Democracy and integration in Bosnia and Herzegovina are inseparable. They are two sides of the same process.
A country made up of different ethnic groups cannot be integrated by one ethnic group. Such a situation can exist in a mono-ethnic country, but it cannot exist in a historically formed state of multi-ethnic composition and character.
Progressive forces must persistently and patiently build a more positive social environment in our country that will bring forth good for all people. Let's act responsibly with a view to the future. People all over our beautiful country are looking for peace, economic development and a better standard of living. In order to meet their expectations, we must speed up Bosnia and Herzegovina's path to full membership in the EU and NATO. We are working together to build a more favourable business environment that will attract foreign investors and encourage domestic investors to invest capital in our country.
Our homeland needs statesmen who are ready to fight for the realization of the dream, the vision of a European and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, eager for the future, aware of their past. We need brave leaders who will have the strength to tell society the truth and fight against injustice. Determined and organized people do not complain but change the environment as tireless initiators of positive changes.
Let us believe in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We work diligently to make our country a source of good ideas and positive projects. Bosnia and Herzegovina can be a point of convergence and rapprochement, a driver of peace and development projects. Let the positive achievements of the past be an additional inspiration for us to build the Bosnia and Herzegovina of the future.
Let's tell the new generations that there are no impossible goals. There are those who believe in positive ideas and those who do not. There are optimists and pessimists. We believe, we are optimists.
Happy Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
95460,The speech delivered by Chairwoman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željka Cvijanović at the constitutive session of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95460&langTag=en-US,2022-11-16,"Respected members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the old and new convocations, Dear President of the Republika Srpska, Respected presidents of the governments of Republika Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the House of Representatives and the House of Peoples, Representatives of institutions at state, entity and other levels of government, Respected representatives of religious communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Your Excellencies, ambassadors, representatives of the diplomatic corps and international organizations in Bosnia and Herzegovina Dear citizens, Ladies and gentlemen,
It is an honour to have the opportunity to address you, for the first time as a Serb member, and at the same time as the Chairwoman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I have been elected to this responsible position, as is a well-known fact, by the citizens of Republika Srpska, to whom I would firstly like to express my gratitude for their enormous support and trust.
In the last elections, they gave me the mandate to represent their interests in the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and defend the constitutional position of both Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I come to the Presidency with open arms, with good intentions. I wish for us to work together, in accordance with our constitutional competences, for the benefit of both entities and all peoples in BiH, as well as other citizens, and not to anyone's detriment.
We desperately need dialogue on all the open issues that weigh on our daily lives. Both within the Presidency and other state institutions, as well as with legislative and executive governments at the level of the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I believe that, in these globally complex circumstances, each of us will contribute to the search for solutions to existing problems.
I believe that we are politically mature enough to determine our own priorities, and not have solutions imposed on us by anyone from the outside. That's why I want us to be subjects of decision-making, and not mere objects or recipients of interventions, because we live in a country that belongs equally to all of us and in which we, elected by the people, are accountable to the people for what has been done or not done. Because if we want to be respected by others, then we primarily must have more respect for ourselves.
There are many things on which we disagree within Bosnia and Herzegovina and this is nothing new. But the measure of our success will be precisely in finding the lowest common denominator and directing our forces towards those goals that are equally important for everyone.
I am an advocate of discussing all important issues, but in practice that we primarily deal with common priorities, and those issues that we know in advance that there is no agreement of everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I believe that it is necessary to improve our relations and build bridges of cooperation both within Bosnia and Herzegovina and with countries in the region. Primarily with Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro, with whom we share a border, but also with North Macedonia, Slovenia and others in the region and beyond.
It is important that in these challenging times we accept every development opportunity that presents itself to us, that together with neighbouring countries we participate in all regional initiatives that can bring benefits to our economy and citizens.
That is why I will strongly advocate for additional strengthening of regional cooperation within the Berlin process, but also for full participation in the Open Balkans initiative. In this sense, I am ready to clarify everything that is necessary, but also to listen to the explanations of other participants who are competent to decide on these issues, in order to reach a harmonized position.
One of the strategic commitments is the continuation on the European path, and the first task of institutions at all levels is certainly to obtain candidate status for EU membership. It is not possible to implement this work without close coordination of different levels of government, therefore I believe that it is necessary to rehabilitate the coordination system that would enable us to move forward in a systematic and organized manner.
I particulary wish to highlight that in the context of European integration, but also in all other processes that we will implement, it is of crucial importance that we consistently respect the Dayton Peace Agreement and the constitutional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is a framework that provided us with peace, but also clearly determined the position and responsibilities of different levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The assumption of the rule of law is respect for the highest legal and political act of a country, without which there is neither a functional legal state nor an orderly system.
And that is exactly what we should primarily strive for, both in the BiH Presidency and in other institutions at all levels of government, because otherwise we would only have disorder, divergence and separation.
At this point, I am obliged to clarify my position regarding the participation of a foreign factor in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Carrying out important functions for many years and taking into account all the stages this country has gone through, I understand that good cooperation between national institutions and foreign representatives is necessary. However, democracy will come to life in its full capacity, and internal dialogue and mutual trust will strengthen only when national institutions fully take responsibility for all processes.
It is no secret, nor is it unknown, that I do not believe in the benefits of forcible interventionism by a foreign factor, but that I exclusively believe in dialogue and cooperation.
Just as I do not believe that the abuse or usurpation of constitutional powers on the foreign policy front can help Bosnia and Herzegovina, I also do not believe that foreign judges in the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, high representatives or foreign micro-managers can help us live in a more successful country.
But, on the other hand, I believe that internal dialogue can help us overcome problems both internally and externally, and as a member of the BiH Presidency, I am ready to contribute to building such a dialogue.
I congratulate my colleagues in the Presidency and all the newly elected representatives of the people in both entities and at the state level, with a wish to, in the next four years, justify the trust that has been given to us.
Thank you!"
95455,The speech delivered by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the constitutive session of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95455&langTag=en-US,2022-11-16,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed guests from the country and abroad, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
I am addressing you with a sense of sincere pride, gratitude and responsibility for the high duty I am assuming. I understand the trust of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was given to me during the elections, as an obligation to represent all those democratic values that we inherit as citizens and that we preserve as a state.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank my colleagues for their cooperation in the previous mandate of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Šefik Džaferović and Mr. Milorad Dodik.
The conduct of the duties of a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina entrusted to me will be devoid of partial party or any individual or group interests. The election to this position, and the Constitution of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, obliges me to treat all citizens of our country equally. This is also my personal committment not only a constitutional obligation.
All activities that I undertake as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be directed towards the unity of the state and in accordance with the priorities defined by the decisions of the institutions of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The feeling of belonging to this country as our common good, its difficult but glorious past, faith in its future, faith in the generations to come, is my motive. By working in the general interest of all citizens and in the interest of the state, I wish to, together with everyone, try to make the country offer better living conditions, the country of hope and the country that can fulfil the dreams of the best among us.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be sure that I will not spare either myself or those whom I have chosen to work with, to work towards this goal every day.
In this same place four years ago, taking the oath for the past mandate, I said that I would not miss an opportunity that might arise, to unblock the process of NATO integration through the activation of MAP.
That opportunity presented itself, and the Reform Program was delivered to the NATO headquarters in Brussels, first by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and then by the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am pround of that fact.
I, therefore, would like to use this address to higlight that I will not miss the opportunity to do everything in my power, even beyond, to take the last step towards Bosnia and Herzegovina's full membership in the NATO alliance, if such a possibility presents itself because the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the NATO alliance is a primary foreign political priority.
The destruction of the implementation of 14 priorities from the European Commission Opinion on the candidate status for membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Union, and the gross ignorance of the European Court of Human Rights' judgements, unfortunately threatens to make Bosnia and Herzegovina's European path a secondary foreign policy priority, given the extent of violations of the European standards and principles, especially regarding the equality of citizens before the law and the Constitution.
For my part, I will make all the necessary efforts, and use all the mechanisms provided by the Constitution, so that the perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in the European Union is not permanently destroyed.
In this, I will need the support of all well-intentioned citizens and political options in Bosnia and Herzegovina who still believe that the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European Union is one of the primary foreign policy priorities.
While respecting the Constitution of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I use the opportunity to remind you of its evolutionary nature, that is, the fact that the Constitution itself foresees the possibility of upgrading to a system of complete democracy and all its values.
The fulfilment of the European Commission Opinion obligations urges us to do precisely that. The fullfiment of obligations are teh best tool in achieving equality of all citizens.
No one can take away the right to democracy from the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I will resolutely oppose all such attempts because I am obliged to do so by the trust shown by all those people who believe in a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In terms of foreign policy withing the United Nations, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I will strive to keep Bosnia and Herzegovina on the side of those countries that respect international law and the principle of the inviolability of internationally recognized borders, in other words, on the side of the democratic and civilized order opposed to any form of aggression and violence.
Taught by its own historical experience, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue, through the United Nations, the Council of Europe and other international associations, to be the state that will not take a neutral position in matters of the conflict between civilization and anti-civilization.
I have only one but simple message for our neighbours. We will respect you as much as you respect the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Bosnia and Herzegovina owes nothing to anyone, and many owe a lot to it. The days of all kinds of justifications just because we want and want to live in our normal, peaceful and prosperous country are long gone.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its institutions will certainly be a reliable regional partner for all those who want peace, economic and any other social development through the relevant international agreements that we have signed in the past period.
Personally, as an official who has been entrusted by the citizens to represent them in the highest state institution, I will remain committed to the idea of ​​equality for all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of their ethnic, religious or other identity origin, as well as the values ​​of anti-fascism on which the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina was built.
All citizens can find in me, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a faithful ally in advocating for such values, as well as an ally in the fight against all forms of corruption and nepotism.
My intention is to finally free the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the choice between the feeling of love for the homeland and the feeling of systematic injustice. I will invest all my energy and integrity in building a just state in which there is room for all its citizens.
Thank you."
95450,The speech delivered by BiH Presidency Member Dr. Denis Bećirović at the constitutive session of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95450&langTag=en-US,2022-11-16,"Dear citizens, People of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Members of the BiH Presidency, Excellencies, Eminencies, Honored guests, Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the trust you have given me. On October 2, more than 330.000 people voted in my favor of becoming a member of the Presidency of BiH. I feel an enormous responsibility toward the people of this country, and to the country itself, and it is a great honor as well.
We took an oath that we will conscientiously perform the duty entrusted to us, as well as protect the human rights of all nations and citizens. Let's protect and strengthen the values of a democratic society and social solidarity. Let’s defend the freedom and dignity of every person in our country. Let's respect and implement the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the decisions of international and domestic courts. Let’s change what is bad, what divides and discriminates all of us. Let's do everything in our power to help people live better lives.
Deep roots and strong anti-fascist foundations of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with deep medieval roots and strong anti-fascist foundations. To this day, anti-fascist values mean advocacy for democracy, human rights, and social justice. A concise assessment of our country's past can be expressed in one sentence that reads: All the great deeds in the long history of this country were done together, all the great tragedies were committed by those who tried to break us apart.
United on life's great questions and the future
We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it. We must direct our energy towards fixing the substandard present and building the foundation for a more secure future. For a better quality of life, all levels of the government should be focused on solving the existential issues.
All of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina have common opponents such as poverty, unemployment, injustice, and mass departure of people from our country, especially the youth. These opponents do not know political, ethnic, religious, and other differences and they endanger all people equally. It is crucial that we act responsibly together in order to confront the actual problems.
The vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina
My vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina is that of a democratic, legal, and European country. A country where ethnic, religious, regional, social, and other identities are freely developed and respected, which altogether build the common identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a vision of a free, open, multi-ethnic, European, creative, and an attractive country for investment.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a secure future
Let's build the future together and strengthen the security of the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Drawn from experience: for peace and economic development, we need everyone in our country, for conflict and destabilization we don't need all. Let us strive to the politics of peace, cooperation, and strengthen the economic foundations.
Politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina must turn from selfishness and investment in their own popularity and benefit. Let's work for the interests of impoverished and disenfranchised ones. Let's not build political popularity on quarrels and conflicts. Only the seeds of misery and unhappiness can sprout from inflicting threats and tensions.
People dream about a peaceful life and growth
People dream of their children building the future of our country. They wonder how it is that young people from our country can work and live together in the West whereas here, the politicians teach them the opposite. Let us help people get closer to their dreams. Those dreams are reachable if we collectively become better than we used to be.
Cooperation and decisiveness policy
I am holding out a cooperation hand to all who wish well for the people of our country. At the same time, I will be determined to defend the democratic, legal, European and multi-ethnic country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no legal, political, moral, historical, or civilizational basis for contesting the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Responsible and courageous statesmen build peace and stability
What people need today are responsible and brave statesmen. Nowadays, courage is shown by standing up for peace and the human rights of every human being. Strength is expressed through cooperation and dialogue, not insults and threats. It is time to draw the line and admit that strife and division are the roads to poverty and isolation. It is time to rise above quarrels and anger to make the most of the present and build a better future.
Accelerate the path toward EU and NATO membership
Our strategic goals are full membership in the European Union (EU) and NATO. National competent authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina unanimously adopted these objectives. Legally adopted decisions and laws of competent state authorities must be respected as in any other country. The rule of law and respect for the continuity of the decisions made are fundamental requirements for stability and development.
EU membership is a great challenge. We must demonstrate the ability to succeed in the large and demanding European market, thereby fully embracing the democratic values of a united Europe. It is of great importance to prepare our economy on this path by improving knowledge, science and implementing new technologies while respecting the sustainable development goals.
The new parliamentary majority at the national level should rapidly implement the recommendations of the European Commission. Let us do everything we can in the upcoming weeks so that Bosnia and Herzegovina moves closer to becoming the candidate for EU membership in December this year. I believe that granting candidate status would be a powerful message and an additional initiative to intensify our European path.
Let's coordinate the foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU
Let's be persistent in fulfilling the undertaken contractual obligations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU, and let's continue and improve the alignment of Bosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy with the statements, declarations, and common positions of the European Union. We are part of the free and democratic world and are committed to the values on which it is based. Accordingly, we undoubtedly contribute to security and stability, both in Europe and the whole world.
Our historical experience brings forward a great amount of empathy for the suffering of others. Today, people in Ukraine and elsewhere are suffering. Let's show our full solidarity with them.
Let’s work to ensure that, with increased cooperation with EU and NATO member states, Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to develop good relations and all-around ties with numerous friendly countries on all meridians and parallels.
Regional cooperation has no other alternative
Regional cooperation is one of the primary interests of the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an important prerequisite for EU integration. Good relations with neighbors guarantee peace, stability, the opening of trade relations, investments, growth of tourism, culture, sports, education, and any other kind of cooperation with the neighbouring countries. Respect for international law, equal cooperation, and partnership in the region can result in the prosperity of the entire region.
I say to the benevolent people in the region that they have sincere friends and reliable partners in the citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, from Sarajevo, I am sending a special message to the people of Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, and the entire region, which states: let's declare together the 21st century an era of peace and development by engaging into the finest economic cooperation as well as any other form of cooperation.
Let's continue with the reforms of the defense system under the NATO standards
An efficient and qualified defense system must serve the general, personal as well as property rights and security of people in our country. We must continue to reform the defense system under NATO standards. We are bound by international agreements and the adopted Law on the Defense of BiH, as well as the decisions of responsible state institutions. In the period ahead, even greater challenges will be faced, including the continuation of reforms, and their implementation, but also the realization of expected obligations and defined tasks. To achieve this, a high degree of functionality, efficiency, and professionalism of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is necessary, which should be interoperable with NATO and capable of realizing the statutory mission.
Let's connect Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Diaspora
Millions of our fellow citizens live and work all around the world. They haven't forgotten Bosnia and Herzegovina and we must not forget them. They are a massive involving force and genuine partners in building the future of our country. Let's make a deeper connection between our people in the homeland and the diaspora.
Let's strengthen the connective tissue of our multi-ethnic state
We live in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country. It is a treasure. Let's strengthen the connective tissue of Bosnia and Herzegovina, connect nations and citizens, and work for the benefit of our country. Let's come up with a policy of returning all citizens and people to their homeland. Bosnia and Herzegovina must be a house where the rule of law, democracy, and human rights reside.
Let's bring back optimism and positive energy
Let's leave apathy and pessimism in the past, and bring optimism and determination in the present. Let's bring back some positive energy to our society and open up to positive changes. None of us can do it alone. Therefore, let's affirm the joint work of authorities at all levels. By working together, we can build a better world for all.
Let’s build the Bosnia and Herzegovina of the future
Let's break new ground and build Bosnia and Herzegovina of the future. Let’s work for our country and every benevolent person. Let's reject monologue and arguments, let's affirm dialogue and cooperation. Let’s serve the people and our country. We are all sons and daughters of Bosnia and Herzegovina. May our mother Bosnia and Herzegovina live forever! A country of equal nations and citizens. The country of the future.
Thank you for your attention!"
95227,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Šefik Džaferović, at the commemoration of the anniversary of the death of the first President of the Presidency of the Republic of",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95227&langTag=en-US,2022-10-19,"Dear members of Alija Izetbegović's family, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I feel honored and proud to have known the late Alija Izetbegović. I feel honored and proud to have been his collaborator. Because I was and remain his follower. I feel an exceptional moral duty and social privilege, that today, in the capacity of Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in this place, I speak about Alija Izetbegović.
Dear friends,
Alija Izetbegović's name evokes an inexhaustible number of topics, because of his peculiar personality and he is one of the most significant people in the history of this country. Certainly the most significant personality in the recent history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Alija Izetbegović's name evokes an inexhaustible number of topics, but today I will talk about three.
About his character. About his fight for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. About his fight for the Bosniak people.
First, about character. I knew late President Izetbegović personally and I cannot but be personal when I talk about him. As a young man, I was his associate. I had the opportunity to talk with him day after day, closely observe his actions and his attitude towards people.
What I knew about Alija Izetbegović as a Bosniak and an ordinary citizen, I further confirmed by working alongside him.
Alija Izetbegović was a president, thinker, writer, humanist, lawyer.
However, one word best sums up the impressions we all felt before the late president.
Alija Izetbegović was a statesman. In the true sense of the word.
Although he was also a politician, Alija Izetbegović is not remembered as a politician, but as a statesman.
Politicians dream of power. Statesmen watch over the fate of the country and people.
Politicians only think about the next election. Statesmen think about future generations.
For politicians, power is the goal. For statesmen, it is only a tool.
Alija Izetbegović was a statesman. Because power for him was a means to do something good. Because he watched over the fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosniak people. Because he was thinking about the generations to come.
Alija Izetbegović was a statesman, because he was a man of thought, but also of action. There are politicians who think a lot, but do not act. There are also those who act a lot, but without much thought. Alija Izetbegović was a statesman, because he thought and acted.
Dear friends,
Now I will say something more about the second and third topic - about the fight of President Izetbegović for the state and for the Bosniak people.
He was a statesman, because he shared the fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina and his people.
He was 65 years old when he was elected president of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He remembered the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the Cvetković-Maček agreement.
He survived the Second World War, which Bosniaks faced without their own state. He remembered the crimes against Bosniaks and the attempts to assimilate us.
He fought on the side of the Partisans, although he was not a communist, like many other Bosniaks.
He truly believed that Bosnia and Herzegovina belonged to all its peoples. That's why he protested when the new authorities betrayed the formula of ZAVNOBiH and pushed aside the Bosniaks, who were then named after their religion.
He always emphasized that this country belongs to all its nations and people. He emphasized that everyone has the right to love her, even when they didn't.
He knew that Bosniaks, due to their historical destiny, are tied to the destiny of Bosnia and Herzegovina by an umbilical cord. But he never, I repeat - he never denied Serbs and Croats the right to feel Bosnia and Herzegovina as their own.
He fought so that no one would be uncomfortable in this country and in his own skin.
Convinced that different peoples can and should live together, he fought for different opinions to be confronted in public. He was a staunch democrat to the end. He said that the right of the stronger is not a right, but a fact. He said that true law was created to protect the weak. He said that freedom of thought is primarily the freedom to think differently.
And then a paradox happened. He who fought for coexistence was accused of doing the opposite. He who fought for freedom of thought was accused of doing the opposite.
He was sentenced twice, for words and thoughts. The first time as a young man, and the second time as a mature man. Both times he preserved his dignity, knowing that there are times when a free man has no choice but to be a prisoner.
The people understood that, after the Sarajevo process. Despite the regime's intentions, the process turned into its opposite. The intention was to convince the Bosniak people not to follow Alija Izetbegović. And the opposite happened.
The people always followed Alija Izetbegović. Even during the communism. As a manager of large construction sites, he led projects on which half a thousand workers worked. It is known how much influence his articles in Preporod had on Bosniak intellectuals and ulema of that time.
When he came to power, there was no revanchism. Even some of his interrogators testified about this. He knew that the motive of his persecutors was to divide the people and therefore he did not want to follow their path.
He followed another path. His thought, which was formed primarily on the Holy Qur'an, and then on the highest achievements of Western philosophy, refined by folk wisdom and experience, was a light and a guide for the Bosniak people, who were facing the most turbulent period in modern history.
Dear friends,
As I said, Alija Izetbegović was 65 years old when he became the president of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Up to that point, he had lived through almost everything a man can live through in his lifetime. But in the following ten years he lived more and more.
Independence and international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Siege of Sarajevo and genocide throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Double aggression. Embargo.
Creation and strengthening of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Various peace negotiations.
The solidarity of friends in the world, and the cynicism of those who were not.
Liberation actions of the RBiH Army.
July 11, which he said was the greatest calamity that could happen in our lifetimes.
The intervention of the international community.
And finally – the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Throughout the entire period of aggression, and especially at the very beginning and end, he bore the greatest burden of responsibility. But he was always up to the task. He always questioned his views, listened to others, consulted, but defended what he believed in with great strength. We should never forget that this is a man who paid for his beliefs with his freedom.
Explaining the responsibility of statesmen, he once said: ""History is not a laboratory, so try out several possibilities and monitor the results. You can only do what you're about to do once.""
The decision to start gaining independence passed the test of history.
Acceptance of the Dayton Peace Accords – passed the test of history.
Both of these decisions were historically correct and necessary. The violent destruction of Yugoslavia was not the will of Alija Izetbegović, but the will of others. And the will of others is an objective circumstance. After becoming the head of a country that was attacked from outside and inside, he made the best decision - Bosnia and Herzegovina started the path of independence.
The ultimate goal of the aggressors was to overturn this decision. Alija Izetbegović never agreed to it. From the Carrington and Cutilier plans, through the Vance-Owen and Owen-Stoltenberg plans, until the Dayton Agreement, he never agreed to annul the independence and integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He did not consider the Dayton Peace just, but he considered it more just than the continuation of the war. In the world as it is, with power relations as they are, a better peace could not be achieved. Our problem was not that we accepted the American peace initiative, but that it did not happen earlier and that it was not fairer. With the imposed embargo, the cynicism of the world and the double aggression of our neighbors, we did not have enough strength for a complete victory. But we didn't even lose. We got a chance to win in peace, which we did by strengthening and building state institutions.
Dear friends,
The strategy of the anti-state forces, after reluctantly accepting the Dayton Peace, was to tire us and the world. But they tired themselves. First, because we, with the support of our friends, were stronger. Second, because the destruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not in the interest of any nation.
Not shying away from telling hard truths, the late president once said that Bosnia and Herzegovina is what the Bosniak people want most at this moment. But he added that it should not be imagined without the Serbian and Croatian people. The same as without other peoples, who have been living here for centuries.
On another occasion, the late president said that the solution to all our problems is a complete and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina. ""Comprehensive"" - means to reduce ethnic divisions, and ""democratic"" - to develop a division of opinion within each nation, instead of between them.
Dear friends,
I was recently in the Czech Republic, at the summit of the European Political Community. Our people, who live in the Czech Republic, reminded me of one detail, with which I will end.
What Alija Izetbegović is for us, Vaclav Havel is for the Czechs.
A month before the signing of the Dayton Agreement, Vaclav Havel gave unconditional support to the legal authorities and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, comparing the fate of our country with that of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and strongly condemning attempts to equalize the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Asked what he thought about the political views of Alija Izetbegović, Havel said that he hardly saw the difference between his and Izetbegović's views, adding that in conversations with him he became convinced that the Bosnian side wants democracy, civil coexistence of different peoples and religions, which is the cornerstone of modern civilization .
I heard an almost identical assessment of the late president from numerous other statesmen in all corners of the world.
Alija Izetbegović, his thought, as well as the fate of Bosnia and Herzegovina, were one of the rare issues on which both West and East agreed, and that is no small matter.
Let us be aware of it forever.
Let's be grateful to God for the country and the freedom we have, and work hard to make our situation better.
Let us be forever proud that we had Alija Izetbegović and that we follow his path.
Thank you for your attention!

95047,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Šefik Džaferović, at the general debate of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, 21st September, 2022",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=95047&langTag=en-US,2022-09-21,"Mr. Speaker,
Secretary General,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor to address this respected body, as the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I congratulate Mr. Shahid on successfully presiding over the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Together with the Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Guterres, he worked dedicatedly so that this body of the United Nations could carry out its duties, despite the difficult conditions caused by the pandemic.
I also congratulate Mr. Kőrösi on his election as the chairman of the 77th session of the General Assembly. You can count on the support and cooperation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in ensuring the productive work of this body.
Dear President,
In recent years, at the sessions of the General Assembly and other international forums, we have regularly assessed that the global order is experiencing tectonic changes. Today, however, we can conclude that the world has been irreversibly changed. Relations, on which rested the security architecture of Europe as well as the wider international framework, have become a thing of the past.
At a time when towns and villages in Ukraine are facing the terrifying reality of war, the least we can do is not to be silent about it. We must not be silent, especially in this building. In the United Nations, which was established with the aim of preventing and stopping what is currently happening in Ukraine. Finally, we in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who ourselves have a vivid memory of the horrors of war and aggression, must not be silent.
As in the case of my country, in the period between 1992 and 1995, the United Nations system, unfortunately, was again unable to prevent or stop the war in Ukraine. I am primarily referring to the Security Council, as a body responsible for the protection of international peace and security, in light of the principles defined by the Charter of the United Nations.
Unlike the Security Council, which, due to internal relations and blockades, is evidently unable to fulfill its obligations, the General Assembly of the United Nations, by an overwhelming majority, adopted a resolution on aggression against Ukraine.
The aforementioned resolution of this body confirmed the unquestionable principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other acts of international law, which prohibit the use of armed force and order states to resolve disagreements by peaceful means.
Support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine was expressed, and the actions of the Russian Federation were unequivocally called aggression, and a request was made to stop it. The secessionist moves of certain regions within Ukraine directed against its territorial integrity were also rejected.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supported this resolution and stood on the right side of history, together with 140 other countries, and in accordance with the obligations from the UN Charter, our previously held positions and our obligation, according to the Stabilization and Association Agreement, to follow the foreign policy of the European Union.
Although this resolution does not have the power to stop the war, it does have the power to stop lies. The clear and unambiguous language of this highest international forum reduces the space to the extreme for all those who try to twist the truth. The first step towards any solution is to tell the truth and respect it.
I express my hope that there will be peace as soon as possible, so that people in Ukraine can live normally and so that the displaced can return to their homes.
Dear President,
The war in Ukraine, as well as the consequences of the pandemic, led to enormous changes in all spheres of life. At the current moment, this is mostly expressed through a deep energy crisis, inflation, a general recession and the threat to supplies, especially when it comes to food. We all have a very difficult and challenging winter ahead of us.
The global market and international free trade have enabled enormous progress in all corners of the world. The eradication of hunger, the availability of consumer goods, continuous economic growth in all corners of the world, these are all unquestionable benefits of global economic liberalization.
By tightly connecting various parts of the globe, globalization has made us interdependent. Strong economic, security and political interrelations have produced an increasingly integrated global framework, in which everyone relies on each other, in various spheres, ranging from the economy to security.
At the same time, the interdependence of different parts of the world is the source of the vulnerability of the global community. This was shown by the pandemic, when traffic and supply channels were blocked. This is also shown by the current crisis, related to the war in Ukraine, when due to the blockade of wheat exports from Ukrainian ports, hunger threatens developing countries on the African and Asian continents. Or, as it is the case today when most of the European continent is facing an energy crisis due to dependence on Russian gas.
Due to some difficulties caused by the process of political and economic integration, in the past years we have often witnessed the advocacy of political sovereignty and economic protectionism. The consequences of the transformation of developed countries from industrial to post-industrial, then migration and finally pandemics, were the reason for many to advocate for the erection of economic and even literal walls and wire fences.
It's a stray path. The solution to the mentioned problems is not to close, but to open. The solution is not to cooperate less, but cooperate more. The solution to the energy crisis in Europe, caused by dependence on one source, is not only relying on one's own force, but in diversification, finding new, multiple channels of supply of gas and other energy sources.
No one in the modern world has enough resources to be able to rely only on themselves, and the past crises show that even dependence on individual external sources is not enough. Both of these difficulties can only be overcome through even greater international cooperation.
Dear President,
We live in unstable times, unprecedented in recent history. While we await an extremely difficult winter, we are aware of the destabilizing potential of the economic and energy crisis.
The 20th century provides extremely valuable lessons about the connection between economic crisis and right-wing populism. It was on the wave of great economic depression that the Nazi movement came to power, which led to the greatest cataclysm in the history of mankind, after which the United Nations was established, and the UN Charter was adopted, and then the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on preventing and punishing genocide, as well as other UN acts.
The essential idea of the United Nations, on which all these fundamental acts of international law rest, is the idea of the equality of all people, regardless of their origin, skin color, religious, national or other affiliation. This is the idea on which modern civilization is built.
Now, almost eight decades later, we can hear voices openly or implicitly denying those fundamental tenets. More and more often, right-wing populists say that all people and nations do not have equal rights, that some are more valuable than others. More and more often, they openly advocate the ideas of ethnic and racial supremacy, as well as that domination and bare force is the only principle on which interpersonal and international relations can and should be structured. From these ideas to violence is only one step away.
From this place, from the United Nations building, I call for caution and action. In the coming period, we will face huge challenges. We must fulfil our duty, and fight for civilized ideas. We must defend them, at all costs.
Dear President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been home to many peoples, cultures and religions for centuries. We are proud of our long tradition of multiculturalism. We are proud of our Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Roma and other communities, as well as the culture of living together and mutual respect that we have developed over the centuries. All these communities are individually and collectively part of the Bosnian state mosaic and will remain being so.
At the same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a meeting place of cultures, was a thorn in the side of politics, which are based on the idea of the impossibility of living together and the necessity of confrontation. Such policies led to a terrifying war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 1992 to 1995, which culminated in the genocide in Srebrenica.
In the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations from the mentioned period, as well as in the reports of the UN Secretary General, and finally in the judgments of the International Criminal Court based in The Hague, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is qualified as an international armed conflict, with the participation of neighbouring countries.
In the judgments of the Hague Criminal Tribunal, it was concluded that joint criminal enterprises were conducted, with the aim of eliminating certain ethnic groups from parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so that these territories would ultimately be annexed to neighbouring countries, which committed the most serious violation of international general and humanitarian law.
Since the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina has gone through an arduous path in building peace. However, there are still numerous challenges, the biggest of which are the policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbourhood, which have not given up on the war goals of dividing the country.
As part of a broader wave of right-wing populism in Europe, there are politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina who openly claim that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not possible, because, as they point out, it is not possible for Muslims and Christians to live together.
Muslims and Christians live and can live together. And such life has a perspective. And what certainly has no perspective are the retrograde policies that oppose it.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its centuries-old history, is a living example and proof of the civilized idea that people of different religions, nations and cultures can live together. The fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina, even despite the war that was aimed at its destruction, managed to survive shows its exceptional resilience.
The majority of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in peace with their differences, and there is enough strength for such a Bosnia and Herzegovina to win. I am convinced that it will be so.
Dear President,
The experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that the rule of law is a crucial factor for building peace. The work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which was formed by the UN, provided victims with a minimum of justice, and sent a message to criminals that their actions will not go unpunished, and that they will be brought to justice and bear the consequences for their actions.
Furthermore, other bodies of the international community, primarily the Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council, made a huge contribution to peace building and protection.
Both bodies were established on the basis of Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations, which mandates the intervention of the international community for the purpose of protecting peace, and their establishment was also confirmed by relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Accordingly, their closure is possible only with a new decision of the Security Council, and it is not yet time for that.
Allow me to remind you that in significantly developed countries, such as Germany, there was international supervision, with much greater executive powers than the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it was extinguished after 45 years of existence, when the prerequisites for it were created.
Over the past 27 years, the Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council have assisted domestic political actors in implementing reforms. Thanks to joint efforts, we managed to unite the three once warring armies into a single Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also united the three intelligence services, the tax system, the judiciary, etc.
Thanks to these reforms, that is, the existence of the Armed Forces and other state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, even after the gradual withdrawal of 60,000 international troops, peace has been preserved.
In the past little more than a year, in Bosnia and Herzegovina there was an attack on the 27 years of implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, through an attempt to dissolve the state institutions that were established based on the clear provisions of the Dayton Agreement.
Thanks to the action of the Office of the High Representative and the member states of the Peace Implementation Council, led by the United States of America, the attack on state institutions was stopped and peace was preserved, which demonstrated the expediency and efficiency of the institutions of the international community in BiH.
In the past period, in addition to requests for the closure of the OHR, requests for the High Representative to take steps that would weaken the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and introduce additional ethnic divisions are becoming more frequent. The obligation of the High Representative, according to the Dayton Agreement and the UN Charter, is to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and not to contribute to its disintegration.
Dear president,
In addition to the civilian presence, in Bosnia and Herzegovina also there is an international military presence, in the form of the EUFOR mission and the NATO headquarters, with a total of 1,100 members. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not specific in that respect either, because many, much more developed, also sovereign states have a need for the presence of international military forces, in a much larger number than is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The international military presence was established by the Dayton Peace Agreement, and the Security Council confirms EUFOR's mandate every year.
In less than a month, there will be a new vote in the Security Council on the EUFOR mandate. It is very important for peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region that this resolution is adopted, but it is worth emphasizing that in any case, according to the Dayton Agreement, the NATO alliance has the right and obligation to deploy its forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Also, there are decisions of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina which give consent to the presence of EUFOR and NATO forces, without a time limit, and these decisions are a sufficient legal basis for the presence of an international military mission in BiH, until the Presidency of BiH takes a different position.
Dear President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy goals are membership in the European Union and the NATO alliance.
At the session of the European Council in June of this year, space was opened for granting Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. In the past period, Bosnia and Herzegovina made some progress in fulfilling 14 priorities from the European Commission's Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina's application for EU membership. We achieved some priorities in full, and others partially. It is good news that, in the past weeks, we have continued to fulfil those priorities.
I expect that, after the general elections that will be held on October 2 of this year, BiH will continue on this path even more strongly and get the status of a candidate for EU membership as soon as possible.
When it comes to relations with the NATO alliance, Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of the Action Plan for membership. The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Program of Reforms, with which Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfils its obligations, on an annual level, when it comes to the reforms that the NATO alliance expects from us, as an aspirant state.
Dear President,
The foreign policy goal of Bosnia and Herzegovina is also regional cooperation. Bosnia and Herzegovina wants good relations with its neighbours, with mutual appreciation, respect and the principle of reciprocity. And that is the only way to build good relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Everyone in the region must understand that the geostrategic and geopolitical configuration of the region is complete, and that the path to security and prosperity is a path of mutual cooperation and solving open issues, in accordance with the principles of international law.
Everyone in the region is equal, no one can dominate anyone, and everyone needs peace and stability.
Dear Chairman,
The whole world needs peace and stability. All current disputes in the world should be resolved on the principles of international law and with the participation of international justice institutions. That is why it is very important to strengthen multilateral mechanisms and institutions. In this sense, I believe that the strength and authority of the UN as a key multilateral mechanism must be strengthened.
Thank you for your attention."

Respected families of shaheeds and fallen soldiers, representatives of veterans' associations, members of the Organizing Committee for the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the formation of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected representatives of the executive and legislative authorities at all levels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Excellences, respected attendees,
I express my gratitude to the Organizing Committee of today's manifestation for their perseverance and efforts to preserve the memory of the heroic journey of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the achievements of the defense and liberation war 1992 – 1995.
Celebrating the 30th anniversary of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is another confirmation of such efforts, which should be an honor to each of your members, as well as to all of us.
I send special thanks and respect to the families of the shaheeds and fallen fighters of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today we remember them with the wish that the goals of their struggle remain permanently recorded. We will not forget them. We will not forget their sacrifice and that time of the greatest trial for our homeland.
It was not only the defense of human lives and territory, but a battle for the existence and idea of this country. They preserved it with their lives. And that will remain permanently recorded.
Dear attendees,
The latest aggression against the statehood and integrity of our homeland is the freshest testimony of the sacrifice that the citizens of Sarajevo and all of Bosnia and Herzegovina were ready to make.
In the complete political, informational and economic blockade to which the capital of our country was exposed throughout the aggression, in an extremely difficult and complex military-political situation, thanks to the members of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of BiH, Sarajevo was defended, and with it the belief that we will preserve the integrity of this country.
In the most difficult moments of the fight for the defense of the capital and the survival of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina led by Generals Mustafa Hajrulahović, Vahid Karavelić and Nedžad Ajnadžić gave their best sons. Among them are the late Safet Hadžić, Enver Šehović and Safet Zajko, heroes of the defense and liberation war. At the time of the most difficult moments for Sarajevo and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they believed in its survival and final victory.
We will not and cannot forget our heroes who laid down their lives for the homeland we have today and in which there must be no more room for uncertainty and repetition of the sufferings we went through.
It is up to us and the generations to come to preserve the truth about their righteous struggle and not to allow that truth to ever be endangered by deliberate distortion of facts.
Dear attendees,
The intention of the perpetrators of genocide and the joint criminal enterprise was to destroy the multi-ethnic fabric of our society through mass slaughter, torture, rape, expulsion and robbery. Their followers still dream of ending the political project that brought bloodshed to the entire region.
We witness almost daily threats to secede a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina or abuse of the Dayton constitution with various blockades, in order to force us to agree to a policy of division, exclusivity and inequality for all citizens.
We are witnessing the increasingly open support of our neighbors for such policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, their lobbying and pressure in the institutions of the European Union in order to comply with such policies. We will not give in to such demands.
Those who want better relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to face the truth, prevent the questioning of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, stop insulting the victims and those who survived the genocide and the joint criminal enterprise, as well as denying the facts confirmed by the courts.
You cannot deny genocide, provide shelter to war criminals, arrest defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, reward Hague convicts and then declaratively demand better relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
You cannot bypass the official highest institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina by visiting parts of another entity or only cantons with a majority of one nation. That's not how friendships are made with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I wish to emphasize this in particular:
Every part of Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs equally to all citizens. To those who think differently, who seek to maintain and deepen divisions in our society under the guise of legitimacy, I am telling them from this place: you will not achieve it. No one wants such a Bosnia and Herzegovina anymore. The majority of our citizens want a modern, democratic, European state where everyone will have the same rights. Neither does the European Union. The messages of European officials are clear and unequivocal and reject the politics of division and ethnic exclusivity.
Dear attendees,
Regardless of everything, the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be stopped any longer. The vast majority of our citizens want peace, stability and prosperity, they want to build a common and safe future for themselves and their children.
Time is on the side of those who want a stable Bosnia and Herzegovina, who work for its progress and who want to see it safe and prosperous as a member of the European Union and NATO. And we will make it happen. There is no longer any doubt about that.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will gradually return to what it has always been - a place where people of different religions, cultures and identities live together in security and progress. But with a bitter experience in which there will be no more room for forgetting and tragic mistakes that lead to some new genocide or joint criminal enterprise. Be sure of that.
Thank you."
94786,"Address by Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Šefik Džaferović, at the Summit of the Crimea Platform",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=94786&langTag=en-US,2022-08-24,"""Dear President Zelensky, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your invitation and the opportunity to speak at this event.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy towards international partners, which includes friendly Ukraine, is based on openness and equality, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the principle of peaceful cooperation, respect for international law and respect for mutual interests, which is expressly stated in the Foreign Policy Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is fully in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
On 6th of March, 2014, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a special statement on the situation in Ukraine. With that statement, the Presidency expressed its expectation that the newly emerging crisis will be resolved through peaceful and democratic means, dialogue and political negotiations between all relevant parties, with the constructive support of the entire international community, based on globally accepted principles of international law.
On that occasion, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina also expressed its full support for the efforts aimed at overcoming the current situation and maintaining peace and the necessary security, and called on all parties to the dispute to refrain from the use of force and urgently start a political dialogue for a solution to the emerging situation, in the interest of peace , regional and global stability.
One year after the holding of the illegal and illegitimate referendum, and the consequent illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation on 16th of March, 2015 Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the declaration of the high representative on behalf of the EU on Crimea, which confirmed the firm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The same declaration continued with the condemnation of that act of violation of international law, and it was pointed out that the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol is a direct challenge to international security, with serious implications on the international legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states.
Also, the commitment to the full implementation of the non-recognition policy, including restrictive measures, was highlighted. Deep concern was reaffirmed over the continued military build-up and deterioration of the human rights situation in the Crimean Peninsula, including the denial of freedom of speech and the persecution of minorities.
The call was repeated to allow international actors in the field of human rights full, free and unrestricted access to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and Sevastopol.
I repeat, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined this declaration of the high representative on behalf of the European Union on Crimea.
After the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine on 24th of February, 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina, following the aforementioned, joined numerous international documents, such as:
the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations ""Aggression against Ukraine"";
the decision of the Council of Europe on the suspension of the representative office of the Russian Federation from the Council of Europe;
declaration of the high representative on behalf of the European Union on the invasion of the armed forces of the Russian Federation on Ukraine and a series of accompanying declarations, as well as a series of decisions of other international institutions and organizations;
The previously stated positions of Bosnia and Herzegovina were adopted following the decisions of institutions, as well as the international obligations, including the Agreement on Stabilization and Association of BiH with the European Union and other acts.
In the end, despite external and internal pressures, as the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I can say that the stated official positions of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina on support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and on the condemnation of actions that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine have not changed.
Thank you for your attention""."

I remember this unit from the war, from the moments that were great for Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the moments when the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina set out to liberate its territory. What I saw and witnessed when it comes to you is something that is worthy of great respect. In the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, each unit was important in its own way and each had its own role, and there were also units such as the Independent Sokolac Battalion, such as the Ilijaš Brigade, which were units composed of people who were expelled from their homes.
What I had the opportunity to see, and I do not wish to offend anyone, was that those units were often orphan-like, but it seems to me that the more they were treated with injustice, the bigger and braver they were, and that is the size of this battalion.
The moment when we met here on the Nišići plateau and when the First Sokolac Battalion came to our zone of responsibility, what I saw when it comes to a battle is worth it for anyone who is honest to oneself and with others to say: kudos people and thank you for being the way you are!
I want to thank you for telling people who you are, what you are, and what you've been like. This place is not cherished just because we can gather and have a chat, this place is cherished because we can remember those who gave their lives for Bosnia and Herzegovina and to thank them. To thank their families and mothers for giving birth to such sons and daughters, and it is up to us to educate our children as much as we can about the value of our fight in that period.
You are the people who did right, and have held your head high. In fact, you are the people who, together with others from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Police Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, saved this country. It is because of your bravery and sacrifice that we walk freely in our country today. It may not be the country we had envisaged, but, whatever its structure, it is still ours. We can proudly say that we did the right thing for our families and for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and for our homeland.
We did not give up when it was more difficult than it is today. Therefore, this is an opportunity to say that we will never surrender and that we will never give up the fight for this country."""

It is a particular honor to be at Kovači today. Freedom, honor, pride and homeland are the most important words here. White shaheed's nishaans (tombstones) are the clearest testimony of our fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina, freedom and dignity.
When, in the first post-war days, answers and explanations were sought as to how we managed to defend the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our president and commander-in-chief, the late Alija Izetbegović, said: ""When the miracle of the Bosnian resistance is unraveled from some historical distance, it will be found that the secret was somewhere in the souls or character of people"".
Our heroic resistance rests on the sacrifice of those who were ready to stand up against evil and injustice at the cost of their lives and oppose the far superior force of the aggressor. Only such determination, the determination of people who defend the right to survival and citizens who defend the right to freedom and equality, can bear fruit. Such resistance cannot be broken.
Dear attendees,
on this day, we remember one of the most important battles for the defence of Sarajevo and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the battle of Igman. It is one of the greatest military victories won by the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also by our policy, led by the Wartime Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Commander-in-Chief Alija Izetbegović, which were based on just goals and civilizational achievements.
We were attacked from all sides on Igman. The aggressor was convinced that crushing our resistance was only a matter of time. The soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina offered unexpected resistance. Despite all expectations and military logic, that resistance continued to grow stronger after the victory at Igman. The army then grew into a superior and victorious military force.
I want to emphasize this in particular: That victory was not only a military one, but also a civilizational one. We chose democracy. We defended the idea and the being of this country. And that is enormous.
Respected warriors of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
all peoples who turned their struggle into a healthy and functional state, built it on the heritage of values won by people like you. Sometimes it seems that in the arduous political everyday life, in the difficult political efforts we undertake, under the force of obligations and pressures to which we are exposed, we forget how expensive every piece of Bosnia and Herzegovina that you defended was.
But we will not get tired, rest assured, we will not agree to forget. Because of every hero of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that we lost. For every innocent victim that has fallen.
With the depth of the tragedy that happened to us, we can measure our obligation to future generations, with the goal of preserving peace and never letting evil repeat itself again.
Dear attendees,
unfortunately, there are still those who openly attack the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, question its sustainability, threaten divisions, undermine its institutions and international subjectivity, try to undo the progress that we have painstakingly achieved through joint efforts.
The ideological and political followers of those who were the main organizers of the genocide and the joint criminal enterprise, hinder our progress towards achieving full stability, prosperity and membership in the European Union and NATO.
But it seems that the end of these destructions is getting closer. No one wants to open new wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina. All significant international factors are decisively opposed to such a policy. Our persistent action and pointing out the perniciousness of such policies, at home and abroad, has helped spark the new resolve we are witnessing. The ideological and political followers of the organizers of the genocide and the joint criminal enterprise are slowly being left alone.
During my mandate, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I clearly warned and called on international officials to stop such actions and pointed out its disastrous impact on positive processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Amendments to the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prohibit the denial of genocide and other war crimes and the glorification of war criminals, confirm that the international community has finally seen this.
Dear attendees,
Allow me to conclude by underlining the following: It is our duty to complete the construction of the nation for which the best among us have given their lives. Let's forget about ideological divisions, party or personal interests, because the interest of the state is above all these individual interests.
We will succeed only if we create an environment in which young people will continue to live with dignity of their work and start families, because that is the only guarantee of the future. We have to keep that in mind every day and work dedicatedly towards that goal.
Thank you."

Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Šefik Džaferović, at the commemoration ""Remembering Srebrenica"", London.
Honorable representatives of Her Royal Majesty's Parliament and Government, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I thank Mr. Waqar Azmi and ""Remembering Srebrenica"" for organizing this gathering, as well as the United Kingdom for supporting this commemoration program. Thank you to everyone who contributes to preserving the memory of the genocide.
The genocide in Srebrenica is the biggest crime on European soil after World War II. In less than seven days, after July 11, 1995, units of the Republika Srpska Army and Police killed more than eight thousand Bosniak men and boys. The executions were carried out in the manner of Einsatzgruppen squads: the victims were taken out in small groups of five to ten people, blindfolded, shot in the back or the back of the head, and then buried in mass graves.
After the authorities of the United States of America, in the summer of 1995, published satellite images of mass graves, the authorities of Republika Srpska launched an operation to move mass graves from primary locations to secondary and tertiary locations in order to cover up the crimes. This led to the fact that the remains were buried in two, and often in three different mass graves, which are tens of kilometers apart.
This crime represents one of the darkest pages in the history of the 20th century, among other things, because it was committed in the presence of United Nations military forces. The passivity of the United Nations in Srebrenica was only the culmination of their passive and neutral attitude during more than three years of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 1992 to 1995.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The lessons of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and especially the mistakes of the United Nations in Srebrenica, must be an eternal guide for the international community, especially today, when we are witnessing the aggression against Ukraine, followed by a criminal campaign.
One of the reasons that led to the genocide in Srebrenica was the unjust introduction of an embargo on the import of weapons, which deprived Bosnia and Herzegovina of the right to self-defense, guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations, at the very beginning of the war in 1992. We were exposed to the brutal aggression of neighboring Serbia, which inherited all the weapons of the Yugoslav People's Army, and by committing systematic and mass crimes, tried to change the demographic picture of a large part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to annex it and incorporate it into the so-called ""great Serbia"".
Another tendency that led to the genocide was the neutral and relativizing attitude of some international officials, primarily United Nations officials such as Boutros Ghali and Yasushi Akashi, who constantly relativized the crimes committed, equated victims and criminals, and opposed the intervention of international forces.
Some of the rare voices of common sense in those dark years were former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Lord Paddy Ashdown, to whom I would like to give recognition and respect on this occasion, because they recognized from the very beginning who was the victim and who was the aggressor, and demanded the action of the international community in order for crimes to be stopped. Later developments confirmed the correctness of their views.
Today, when Ukraine is faced with the aggression of a neighboring country and when crimes are committed against the civilian population in Ukraine, the lessons from Bosnia and Herzegovina have never been more important. Instead of an embargo, the attacked state must be allowed to defend itself, and the international public must not be allowed to find justifications for aggression and crimes. There must be a clear distinction between criminals and victims, because anything else leads us to darkness and the moral collapse of humanity.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am grateful to the authorities of the United Kingdom for their contribution to the intervention of the NATO alliance, which stopped the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and concluded the Dayton Peace Agreement.
I am also grateful for the support that the United Kingdom has given in the past 27 years of the implementation of the peace agreement, primarily when it comes to the integration path of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the strengthening of state institutions. In this sense, we owe special thanks to the late Lord Paddy Ashdown, who served as a high representative of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lord Ashdown will remain forever in the memory of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an unwavering fighter for justice, and the time of his mandate will be remembered as a golden age of reforms, strengthening the state and prosecution of war criminals. With his activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lord Ashdown continued the brightest British tradition of fighting for freedom and against tyranny
Of special importance, in the context of preserving the memory of the genocide, was his decision from 2003, by which the building of the former battery factory in Potočari was handed over to the Memorial Center, which laid the material basis for the formation of the Memorial Center as a state institution in charge of preserving the memory of the genocide in Srebrenica.
I am grateful to the Parliament and the current government of the United Kingdom for their decisive action over the past year, when it comes to suppressing the crisis caused by the secessionist actions of the authorities of Republika Srpska entity. It was thanks to the sanctions imposed by the British authorities on the officials of Republika Srpska, as well as the support that the British government, together with the rest of the Euro-Atlantic community, gave to the High Representative Christian Schmidt in applying the Bonn powers, that the situation stabilized.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The fight for the protection of the victims of the genocide in Srebrenica is not something that only concerns Bosniaks. This really primarily concerns Bosniaks, because the genocide in Srebrenica was a crime against Bosniaks. But punishing the genocide in Srebrenica also concerns the overall international security. We have seen from the example of the shootings in the Syrian Tadamon or the Ukrainian Bucha that crimes are not a thing of the past. We also saw it in the example of the attacks in Norway's Utoya and New Zealand's Christchurch
The outcome of the fight for justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina is monitored not only by civilized people in the world, but also by villains. Whether the crime will be punished or rewarded is something they are also interested in. That is why the fight for justice in Srebrenica is a fight for justice on the whole globe and beyond. That is why the fight for the safety and future of Srebrenica children is a fight for the safety and future of every child.
Thank you for your attention."

Unfortunately, the occasion is sad and today we remember the thousands of men and boys who were brutally murdered in Srebrenica 27 years ago. We remember the interrupted youth, hope, we remember the interrupted dreams.
Remembrance of all that happened is necessary for the sake of the whole world, to which, unfortunately, it was not enough that what we went through on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I say, it was not enough because we are still witnessing the forces of evil that reign around us and the suffering of the innocent. After the genocide in Srebrenica, nothing is the same, and our fight for justice and truth is still ongoing. And it will continue until the politicians and individuals who deny what they did, while belittling the innocent victims and their families, go to the dustbin of history.
All of us, who are witnesses to our painful past, have a duty for the sake of new generations and their future not to forget and not to allow such evil to ever happen again.
On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, the Italian Prime Minister said that what happened in Srebrenica was a defeat of our common values. I wish to remind of that important message, which was delivered on behalf of the state and citizens of Italy, especially because, unfortunately, we are still witnessing crimes and violations of basic human rights and international law in Ukraine, which is exposed to Russian aggression.
Europe and humanity must finally learn from the genocide in Srebrenica so that the violence, which innocent people are again exposed to today, can be stopped.
We are reminded of crimes in vain if new crimes are happening before our eyes, and that is why we must all unite in defense of common values, and peace and tolerance among people are the basic values on which the European Union itself is founded.
This ""Flower of Srebrenica"" here from Rogno, a memorial that was created thanks to your help, empathy and compassion, will send a loud message to the whole world. It will be a silent reminder of innocence, pain and suffering, but at the same time the hope that not a single person should ever again be a victim of a criminal hand.
On behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who want peace and in my own name, I want to thank you for this expression of respect for the victims of genocide. It is a strong message that the evil committed against one group of people because of their name and origin is evil against the whole of humanity, but at the same time it is also a message that we can resist crime and genocidal intentions only by being united.
It is a pre-requisite for building a better world, based on the values of humanism and cooperation between peoples and countries."
94497,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Šefik Džaferović, at the commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, Potočari, 11 July 2022",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=94497&langTag=en-US,2022-07-12,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, survivors, families of the victims, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
There is no sadder place in the world today than this place right here. Twenty-seven years is enough for the whole world to change, but in one man's life it is not much. At the age of twenty-seven, a man is just entering the mature age, in which he should experience his most important experiences.
Hajrudin Halilović was twenty-seven years old when he was killed in July 1995. In one of the fifty coffins, which we will lay in the cold Potočari soil, there are also his remains. Hajrudin was killed together with his father Alaga. Until the beginning of the war, they lived in the village of Osat, and they came to Srebrenica, like others, because they thought they would find salvation there, after it was declared a ""protected zone by the United Nations"".
Of Hajrudin, only ""right hand, right leg, other arm, some parts of his jaw and very little of his chest bones"" were found. He and his father were captured on the fateful July 11 here, in Potočari, in the presence of United Nations military forces, and after that, like thousands of others, they were taken to the vicinity of Zvornik, where they were shot and buried in mass graves.
Twenty-seven years is not much time, but it is an eternity for the families of Hajrudin Halilović and other victims, who spent all those years waiting for the bodies of their loved ones to be found and at least buried. Unfortunately, numerous families still have not found their fathers and sons, brothers and cousins. Hundreds of mothers died before finding even a single bone of their children, which testifies the monstrosity of the crime committed here.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The mass executions committed in July 1995 were not the result of some spontaneous and uncontrolled hatred. On the contrary, the genocide in Srebrenica was a consciously and carefully planned crime, with political motives. It was, namely, the final act of ""establishing a corridor in the Drina valley and eliminating the Drina as a border"", which Radovan Karadzic had already in May 1992, at the Assembly of Bosnian Serbs, determined as one of the six strategic goals of the war.
The Srebrenica genocide is neither a temporally nor a spatially isolated crime. The men and boys who were captured after the fall of the enclave, in July 1995, were Bosniaks from Podrinje - from Srebrenica, but also from Zvornik, Vlasenica, Bratunac, Višegrad, Rogatica, Han Pijeska and Milići, from where they fled in 1992 before the first wave of crimes and flowed into the ""UN protected zone"".
After being captured in Potočari and the surrounding forests, they were mostly not killed here, on the spot, but in a well-organized operation they were taken to the broader area of Bratunac and Zvornik, where they were killed, at locations approximately seventy kilometers away from this place. Some were transported as far as Kalinovik or Trnovo, not far from Sarajevo, and were killed there.
The genocide operation was directed by the President of Republika Srpska and the Commander of the General Headquarters of the Army of Republika Srpska. The operation involved the commands and personnel of the Drina Corps, the Zvornik and Bratunac Brigades, then the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Srpska, additional military and police units from Bijeljina, Doboj, Višegrad, and the special police forces of neighboring Serbia, the so-called ""Scorpions"".
In order to kill thousands of people, thousands of people were needed, those who had clear responsibilities and orders. The genocide was not committed by the Serbian people, nor by any alienated unit, but by the institutional structure of the Republika Srpska, supported by Serbia. The authorities of Serbia and the Republika Srpska entity know all this very well, but they will not admit it.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Denial of crime is not an expression of the denialist's inability to learn and accept the truth. Denying a crime, like covering it up, is just a continuation of its commission. It speaks of a perverted continuity.
We must never forget that Ratko Mladić himself, after the fall of Srebrenica, denied that murders were being planned, assuring the captured Bosniaks themselves, as well as representatives of the international community, that all prisoners would be evacuated. He claimed this after, at a meeting at the Fontana Hotel, he had already given orders to kill all the prisoners. From the beginning to the end of the operation, he denied that the murders were taking place, although he personally visited the execution sites and supervised them.
When the authorities of the United States of America published satellite images of mass graves, the authorities of the Republika Srpska, in the fall of 1995, launched a huge operation of moving corpses from primary to secondary and tertiary mass graves, in order to cover up the traces of the crime.
Not long after that, the authorities of Republika Srpska formed the so-called the ""mixed commission"", which was supposed to make the first report on the murders of the people of Srebrenica. All the cynicism was reflected in the fact that among the members of the commission was Milorad Trbić, one of the officers of the Zvornik Brigade who organized the executions and relocation of the graves, for which he was later convicted.
In the past years, we have continued to witness the efforts of the Government of Republika Srpska to deny the genocide in Srebrenica, through commission reports and in other ways.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
However, we are attending this commemoration under special conditions. It will soon be a year since the former high representative of the international community, Valentin Inzko, passed the law, after which genocide denial and hate speech based on it almost completely disappeared from the public space.
Mr. Inzko is not here, but I wish to send him a message. Mr. Inzko, thank you for what you have done, because you have not only fulfilled the duty prescribed by your mandate and your conscience, but you have also saved the restoration of trust among the people of this country. History will remember your act as protective towards victims and justice, but also one that protects the peace, because it was your law that stopped the swelling wave of negationism, which retrograde politicians used to poison relations between nations and undermine sensitively built peace.
Thanks also to the member states of the PIC for the support they have given to this law. The experience with the adoption and implementation of this law has shown that more justice means more peace and more hope for a better future. This should be a lesson for the future activities of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In two days, the mothers of Srebrenica will visit the places of mass murders: Kravica, Orahovac, Petkovce, Branjevo, Kozluk and Pilica. In these small towns, the largest mass murders on the European continent took place after the Second World War. But at none of these execution sites, there is not even a letter about what happened. The local authorities of Zvornik and Bratunac are preventing the installation of signs, because they want to hide the truth.
In the past, the local authorities of these municipalities, through the engagement of their civil protection and utility companies, helped to hide the traces of crimes, and now they do so through the banning of placing signs or renovating a building in Kravica.
If local authorities continue to blatantly prevent the commemoration of the genocide, then, Mr Schmidt, you must do what the late Paddy Ashdown did in 2003 when, as High Representative, he dedicated this building to the Memorial Centre. The warehouse in Kravica and the House of Culture in Pilica, as the places where the genocide was committed, cannot be anything but the genocide monuments. I call on the local authorities to respect the victims and the pain of their families.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This year, for the first time, the Srebrenica Inferno will be performed by a choir of children from Srebrenica. The terribly sad verses will be even sadder this year, because they are performed by the descendants of the murdered. At the same time, they will also give us hope, because these children are proof that, despite the crime in which entire lineages and surnames were exterminated, Bosniaks survived in Podrinje.
It is the duty of all of us to insist on truth and justice. The obligation of all of us is to do everything necessary for the new generations in Srebrenica, so that they can live and work here. Each of us has to think throughout the year how it is for the Bosniaks in Srebrenica; each of us must come and visit the returnees, help the economic perspective, especially young people. Because the fight against genocidal intent will be successful only if young people decide to stay and live here.
Thank you."

It is a special honour for me to be with you today, at the opening of the Global Baku Forum, which this year is entitled ""Challenges to the Global Order"". I thank the Nizami Ganjavi International Centre for the invitation and warm hospitality in Baku.
President Aliyev, I wish you success in the reconstruction and rebuilding of Karabakh, success in the implementation of the post-World War II agreement and success in protecting the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan in accordance with international law, as you yourself have said.
What are the challenges to the global world order? To answer this question, we must consider our behaviour in global world crises, such as migration, pandemic, aggression against Ukraine. We all bear the consequences of global crises, although we are not all equally responsible for them.
What can be done to prevent crises or to avoid or mitigate the harmful consequences?
The answer is logical and simple, but, unfortunately, because of the world as it is today, it is difficult to achieve. We all know that the answer lies in greater justice, unity, solidarity, international law, strong and effective multilateral mechanisms. However, we do not seem to be able to achieve that. We say never again after every crisis, and yet the crises keep happening, and these are the crises a man is responsible for. Therefore, using the authority of the Baku Forum, we must constantly emphasize these things and be persistent in the fight for a better world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this part of the world is similar to the part of the world I come from. Both the Caucasus and the Balkans are crossroads - places where different worlds meet. Often these places, being at the crossroads of the great empires, were the places of conflict. But at the same time they have been the meeting places of civilizations and cultures. It is thanks to these meetings that new paradigms have been created in these places.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is one such paradigm. My country is not one of the great countries of the world, but it is an extremely important country, even in a global context, precisely because of its paradigm.
For centuries, communities belonging to different cultural and civilizational circles have lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Islamic, Roman Catholic and Orthodox, Jewish, etc.
Throughout its history, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been built as a community of diversity, developing special social practices and institutes, unknown to mono-ethnic societies. Knowledge and respect for other people's religious and traditional customs, then cultural syncretism and other practices, have over time become an integral part of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian identity that people in Bosnia and Herzegovina are proud of.
In the last few decades, through globalization, major economic migrations and other processes, something unexpected happened. Multi-ethnicity, which to many seemed like a deviation specific to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans, has become a feature of developed modern societies. It is now quite normal for people of all races and many cultures to live in one society. The whole world has become a crossroads.
It is no longer a question - whether our societies can and should be multi-ethnic, because they already are. The only question is how to organize life in them, for the benefit of all their members. What is applicable to a society anywhere in the world, is applicable for the world as a whole, as a global society.
Dear friends,
the global order, as we have known it for decades, was founded after the end of World War II, as a counterbalance to the Nazi project aimed at destroying multi-ethnic societies, eradicating or enslaving entire nations, and regulating international relations on the principle of force and domination.
Awareness that all parts of the world are interdependent, and that regional crises can turn into world fires, has prompted the international community to establish global institutions and a rule-based order. The mission of the United Nations, defined in the founding acts, is to ensure international peace, with dialogue, tolerance and pluralistic awareness.
Today, when, after the experiences of the pandemic and aggression against Ukraine, we talk about the challenges to the global order, we state the impossibility of multilateral institutions to respond to the challenges of the era. We are witnessing a violation of international law.
What we should not forget is that this process has not started now. The greatest collapse, after the Second World War, the United Nations experienced in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the period from 1992 to 1995.
For the first time since the founding of the UN, a war was launched on European soil aimed at forcibly seizing part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and exterminating the Bosniak people, as a community that was to be protected by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.
At the very start of the war, the United Nations Security Council imposed an unjust embargo on arms imports to Bosnia and Herzegovina, preventing us from exercising our right to self-defense under the Charter of the United Nations.
At the same time, the United Nations failed to protect Bosnia and Herzegovina, its member, which was subjected to brutal aggression from its neighbourhood.
The fact that for more than three and a half years, mass crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina were committed in the presence of the United Nations military force, UNPROFOR, has ruined the credibility of this world's largest organization. Finally, in July 1995, despite the presence of UNPROFOR, the genocide was committed in Srebrenica, the largest massacre on European soil since World War II, in which more than 8,000 people were killed in just a few days.
The fact that the institutions of the international order, primarily the Security Council, had the opportunity to prevent the genocide in Srebrenica, but did not do so, due to indecision, left lasting consequences on the credibility of the UN.
I see the biggest defeat of the United Nations today in the fact that none of them even expects to stop the aggression against Ukraine and crimes against the civilian population. The adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution condemning the aggression against Ukraine is a significant act, but if it exhausts the possibilities of the UN, then there is no doubt that the system must be reformed. International peace and the inviolability of the borders of sovereign states cannot be held hostage by the vetoes of privileged states.
Dear friends,
in anticipation of the reform of the United Nations system, as a long-term and comprehensive solution, we must also think of current solutions. In this regard, I will refer again to the experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was signed after NATO intervention, based on a Security Council resolution, and was implemented thanks to the presence of NATO troops and the international civilian community, primarily through the Office of High Representative as an institution which was given the right to annul acts contrary to the Dayton Agreement and to sanction officials who violate this agreement.
During the 27 years of implementation of the Dayton Agreement, High Representative acts with the support of the Peace Implementation Council, which elects him, and reports to the Security Council, fulfilling the obligations of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on International Peacekeeping Actions.
The effectiveness of the international community in BiH has been demonstrated in recent months, when the Republika Srpska entity launched a series of secessionist activities, seeking to overthrow state institutions required by the Constitution to preserve sovereignty and territorial integrity, such as a unified armed forces, judiciary, tax system and others.
Members of the Peace Implementation Council imposed sanctions on those responsible for secessionist activities, and High Representative used his powers to repeal acts contrary to the Dayton Accords, making a crucial contribution to stabilizing the situation.
Thanks to multilateral action and the action of the international community system, the worst-case scenario was prevented - the spillover of war from Ukraine to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but to ensure long-term stability we will need much more caution, wisdom and, above all, determination.
Dear friends,
I spoke about the challenges to the global order mainly through the example of my country, because the example of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly shows that when multilateral mechanisms fulfil their mission, things move forward and peace can be protected.
Thank you for your attention."
94182,"Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović at the South East European Cooperation Process Summit, 10th of June 2022",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=94182&langTag=en-US,2022-06-10,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to see you again, a year after the last summit in Antalya. I wish to thank Prime Minister Mitsotakis for the cordial hospitality and organization of the Summit.
We have often heard, at similar gatherings in recent years, that the world is changing rapidly, and these changes have been elucidated in detail. Today, after the pandemic and the aggression against Ukraine, it has become more than obvious that the world is no longer the same. The entire security architecture of the European continent has changed.
At this moment, it is of the utmost importance to help Ukraine defend itself from aggression. The lesson we need to know is that peace will be increasingly closer, as the aggressor becomes more aware that with time, the aggressor will have to pay the higher price.
Unlike Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had an unfair embargo on arms imports imposed during the 1992-1995 aggression, Ukraine was provided with timely defense weapons. This shows that, although history repeats itself, the international community has leart some lessons. The most important thing is to preserve European and Euro-Atlantic unity. Were it not for that unity and support for Ukraine, the question would be where would the aggression have ended.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the war in Ukraine has not yet spread to other countries, but its implications are enormous. This can be seen in the Western Balkans, and we in Bosnia and Herzegovina are feeling the consequences.
For more than a year now, a severe political crisis has been going on in my country, which has intensified especially just before and after the aggression against Ukraine.
It is no secret that there are actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina who are under the Russian influence. It was they who, through their actions, called into question the Dayton Agreement and 27 years of its implementation, threatening secession and taking concrete anti-constitutional steps leading towards that goal. This seems to be a threat to the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which our Constitution defines as necessary to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as the unified Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the tax system, judiciary and others.
Thanks to the support of the international community, led by the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, we are managing to keep things under control, even though the situation is still very fragile. It is essential that the international community re-strengthen the mechanisms established in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which calls for international action to preserve peace. I am thinking primarily of the Office of the High Representative and the international military mission - EUFOR.
The High Representative, in fulfilling his obligations under the Dayton Accords and using the powers deriving from that agreement, has annulled some secessionist moves by the government of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian entity of Republika Srpska, which threaten the constitutional order and peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the same time, the High Representative thwarted the attempt of some ministers, who, abusing the right of ethnic veto, tried to suspend democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, making the elections conditional on changes to the Election Law.
The Dayton Peace Accords aimed to stop the war. That is why the system it established remained unfinished. Opportunities for blockades and abuses remain, especially when it comes to using ethnic and entity vetoes.
Simply put, national actors have been given the opportunity to block almost every decision and paralyze the entire system with impunity. The only instance that could sanction them and unblock the system is the Office of the High Representative, which is why it had been formed.
We need to build national accountability mechanisms and complete the system, so that we could function without Office of High Representative (OHR). Our goal is not for the OHR to remain forever, but to complete the construction of a functional system, so that, even when the OHR leaves one day, the state can function independently. Until then, we will need international supervision, just as it was extremely useful in the form of Allied control councils to other countries, such as Germany and Austria, after the Second World War. Thanks to that supervision and international support, and not in spite of it, these countries have become among the most organized countries in Europe.
Dear friends,
Bosnia and Herzegovina's strategic goals are membership in the European Union and NATO. We have made remarkable progress since the Stability Pact held in Sarajevo in 1999, when the countries of South East Europe were promised a Euro-Atlantic perspective, and through the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, when the European Union opened its doors. We have implemented a number of reforms and significantly improved relations in the region.
It is clear to us that there are a number of problems within the EU that have resulted in fears of enlargement. But we should never forget that the European Union, despite all the difficulties, became stronger, better and safer with the addition of new members than it would have been without them. I have no dilemma that this would be the case with the inclusion of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries in this part of Europe.
That is why I expect that Bosnia and Herzegovina's European path will be strongly supported and furthered at the upcoming European Union-Western Balkans Summit this month.
I support the initiative presented here by President Pahor to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status. This would repay the debt to Bosnia and Herzegovina by the international community.
In 2004, Bosnia and Herzegovina was shoulder to shoulder with Croatia on the EU path, but due to the failure of the international community to meet the obligations foresighted by the Dayton Agreement, it eventually lost pace.
I also expect that at the next NATO summit, the NATO integration path of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be strongly supported and improved.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports regional cooperation. We want to build good relations with our neighbours, resolve open questions through dialogue, and if that is not possible, then through the institutions of international law.
We have confirmed our commitment to regional cooperation by joining the Common Regional Market, within the Berlin Process. We are extremely interested in the implementation of this initiative, in cooperation with the EU, in order to enable our citizens to consume the four basic freedoms of movement (people, goods, services and capital) throughout the Western Balkans. That is why I am extremely pleased that the resolution of this summit supports the Berlin Process as well as the Common Regional Market.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a credible partner for regional cooperation, and we want to make a strong contribution to these processes in order to ensure a peaceful, stable and prosperous future for our citizens.
Thank you for your attention."
93989,"Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović at the meeting with ambassadors of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels, 25th of May 2022",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93989&langTag=en-US,2022-06-06,"Dear ambassadors of the member states, and NATO Deputy Secretary General! It is a great honour and pleasure for me to address this esteemed body of the North Atlantic Alliance and acquaint you with the situation in my country.
In the past few years, and especially the last one, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been experiencing a deep crisis, which has called into question 27 years of painstakingly built peace. Irresponsible actors within Bosnia and Herzegovina, motivated by malignant influence from abroad, set out to unilaterally violate the Dayton Peace Agreement and 27 years of results of its implementation. The sense of security of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been seriously undermined.
The situation in my country has further complicated the consequences of the Russian aggression on Ukraine and the disruption of the overall security architecture that has been the foundation of European security for decades. The horror scenes we are witnessing in Ukraine these days remind us of the bloody scenes that came from Bosnia and Herzegovina, before the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
The fact that the Dayton Agreement, as a cornerstone of security in the Balkans and overall European security, has been called into question deserves the full attention of this esteemed body.
Dear ambassadors and NATO Deputy Secretary General,
NATO played a crucial role in ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During more than three and a half years of aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations and the then European Community failed to bring peace and stop crimes.
The passivity and artificial neutrality with which the UN acceded, especially encouraged those who tried to destroy and divide Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the culmination resulted with the genocide in Srebrenica, which was committed in the presence of United Nations military forces.
The essential change came only with the inclusion of NATO, which, with its intervention, did what the United Nations should have done. NATO stopped the war and brutal aggression against an internationally recognized state, and stopped horrific crimes and partially punished their perpetrators. Although the intervention came with a delay, thanks to it, the hope survived that there is still a civilization and the belief that the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide are not meaningless.
The conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement ensured long-term peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which until then had looked impossible. Thanks to the decision of the North Atlantic Council, and based on the provisions of the Dayton Agreement and the Security Council resolution, the presence of NATO military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, within the international peacekeeping missions IFOR and SFOR, was enabled.
In the most critical period of the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, from 1996 to 2004, NATO military forces made a crucial contribution to maintaining peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was one of the most successful international military missions in recent history. No attacks were reported on members of the international force, who successfully overcame all security challenges and provided the civilian authorities with the necessary conditions to implement the Dayton Accords.
Dear ambassadors and NATO Deputy Secretary General,
thanks to the support of the international community, as well as our national efforts, we have made significant progress in the past 27 years of implementing the Dayton Accords.
The clear provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement and the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina provide the possibility for the state to establish additional state institutions and take over the competencies it needs to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Implementing this provision, as well as realizing the obligations from our EU and NATO path, we have established one army, intelligence service, judiciary, tax system and numerous other institutions, which are necessary for preserving sovereignty and territorial integrity. Thanks to these institutions, Bosnia and Herzegovina has increasingly become able to function independently.
Thanks to the strengthening of Bosnia and Herzegovina's state institutions, things have progressed to such an extent that peace and stability could be preserved, even after the initial 60,000 international troops were reduced to just 600, which was unthinkable after the end of the war when the three warring sides were still very wary of each other.
Unfortunately, in the past ten months, we have witnessed a brutal attack on these state institutions. Authorities in the Republika Srpska entity, an administrative unit within Bosnia and Herzegovina established by the Dayton Peace Accords, have threatened to unilaterally disband state institutions.
Threats of secession, as well as an attempt by the authorities of the lower administrative unit to take over the powers of the state needed to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity, are an open attack on the constitutional order.
Considering NATO's role in concluding and implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement, as well as its overall mandate when it comes to protecting European security, let me warn this esteemed body of the dangers of these secessionist activities, which threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and undermine European security.
Dear ambassadors and NATO Deputy Secretary General,
Bosnia and Herzegovina should not go backwards, through the annulment of 27 years of progress. We need to turn to the future, reforms and economic development, with full respect for the constitutional and legal system, which we have created through the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. Bosnia and Herzegovina should continue its path towards the European Union and NATO, in accordance with the assumed international obligations and decisions of its institutions.
When we talk about the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we often hear calls for internal dialogue and consensus. The problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not the lack of dialogue and consensus at all. The problem is that the actors from the Republika Srpska entity do not adhere to the existing solutions that we came to precisely through painstaking dialogue and consensus.
The best such example is the NATO path of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a country, we paved our NATO path many years ago. With the consent of everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including representatives from the Republika Srpska entity, we adopted the Law on Defence in the Parliamentary Assembly, which clearly states that the goal of Bosnia and Herzegovina is membership in the NATO Alliance.
Thereafter, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on consensus, submitted an application for membership in NATO, which provided Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Membership Action Plan (MAP).
When, acting on these decisions, the NATO Secretary General requested from Bosnia and Herzegovina to submit the first Annual National Program in December 2018, based on the obligations arising from the MAP, there was a problem because the Republika Srpska representatives, contrary to the laws and the decisions made, said that everything we had achieved was no longer valid.
After a year of painstaking efforts, we finally managed to resolve this by submitting a Reform Program to NATO. Two years later, the Republika Srpska entity representatives in the Council of Ministers are obstructing the adoption and submission of a new cycle of reform programs, slowing Bosnia and Herzegovina's compliance with the NATO's commitments.
Personally, I believe that the Republika Srpska representatives did not independently deviate from the realization of the agreement, but did so at the request of the Russian Federation, which openly expressed interest in stopping our NATO path. It is obvious that the blockade of institutions and the lack of realization of adopted decisions has become a means of blocking NATO's path.
In any case, we cannot talk about dialogue and consensus, if the authorities of the RS entity obstruct what came about as a result of dialogue and consensus, whether it is the Reform Program, the BiH Armed Forces or something else. The basic precondition for a dialogue and consensus is that the established solutions are respected.
I therefore call on this esteemed body to insist on the actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region to respect the achieved solutions and hold accountable all those who unilaterally deviate from them. This will best protect the Dayton Agreement, stability within Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the degree of integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into NATO.
I call on the Allies to send strong signals and support furthering of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s NATO path at the upcoming Strategic Concept part of the NATO Summit in Madrid, in order to send a clear message to those who want to stop this process.
In recent times, we have been hearing messages from NATO that, in addition to protecting its members, it will also provide support to aspiring countries in response to the widening of aggression against Ukraine. We thank you for that, but we believe that it is not enough when it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the Dayton Peace Agreement, NATO has an obligation to protect the peace, stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which should be clearly stated at the Madrid Summit.
Dear ambassadors and NATO Deputy Secretary General,
Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to join NATO and we support the integration of other aspiring countries. We reject any conditioning of anyone's path with the changes to the Election Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina that we have been recently hearing in the public space.
Reform of the Election Law has been a problem that Bosnia and Herzegovina has been facing since 2009, when the European Court of Human Rights ruled in Sejdić-Finci case and determined that our electoral system needs to be improved. Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently elected according to the system established by the Dayton Peace Agreement. Our obligation is to harmonize the Election Law with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and to ensure the rights of those citizens who do not belong to any of the constituent peoples.
Dear ambassadors and NATO Deputy Secretary General,
given that Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to the complex decision-making system established in Dayton, does not have fully developed own mechanisms for the timely prevention of secessionist activities, we need the support of the international community. Experience with the implementation of the Dayton Agreement shows that such support has always proved useful and effective.
This was shown at the beginning of this year, when we had security incidents in January. Simultaneously, in several cities in the Republika Srpska entity, people who returned to their homes after the war were intimidated. This introduced a sense of insecurity, which culminated after the Russian aggression on Ukraine.
The deployment of additional EUFOR troops has helped increase the sense of security. Given that NATO member states are participating in the EUFOR mission, I take this opportunity to welcome the decision to deploy additional forces, while remaining convinced that it is better to prevent a fire than to extinguish it.
What is most worrying at the moment is that, after the Russian aggression in Ukraine, the extension of EUFOR's mandate in the Security Council has been called into question. This is the result of the joint action of the authorities of the Republika Srpska entity and the Russian Federation, which has recently started discrediting the EUFOR mission, questioning the scope of its executive mandate.
After the possibility of renewing the NATO mission instead of EUFOR was opened, the Republika Srpska government softened their stance on EUFOR, and a few days ago openly supported the EUFOR mission, suggesting that its status should no longer be determined by the international community, but that there should be a new agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU put in place.
There should be no new decisions made with regards to the presence of international military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is a proposal, which carries with it the danger that those who threaten secession, block state institutions and question our NATO path and the Dayton Peace Agreement would play a decisive role in the duration and scope of EUFOR's mandate. In order to implement the military aspects of the Dayton Agreement, EUFOR forces must not be politically dependent on these political actors.
I believe that the EUFOR mandate will not be challenged in the Security Council in November this year. Should any of the permanent members of the Security Council veto it, I would like to make it clear that the international military force nevertheless has the right and obligation to continue its mandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the Dayton Peace Agreement and other acts earlier institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina had agreed to the presence of an international military mission.
Bearing in mind that, in addition to EUFOR, NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo is the legal successor to the original missions, I call on the North Atlantic Council to contribute to ensuring the smooth continuation of the military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with its obligations under Annex 1 of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Thank you for your attention."
93953,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović at the main event in Sarajevo marking the 30th anniversary of the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the United Nations,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93953&langTag=en-US,2022-05-23,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Resident Coordinator Macdonald, Your excellences! It is a great pleasure to address you on the occasion of this important jubilee. On this day, 30 years ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the United Nations. The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina was raised in front of the East River building, along with the flags of Slovenia and Croatia.
That was one of the most significant moments in our history, it was solemn, but we did not celebrate. We could not. We were forced to fight for freedom, independence, but also for democracy as we were facing huge sacrifices already.
The international community had accepted the fact that international law is at the foundation of our statehood. Admission to the United Nations was the final stamp on that viewpoint. The highest standards of international law determined the path that had been consistently and transparently met in declaring our independence. Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, almost two-thirds of them, of all ethnicities, showed political maturity, responsibility in the face of history and generations to come and voted for independence on February 29 and March 1, 1992.
The international community accepted this, and the whole world recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, under unimaginably difficult circumstances, ensured that, in addition to individual recognitions, Bosnia and Herzegovina was affirmed at the multilateral and global level. We entered the world stage on May 22, 1992, with the UN Resolution No. 757, and since then our intensive and meaningful relationship with the UN Organization and its agencies has continued. Thirty years of membership deserves a much more detailed and meaningful review, but allow me to iterate the following in the shortest terms.
The international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina and simultaneous admission to the UN was an important and irreversible diplomatic act. The symbolic message of the international community and the UN that it stood with Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence, however, was brutally tested on the ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, but also in international forums where the act of international recognition and admission to the UN would become an important capital of the war-torn state. The UN membership was of key significance. There are only a few countries in the world that have had such a historic disaster as Bosnia and Herzegovina that their mere survival depended on the UN, and to be among those who experienced the consequences of the inefficiency of the UN system on the ground.
Although the UN has had many successes and failures in peacekeeping operations during its existence, only the tragic scale of crimes and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also in Rwanda, would affect changes in the institutional culture of ""peacekeeping"" developed by the UN Secretariat and which had not recognized the possibility of humanitarian intervention to protect civilians from crimes against humanity.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a specific international context, can be described as a victim of the passivity of the international community, but by no means only as an object but a state that has shown exceptional, even unprecedented intensity of diplomatic activity. We have failed to reform the UN, or to change the post-Cold War state of relations in the international community, and, unfortunately, this is a process that still remains to be completed.
However, even the subtle changes in the course of this cumbersome global mechanism, reflected in the consideration and introduction of new concepts of protection of civilians in war conflicts, international punishment of crimes and, in particular, sexual crimes against women, can be considered significant global diplomatic successes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Countries with much greater foreign policy capacity would have found it difficult to accomplish such changes.
Allow me also to point out the fact that each of the 55 UNSC resolutions from this period, which refer to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the situation in the former Yugoslavia, was very clear and precise in terms of describing the situation and events on the ground. This would prove extremely important for determining the character of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which at that time was interpreted differencly.
The diplomatic mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the UN was, of course, among the first and most important diplomatic missions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, let me highlight, the contribution of the mission had in the formation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The Hague tribunal and its attitude towards it, even after its formal closure in November 2017, remained a measure of political decency and emancipation from the aggressive nationalism of the 1990s for all countries of the former Yugoslavia. Based on that experience, Bosnia and Herzegovina was an active participant in the establishment of the International Criminal Court.
Global visibility and experience gained by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s would prove to be a very important political and diplomatic resource even in years when Bosnia and Herzegovina was no longer high on the agenda of international issues, and when faced with a different position in the UN - the one all other countries enjoy, and whereby, given the size and capacity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is very difficult to be noticed.
Although the intensity of diplomatic activities has been reduced to a regular, peacetime level, Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained, for a country of its size and foreign policy capacity, a very visible, committed and active member of the United Nations. One part of these activities is still related to cooperation with the UN and UN agencies in the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, and the impact and shaping of the UN engagement, because Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained, to this day, one of the topics at UN Security Council meetings.
The second part of our diplomatic activities is dedicated to sharing experiences in conflict and post-conflict situations. In the UN environment, I can convey this to you first hand, and the BiH ambassadors present at the UN can confirm this, the fact that is especially appreciated is that in less than ten years since the end of the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina moved from a country which hosted international military forces to the category of a state participating in peacekeeping missions.
Bosnian-Herzegovinian troops were part of peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, Congo and Mali, and police officers in Cyprus, and in Liberia, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Central African Republic. So far, more than 2,000 troops and several hundred police officers have participated in UN peacekeeping missions.
Our engagement in the UN and the attitudes we have promoted have best confirmed that we share the principles and values of the UN Charter.
This was recognized and rewarded with the greatest diplomatic success of BiH - membership in the UN Security Council in the period 2010-2011 as a non-permanent member. It is a source of great pride for Bosnia and Herzegovina that 174 UN members voted FOR its non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
Furthermore, perhaps more importantly, the two-year term in this ""global government"" meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced new foreign policy and diplomatic challenges, to which we, united as rarely we were, successfully responded. The intensity and content of our diplomatic activities confirmed Bosnia and Herzegovina as an equal and competent partner in the international community, and an actor whose diplomatic performance is often well above objective foreign policy capacities. We can also thank our outstanding ambassadors and mission staff for this.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have shown visibility and commitment in many other UN bodies, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, through active and successful cooperation with UN agencies. Our view of the UN is realistic and balanced - we understand and see the difficulties and global challenges facing the UN, but we also recognize the value of these goals and the need for humanity to make this organization a success. That is why we remain committed to these principles and goals and we want to share our experience and offer our full contribution.
Our position in the United Nations is determined by universal trends of intensifying globalization and interdependence, realistic foreign policy capacities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, harmonized foreign policy goals of BiH, sustainable development goals, and high intensity of diplomatic activities of our missions in the United Nations. Therefore, I firmly believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to consistently fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights as a full member of the United Nations.
Finally, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the United Nations, allow me extend my words of gratitude and sincere congratulations to all officials and international officials of the UN and its agencies, international and local staff of the UN and UN agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UN volunteers, as well as Bosnian-Herzegovinian ambassadors and diplomats who, with their professional and personal engagement, have contributed to successful membership in these 30 years.
I invite you to continue working daily with the younger generations to the benefit of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to promote peace, cooperation and sustainable development in the United Nations community.

93392,Address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić on the occasion of marking the 30th anniversary of the formation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Mostar,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93392&langTag=en-US,2022-04-18,"Dear comrades-in-arms, citizens of Mostar, Herzegovina, it is my great pleasure to be here with you today, on the day when we mark the 30th anniversary of the formation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
From this time distance of thirty years, and when we take into account the existing political and security context, we can say with certainty that the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of BiH, is most deserving for the survival of Bosnia and Herzegovina. No one is more deserving than members of the Army of the Republic of BiH and the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of BiH for the fact that the admission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations in May 1992 did not remain a dead letter.
Left by the United Nations at the mercy of the aggressor, members of the Republic of BiH Army, at first, with almost no means to fight and defend the state, made superhuman efforts to preserve their homeland, and they succeeded. There were moments, especially during the difficult 1993, when, due to the double aggression on the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, everything seemed to be lost, but even then we did not give up nor did we lose hope.
The negotiating table was never sat at in circumstances when the forces of the Army of the Republic of BiH were in an unfavourable position, but the opposite. I want to note here that the Washington and Dayton Accords were preceded by the defeats of the aggressor forces. So, the peace agreements were signed only after the Army of the Republic of BiH crushed the attacks of the aggressors, and that is what must not be lost sight of today, because I have a feeling, like, I believe, many of us here, that we would not be in the end allowed to be victorious. Because it was just enough that the embargo was imposed on us, we were supposed to be prevented from liberating our homeland with the weapons we took from the aggressors.
Each of the seven corps of the Army of the Republic of BiH has made a huge contribution to the defence of the homeland, however, here today I want to emphasize the importance of the Fourth Corps of the Army of the Republic of BiH, which during the aggression, almost the entire time fought against two enemies. Members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina felt the burden on their shoulders the most in this city, where they poured into, after they fled and were expelled from the south and southeast of our country. The heroic deeds of the people of Mostar who, as one of the Mostar commanders said, fought to the end, regardless of the price, saved not only this city, but also the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in this area. We should certainly never forget the struggle of the people of Konjic and Jablanica, which was of exceptional strategic importance for communication with Sarajevo. If the aggressor had managed to hijack the military industry in Konjic, the question is how this war would have ended. Maybe we would look at the same pictures like those from Srebrenica or the pictures we see today in Ukraine. Therefore, the importance of the Fourth Corps for the defense of the state is immeasurable, and I use this opportunity to congratulate my comrades on everything that has been done.
However, even thirty years later, the attacks on the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina have not stopped, they are only being conducted by other means. The judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia continue to be rejected, and on the basis of what has been ruled, the policies of some parties in the country are still being pursued and implemented, supported by policies from outside the country.
The ""Six"" verdict established that there was an international armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the state of occupation, in a way that neighbouring Croatia carried out control through local bodies in the so-called Herzeg-Bosna.
According to the verdict, the goal of this joint criminal enterprise was to establish an ethnically pure entity, at least partly within the 1939 Banovina of Croatia borders, and its annexation to Croatia, in order to re-establish the alleged unification of the Croat people in the event of disintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina or it becomes an independent state within Bosnia and Herzegovina, closely connected with Croatia.
In that regard, the verdict established, among other things, that the HVO and the so-called The Croat community of Herzeg-Bosna was in the function of achieving various aspects of the joint criminal enterprise of establishing an ethnically homogeneous space. It was especially established that Croatia, i.e. its then leadership, committed aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that Franjo Tuđman, Gojko Šušak and others were part of a joint criminal enterprise.
If we compare this with today's HDZ policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and especially with the views we hear from official Zagreb, we can clearly conclude that these are the same policies today, i.e. the continuation of the joint criminal enterprise in peacetime, through limited reform of the Constitution and electoral legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
How else to understand such an aspiration for ethnically pure constituencies, related to the parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina from which the so-called legitimate political representatives of the constituent peoples should be arriving. The involvement of neighbouring Croatia in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is realized through their satellites from the HDZ, can easily be shown by examples of undetermined interstate border, the problem around the border in Kostajnica, the issue of Trgovska gora, and unauthorized use of hydro potential from the Lake of Buško neighbouring Croatia benefits from on the basis of an agreement made with the so-called Herzeg-Bosna. And, finally, the issue of the interstate border at sea, where we are visibly faulted against, which HDZ representatives in the government structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina obstruct and do not allow these issues to be resolved. They are clearly working for the benefit and interest of neighbouring Croatia, and almost never in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Aren't these sufficient indicators of the continued realization of the goals of the joint criminal enterprise?
Let us add to that the story about the reform of the election legislation, which can only be done if European standards are fully applied, i.e. in accordance with what is ordered in the Opinion of the European Commission and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. And you know what the problem is? Those who would further ethnically divide this country and deliver our state sovereignty to neighboring Croatia and Serbia, giving them unlimited political power to govern our Bosnia and Herzegovina, will not accept something like that.
You will easily recognize which political actors are involved, and who directs their entire political activity towards the realization of the political interests of neighboring countries. That is absolutely unacceptable. This devalues our heroic struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must say a resounding NO to such people and stop any further ethnic and territorial division of the country, in order to preserve the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The country can be preserved and even improved in only one way, and that is that all its citizens have the same rights, that we organize the country as a state of equal citizens, regardless of their ethnic, religious or cultural affiliation. This is the ideal of a civil Bosnia and Herzegovina in which we are all equal, and thus it does not annul, usurp, or touch anyone's ethnic or religious identity.
Some may say that it is the idealism, that it is impossible, a utopia, but I think it is possible.
If in 1993 we did not believe that it was possible to defend the state, today we would not have a state like this, which is not perfect, but it is still ours and we do not have a better one. It is worth fighting for, and it is worth trusting the people who are sincerely fighting for it today. There are enough of them, and there will be as long as there are states. These may be the quietest among us, but therefore the most faithful ones.

93435,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Šefik Džaferović on the occasion of marking the 30th anniversary of forming of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 17th annivers,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93435&langTag=en-US,2022-04-15,"""Respected families of shaheeds and fallen heroes of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina! Disabled war veterans, war veterans! Gentlemen soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers! Generals! Congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the formation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
I also congratulate you on the Day of the 2nd Infantry - Ranger Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Through its formation and work, we preserve the tradition of our Army, its true achievements, courage, justice, multi-ethnicity and universality of the goals for which the Army fought.
The Second Infantry Ranger Regiment has been cherishing the heritage and the highest values and goals for which the Army of the Republic of BiH fought for and won for years, as the legal army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina! That is Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state of equal peoples and all its citizens.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This is an opportunity for all of us to remember the historical role of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in defending our homeland, to confirm and emphasize once again that we will continue to defend the values for which our best sons gave their lives and health, and that we must care for the families of shaheeds , fallen heroes and disabled veterans.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a state whose obligation and goal is to achieve the lofty idea of a free, independent and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina, free and prosperous for all its peoples and citizens, and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have significantly given, give and will continue to contribute to that, primarily through its professional execution of legally defined missions and tasks.
Our Armed Forces are the only legitimate military force of our state, made up of the people and citizens who live in it, ready to act and help on the entire territory. They are the only guarantor of peace and security both in the country and when it comes to taking part in the security structure of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic area. The process of reforms, in which the Armed Forces are still present today, is a process of their continuous advance towards NATO and the EU and in which they are growing into a respectable factor of stability and security in the region and beyond.
I must reiterate that defense reform is the most successful reform Bosnia and Herzegovina has made since the Dayton. The path is not the dismantling of what has been done, but the path is the further construction and strengthening of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is in the interest of everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Dayton Peace Agreement and 27 years of patiently built reforms are the framework within which Bosnia and Herzegovina and its Armed Forces can and must act. All this needs to be further improved and we need to especially fight for better technical equipment of the Armed Forces, as well as for a better financial status of members of the Armed Forces.
This is also an opportunity to thank NATO and the international community for their help and support in strengthening the unified Armed Forces of BiH, as well as their readiness to help us in the process of implementing the upcoming reform laws and decisions. What is especially worth emphasizing is that by engaging members of the AFBiH in peacekeeping and peace support missions and thanks to the constant progress in that field, today Bosnia and Herzegovina is no longer just a recipient, but also a provider of international military assistance. And the units of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are particularly responsible for that.
Gentlemen soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers,
We are proud of all of you, all of you who inherit the tradition of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which you carry in your heart every day, because you inherit pure, moral and universal values that are valid in all modern democratic societies.
Therefore, we expect you to continue the professional execution of tasks, because in that way you show military responsibility and loyalty to your homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina.
All of us together, the army and the state as one, are committed to a common goal. On this occasion, I would like to emphasize that our ultimate goal is admission and full membership in NATO and the European Union, and that only within Euro-Atlantic democratic institutions can we ensure economic prosperity and security of all citizens throughout BiH.
Once again, I congratulate you on the 30th birthday of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 17th anniversary of the 2nd Infantry - Ranger Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina! """
93326,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Šefik Džaferović at the Delphi Economic Forum VII, April 6, 2022, Delphi",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93326&langTag=en-US,2022-04-06,"Dear President Sakellaropoulou, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, It gives me special pleasure to be here with you, at the Economic Forum VII in Delphi, which is being held under the auspices of the President of Greece.
I thank the Delphi Economic Forum, the Nizami Ganjavi International Center and the Marianna Vardinoyannis Foundation for organizing this eminent event, as well as for inviting me to participate.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are living in a special historical moment. In recent years, there have been global movements which have resulted in an entirely new reality. This is a reality that is drastically different from the world we knew after the end of World War II, and especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Instead of the bloc division of the Cold War-era world, or the unipolar world of previous decades, a multipolar world has come to the fore. This world is characterized by a never larger number of relevant geopolitical actors, which puts to the test multilateral institutions a s well as traditional modes of action.
The state of geopolitical change, which began during the past decade, has escalated with Russian aggression against Ukraine. This event de facto moved the limits of geopolitical imagination on European soil in the 21st century. What seemed unthinkable became a reality.
There is a direct military aggression on the scene against a sovereign and independent state, a member of the United Nations. Civilians in Ukraine are being victims of atrocities. The horror scenes in Mariupol and the last scenes of the Bucha massacre are disturbing the conscience of humanity, as was the case with the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s and the massacre of civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which we thought would not happen again, at least not on European soil.
The issue of Russian aggression against Ukraine is not just a geopolitical issue. It is primarily a human question. It is a question of the struggle of Ukrainians for a bare life and survival. At the time when civilians are being killed and cities are being destroyed, much more important than analysis is raising the voice and awareness of what is happening. At the same time, it is completely unquestionable that this event has consequences primarily on the global security architecture, and then on all other sectors, from the economy, through energy and international transport, all the way to culture and sports.
The economic consequences of the war are already being devastating. The trends are relentless. As a large producer and a significant market, Ukraine has been an important link in the chain of the European economy. Consequently, the contours of the great crisis in food supply and the energy crisis are being outlined. The Russian Federation, which has brought down its capacity to be a reliable partner through this aggression, has also been an important link in the chain, as a large market and supplier of energy.
The adoption of an unprecedented set of sanctions, in response to the attack on Ukraine, raises some new questions. What is the potential of our common economy to transform and adapt, in the appropriate time frame, in order to avoid the most severe consequences. Furthermore, the diversification of energy supply chains in Europe is becoming a fateful process on the outcome of which much will depend.
Ladies and gentlemen,
One of the crucial issues after the aggression against Ukraine is if a spillover to other regions in Europe is possible, including the Western Balkans. It is a risk assessment made by the addresses with the highest degree of seriousness, primarily NATO and the European Union. This assessment is in line with the concerns of the public, including the population in the Western Balkans and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a central point in the security structure of the Western Balkans.
The biggest problem with the security of the Western Balkans and Bosnia and Herzegovina is that some political structures are still dreaming of changing borders. Despite the horrific experience of the 1990s, they have not yet given up on their intentions to change borders, with the aim of increasing the current size of the territory of certain states and reducing other states, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is an ideology that is primarily manifested in Bosnia and Herzegovina through secessionist tendencies. The bearers of these secessionist tendencies openly say that they are just waiting for a favorable geopolitical moment in order to start the final implementation of their intentions. Until then, they have been working on ""preparing the ground"", and we have seen this for more than half a year, when Republika Srpska entity embarked on a project to unilaterally annul 27 years of implementing the Dayton Accords, undermining the very foundations of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These actors, who are striving to secede certain parts from Bosnia and Herzegovina, will tactfully deny their intentions when faced with condemnation and pressure from the international community. But it is necessary to look at their actions more than their words, and it is clear that Republika Srpska authorities have not yet withdrawn unconstitutional laws and other measures, which they passed during the past six months, and which have been unequivocally declared secessionist in international institutions and the public.
Another dimension of the problem is the strong Russian influence on these political actors. The Russian Federation has been a political protector of these actors for years, and they in turn are working in favor of some of Russia's strategic interests, such as blocking NATO integration and creating permanent instability in the soft belly of the European Union and NATO.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has joined the international community in condemning Russian aggression, and pro-Russian political forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently blocking Bosnia and Herzegovina from implementing identical sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation by the European Union. Although it is our obligation, under the Stabilization and Association Agreement, to join these sanctions, it is evident that Russian influence is so strong that it prevents this.
That is why it is extremely important to maintain the continuous focus of the entire international public, and primarily NATO and the European Union, on the processes within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because, these processes are important not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also for the overall European security and stability.
One of the topics of this forum is the future of the European Union. As the largest peace project in history, the European Union has an exceptional role to play in the new situation. The European unity that was demonstrated on the occasion of Ukraine gave new energy to the European Union itself. Undermining the European and overall global security architecture has created awareness of the geopolitical importance of the functioning of the European Union and its enlargement.
The Ukrainian crisis has demonstrated that saturation with enlargement must be overcome, because enlargement is not a one-sided process, in which only new members would gain a lot and the old ones would lose. Enlargement is of mutual interest for both the European Union and the new members, especially when it comes to the Western Balkans. We need the European Union, but the European Union also needs the Western Balkans.
The biggest risk for the members of the European Union, in terms of security and new social problems, would be to leave the Western Balkans to third actors, who could destabilize the European Union itself through the Western Balkans. Therefore, enlargement must be seen as a geopolitical and strategic issue, not an administrative one. That is why the tangible progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries in the region towards the European Union would be crucial for European security.
In particular, granting candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina would be extremely important for overcoming the internal political crisis, and it would be a clear message, at an exceptional moment, that Bosnia and Herzegovina, like the entire Western Balkans, is part of the European system and will not fall under a new Iron Curtain, but will have a clear European and Euro-Atlantic perspective.
Thank you for your attention."
93073,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Šefik Džaferović at the opening of the exhibition ""National Treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina"" in the City Hall, (Vijećnica) 21 March, 2022",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=93073&langTag=en-US,2022-03-21,"Respected management of the Alija Izetbegović Foundation, esteemed representatives of the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina, distinguished guests from the Republic of North Macedonia, the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Croatia, distinguished representatives of judicial, legislative and executive authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Your Excellences, Eminences, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before us is one of the most important exhibitions of the written cultural heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the last half century: ""National Treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina"", organized on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence, which represents a kaleidoscope of our rich cultural past, stored in special collections of the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were rightly included in the list of national monuments of BiH in 2020.
This is the first time that the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina opens its special collections for the public on this scale and with such a wide domestic and international outreach. On the path leading to this exhibition, this core institution of culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina has gone through difficult trials. The most difficult event that would mark the last three decades of the Library's work and existence happened on 25 and 26 August, 1992, when a large part of the Library's fund burned down in an aggressor's attack on the City Hall (Vijećnica), the seat of the Library. The exhibition holds special significance for the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as this is the return of valuable documentary materials to the renovated City Hall.
The National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the synonymous with a hard and persistent struggle for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is time to find a solution for a sustained functioning of this institution.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
By organizing this event, the ""Alija Izetbegović"" Foundation, which bears the honorable name of the first president of the independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the late Alija Izetbegović, reaffirms its commitment to preserving and improving the fundamental processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which culture and cultural heritage surely are. The path taken by the ""Alija Izetbegović"" Foundation and the way it is managed can be a source of pride to all of us.
In terms of authorship, the exhibition is a real refreshment in the field of promoting cultural heritage in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The choice of material and the way it is presented shows erudition and breadth in understanding both the culture and the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only true dedication and knowledge can lead us to an exhibition such as this one.
Congratulations to the author and contributors who participated in the realization.
Someone nicely noticed: valuable documentary material stored in our libraries, archives and museums, should no longer be stored in a way that is accessible only to researchers and scientists. Just the opposite. The public at large is unaware of the value of the documents stored there. How are we going to protect our values if we have no knowledge of them? In this lies the additional significance of this exhibition, which will also soon be presented to the international public.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
the intellectual achievements of the people who overcame barbarism and ignorance, as Dr. Safvet-beg Bašagić once said, cannot be destroyed by the most vicious enemy even. The restored City Hall and the written cultural heritage that was preserved and exhibited tonight are a testament to this. That is my message to future generations.
In that name, I am opening the exhibition ""National Treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina“."
92858,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić at the reception held in the Sarajevo City Hall (Vijećnica) on the occasion of Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegov,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92858&langTag=en-US,2022-03-01,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina! On this day, 30 years ago, and by the will of the majority of the citizens of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we decided on the path of independence, sovereignty, freedom and democracy. The vote at the referendum on independence was an act of freedom, and the very independence, as experience has shown, is not just an act, but a process as well.
On 1 March 1992, the process of gaining our independence began. It was a painful and a difficult one, and, at the same time, as many times before in our history, which relies on the tradition of anti-fascist struggle, it was necessary and indispensable.
In that process for independence of our state, we fought in a sublime and dignified way, unfortunately with great sacrifices and help of the world that was, truth be told, usually lacking.
I often remember my fallen comrades. Yes, they would have been here with us today if they had had anything but their hearts to defend their homeland with. They lacked neither courage nor determination, nor love for the homeland. They had no dilemmas about what and for what they fought for. The only thing we lacked were means of deterrence from the oppressors and those to whom no rules, no honour, or anything belonging to the values of civilization applied to.
And yet, even with all of that, they did not defeat us, and did not destroy us, or the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That is why, today, enemies of our state know that we are not, as the old saying goes, a “rootless turnip”, and that we are even more prepared and determined to fight for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, if we have to.
The last thing we want is to have to fight again, but both are enemies and our friends should know that an honourable fight for freedom, democracy and human rights, for us, is an ideal more important than an undignified peace.
It is better to live for one day in freedom in your own state, than to live an eternity in someone else’s state or in humiliation.
As the shocking and disturbing example of Ukraine teaches us, independence of a state is not understood as a permanent category if you are surrounded by dishonest and malicious neighbours. And that is why I claim that independence is both a state and a process. The degree of independence also depends on the attitude towards one's country. Thirty years of attacks on our country, both from the inside and from the outside, are not only a sign of vulnerability, but a sign of strength and endurance. From this duality of strength and vulnerability comes the reality we live in.
The reality we live in forces us today, when the whole world recognizes and accepts the division into those who respect international law and the sovereignty of other states, and those who aggressively interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly detect who is on which side - who respects the sanctity of borders and the inviolability of sovereignty, and who considers it normal to support secessionist and destructive forces in other countries.
Who gives himself the right to attack another country without cause just because he is stronger or because he doesn't like something there, and who resolves misunderstandings within the framework of the international law and civilizational mechanisms? Who supports a state of free citizens, individuals, and who enables the corruption terror of narrow circles that feed on the concept of constitutiveness and group rights? Who is for the rule of law, and who is for the rule of force and crime? Who stands for the force of law, and who for the law of force?
Among these aforementioned contradictions, I am convinced that we recognize the dominant policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the politics and aggressive intentions of these politics, which are obviously outside of the democratic - civilizational circle, there must be no indulgence. We are the first ones that must oppose such politics.
That is why today, as we mark the 30th Anniversary of Independence, I would like us, as citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to forget all our internal and ideological political differences and to be proud of what we have. Only if we appreciate what we currently have, and we have a State, will we be able to build a state tailored to all its citizens in the future. A state that is sovereign, independent, and I emphasize, secure.
At the moment, our country is not what some of its loyal fighters imagined it to be 30 years ago, but it is also not what its enemies imagined, nor will it ever be. They assumed that we do not exist, but we did not consider it our duty to respect their assumptions.
That is why, above all, we need to respect ourselves more, at least for the sake of the generations of people who are growing and maturing. Generations that have no intention of going anywhere, even though they are being lured by more powerful people than us, because the love for our homeland is stronger than any mockery of it, because the truth is stronger than lies, and justice is superior than injustice. Let us remain persistent and proud of what we live for and what we believe in.
To all of us, happy Independence Day of our homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you for your attention."
92853,Address by the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Šefik Džaferović at the reception in the City Hall on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92853&langTag=en-US,2022-03-01,"Distinguished Chairman of the Presidency, Your Excellencies, dear friends, dear guests, Today we have gathered here for a special jubilee. Exactly three decades ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina embarked on the path to its independence. That is a big, I would say - epochal thing. Almost two thirds of the citizens, in a free referendum, chose to live in a sovereign and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was a vote for a state of equal citizens and peoples, Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs and everyone else. It was a voice for the freedom and survival of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at a time when plans were forged for division and destruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The referendum of the 29th of February and 1st of March 1992 was conducted in accordance with the rules of domestic and international law. Therefore, the democratic will of the citizens is expressed in a legal and transparent way, with full cooperation with the international community.
The act of the independence declaration was performed in accordance with all necessary procedures. This was confirmed by the fact that immediately after the declaration of independence, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized by the international community and admitted to the United Nations as an equal member. It should not be forgotten that those who wanted to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina also held some of their own referendums, but they were illegal, they were never recognized and from a legal point of view they remained null and void.
Those who did not have the law and justice on their side tried to achieve their goals - by means of ruthless force. When the brutal aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina began, it turned out that the only guarantor of its survival were the defenders. International law was indispensable for gaining independence, but it alone proved insufficient. It took strength to stand behind that law. That force was the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The freedom we won was paid dearly. We must never forget that. The truth about the period of aggression is written on the pages of the international courts. According to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice and the Hague Tribunal, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was unequivocally characterized as an international armed conflict, in which Serbia and Croatia participated. Leading civilian and military officials of Serbia and Croatia have been identified in these verdicts as members of joint criminal enterprises, with the aim of dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear friends,
On the 1st of March 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina did not gain independence for the first time, but restored it, after a century of foreign rule.
As one of the oldest countries in Europe, Bosnia and Herzegovina has never lost its identity, even in times when it was without political independence. The restoration of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the first session of ZAVNOBiH in 1943, and then the restoration of independence on the 1st of March 1992, was a natural consequence of the aspirations of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina for freedom.
Today's Bosnia and Herzegovina is organized on the foundations of the Dayton Peace Agreement, but it is in a relationship of continuity with the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the 1st of March 1992. The first article of the Dayton Constitution unequivocally speaks about the continuity of the existence of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which includes the continuity of its regulations, as well as the law on the basis of which we celebrate today's holiday.
Resistance to the 1st of March is contrary to the foundations of the Dayton Accord, because according to the Dayton Agreement, as well as in accordance with the 1st of March, Bosnia and Herzegovina is an independent state, a member of the United Nations, with its internationally recognized borders. Therefore, all those who accepted the Dayton Accords also accepted the results of the 1st of March. Or, in fact, they never sincerely accepted the Dayton Accords.
Dear friends,
We are in a particular historical moment. The crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been going on for more than half a year. The work of the institutions has been blocked and secessionist activities against the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina are gradually being conducted. The 27 years of the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement have been openly attacked, and the reactions of the Euro-Atlantic community are still mild and insufficient to stop the secessionist project of the RS entity authorities.
At the international level, the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine changed everything. The relationships that were implied are now brought into question. The Charter of the United Nations and international law have been ruthlessly violated. The situation indicates the need for the highest degree of vigilance, seriousness and responsibility.
The only way to preserve stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina is for everyone to unconditionally respect the Dayton Peace Agreement and 27 years of its implementation. Anyone who wants to take us back to 1995 has dangerous intentions. The international community, and above all the Euro-Atlantic community, must understand the seriousness of the moment and react preventively. By using political and defense-military mechanisms, the Euro-Atlantic community must protect the Dayton Peace Agreement, because that is their obligation even under that agreement.
The European Union and NATO must provide everything the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina need to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity. I hope that there will be enough common sense within Bosnia and Herzegovina by those who are already attacking the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina to stop in time, return to a constructive dialogue within the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue our development normally. Otherwise, they will be the biggest losers. They will not be able to harm Bosnia and Herzegovina. They can only harm peace and stability, and they will end up in the courts and in the dustbins of history.
The current crisis in Ukraine and the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and everything that is happening in that regard, should be a great warning to them.
The absolute interest of all citizens and all peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina is to preserve the independent and democratic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as defined by the referendum question. It is a state of equal peoples and citizens, in which everyone will feel comfortable in their own skin, on every inch of this country. We need a modern, democratic, functional state, a member of the European Union and NATO, which will be able to respond to the challenges of the modern age and human needs in it, because only in this way will new generations be able to plan their future in their own country.
On that behalf, to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I wish happy Independence Day.
Long live our Homeland – Bosnia and Herzegovina."
92801,Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the opening of the exhibition “Three Decades of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Independence”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92801&langTag=en-US,2022-02-28,"Ladies and gentlemen, Dear friends! It is my pleasure to attend the opening of the exhibition ""Three Decades of Independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina"" and the round table that follows.
I thank the Archives of the Federation for the organization as these are extremely valuable testimonies, needed even today. This exhibition, as well as the testimonies of the actors of the events of 30 years ago, help us today too, as we continue to respond to the challenges, and attempts at revision and relativization of historical events.
Needless to say, the role of the Archives is greatly important, as is the work you do. In your hands are the facts about what we were yesterday, what we are today, and what will make us known to and judged by the generations that come after us. That what is written remains, that what is not, as if it never existed. I respect your work, I support it and I support continuous investments in scientific research and its public orientation.
A little more than 30 years ago, at a time when black clouds rolled over Bosnia and Herzegovina, we chose the path to freedom. Our ideals, then and today, are the same. We were forced to fight for freedom, independence, but also democracy, and we made huge sacrifices. In addition to honourable defence against brutal aggression, international law is also at the foundation of our statehood. Its highest standards set the path, prescribed a standard that was consistently and transparently met. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, almost two thirds of them, of all ethnicities, showed political maturity, responsibility in the face of history and generations to come, and voted for the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was an exam without a resit. And we passed it.
In an answer to the question that determined our political destiny, every vote was important. Even today, every vote counts. We fight for every vote to be equally valuable. Equality is a fundamental value that we have not given up and which is now recommended and protected by international judgments. We respected international law norms in the period of calling the referendum, we respected them even during the brutal war, we respect them even today and we are guided by them.
All documents of the authorities of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina testify to that. In the whirlwind of war, chaos, despair and pain, and in the cities under siege, order, civilization, and the rule of law was preserved. Bosnia and Herzegovina will always, and I repeat always, respect the international legal norms and the highest standards of our civilization. That is built in the foundation of our statehood. The rule of law is also the basis of the functioning of the state, and that is the essence of the crisis we are currently in.
The Dayton Peace Accords, signed in Paris, ended brutal aggression in late 1995. Bosnia and Herzegovina won because it survived. Internationally recognized, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has continued its path as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I will repeat once again: on the 1st of March 1992, the proclaimed and immediately afterwards the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued its path as Bosnia and Herzegovina! I repeat, I will repeat, and we will repeat this fact until everyone understands it. And there are those who need to be educated about Bosnia and Herzegovina, in legal, political and every other sense. We will always be in the mood to talk about it and spread the truth.
In the context of the challenges that continue to come from the same great-state positions in our neighbourhood, I will reiterate that there are no guarantors of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Our neighbours are signatories to the Dayton Accords because they were participants in the international conflict, but that does not give them any special rights over Bosnia and Herzegovina or allow them to interfere in internal affairs. In addition to the signatories, there are mechanisms of the international community that help implement the Agreement.
The system established by the Dayton Peace Accords was not fair, but it was better than continuing the war. Also today, for all of us in BiH, for all peoples and citizens and every part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is better to adhere to the existing system that includes the Dayton Peace Agreement and the reforms we have achieved by consensus over the past 27 years then to go down the path of destabilization. Our system is expensive and irrational, and it works harder. It needs to be changed. But only with the consent of all.
The Euro-Atlantic path, on which we have reached a consensus in a legal way and in accordance with the prescribed procedures, is our geopolitical framework. Full NATO and the EU membership is the medium-term goal of our policies and focused reforms, and the standards and norms that these memberships bring are the best political practices and experiences that both citizens and constructive and authentic BiH policies accept as their ideals. There where life is better, safer and more prosperous, that system is better. That's why the EU and that's why NATO! Hence their values, and not some others.
We have been on that path for 30 years. The circumstances which we find ourselves under, fighting against very powerful and established enemies of both the state and the ideas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have made difficult and slow progress. Success and our victory lie in the fact that we have remained on the same path and that difficulties and challenges have not changed or distracted us from the civilized values and norms. We see today, unfortunately, that the forces of darkness have raised their heads and are roaring fire again. Now those shocking images are coming from the other side of Europe, but poison arrows are being fired at us as well.
Our painful experiences have made us wary and sensitive to such tendencies. We were concerned and we warned in time about any policy that puts one country ahead of another, considers one nation more important than another, one's faith better than another, justifies force and violence, and does not respect borders and sovereign will. Both in our region and beyond.
At the same time, the crisis in BiH is serious, many say the most serious since 1995, I do not want to diminish it. But it is very important to know that this crisis is not a conflict between ethnic groups. This is a projected political conflict and crisis produced artificially, but by very serious means, by irresponsible people and politicians. The politics of arbitrariness and insult, imitation of autocrats, attempts to create lawlessness and pacts with dark political forces, with the sludge of civilization, have their background and support at previously known addresses. These destructive forces cannot win and will be stopped. In addition, circumstances have changed significantly in favour of functional and efficient state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. What did not happen in 1992, it did not happen in 1995, nor will it happen in 2022. We have never had dilemmas, this time the international community does not have any dilemmas either. This can be seen from the statements of all relevant political figures, but also in the reports of relevant international media on BiH.
As a small state, we cannot fully influence the complex and slow mechanisms of the international community, nor global trends, but we have been vigilant, cautious, proactive and promptly unveiled threatening scenarios for Bosnia and Herzegovina and those issuing orders. And we go further, with God's help, in achieving the ideals of freedom, democracy and prosperity for all. There is nothing too much in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it is and can be enough for the safe and prosperous life of all its citizens. The winds of change are blowing again, we will rise our sails high to them and sail forward strong."
92633,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina H.E. Željko Komšić at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92633&langTag=en-US,2022-01-25,"Mister President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe At the beginning of my speech, allow me to thank you for the opportunity to address the Parliamentary Assembly in the year when Bosnia and Herzegovina is celebrating its 20th anniversary of entry into the Council of Europe. Also, allow me to use modern technologies as a means of addressing you, so that we can respect all measures set in place due to the new wave of this increasing infection with the COVID-19 virus. However, this will certainly not affect this opportunity to present to you the current socio-political situation in my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Of course, I will give my presentation through a special prism of those Council of Europe fundamental values, that I personally continuously advocate in my work, and which, I am sure, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina wish to see embedded in our country's political and social system.
Therefore, at the very beginning of my address, I will briefly review the main principles established during the founding of the Council of Europe in 1949, namely: protection of human rights, multiparty parliamentary democracy and rule of law, spreading awareness of European identity, conclusion of specific international treaties, securing continent's unity, finding solutions to social problems in Europe.
The reason behind these goals is understandable after the end of World War II. In the war-ravaged Europe, many countries were in the process of transition towards the fundamental principles of liberal democracy, and, at the time, that was not an easy task.
The context of the time, especially that of geopolitical nature, led to the creation of two poles, of a distinctly ideological nature, one turned towards liberal democracy and market economy, and the other towards communist doctrine and centralized economy. A bipolar world order was created on the global level, which lasted for almost five decades, until the fall of the Berlin Wall, when a whole series of transition processes began in various European countries.
Today, however, we have utterly different geopolitical relations in the world, based on a multi-polar world order and global powers' interests development, which are produced and manifested in different countries of the world. In such circumstances, there is a number of countries that have not completed their transition processes, in accordance with the principles of liberal democracy and market economy, which makes them an ""easy prey"" for various geopolitical interests of big players.
My country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a country with a tradition spanning for almost a thousand years, and, at different points in time, it had its own different internal arrangements. At one point in history, Bosnia was a kingdom lasting for several centuries, and, at that time, given the size of its territory, it was the largest country in this region. After that, there had been conquests of Bosnia and Herzegovina by various kingdoms and empires, bringing their culture, customs and religion, and incorporating them into the social system of my country. Still, Bosnia and Herzegovina has survived and outlived such kingdoms and empires.
During the World War II, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina had joined the anti-fascist movement en masse, participating on the side of those forces that fought against Fascism and Nazism. At the same time, they also made the decision to restore our statehood and join the former Yugoslavia, together with other former republics. Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in the former Yugoslavia lasted until March 1992, when the citizens decided, in a referendum, to make Bosnia and Herzegovina a sovereign and independent state. That same year, the Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted as a democratic expression of its citizens, which had already contained the basic principles of liberal democracy and market economy, principles identical to those embedded in the foundations of the Council of Europe. Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the United Nations in May 1992, thus gaining the status of a subject of international law.
In these aforementioned time periods, Bosnia and Herzegovina was never a country of divided or segmented society, nor has there been any form of discrimination against its citizens.
However, the declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina led to an aggressive reaction of the neighbouring countries, which, in the period of war from 1992 to 1995, during the aggression against my country, sought to obliterate any existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and claim parts of its territory through war and conquest.
Such war activities have led to unprecedented horrors, escalating to committing crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.
All these elements, which I have mentioned, were determined in the judgments by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague. The judgements have established the existence of several joint criminal enterprises, involving individuals and groups from Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as those from neighbouring countries, aimed at establishing ethnically clean territories in order to annex such “cleansed” territories to those neighbouring countries.
The reason I speak of this is because, in the second part of my presentation, I will clearly point out that such policies are still present in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, but the method of war conquest has been replaced with political and diplomatic means, that is, there are some who are still trying to implement their war goals in peacetime.
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended with the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace, which was initialled in Dayton and signed in Paris in 1995. It was signed by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (whose legal successor is today's Serbia), or, as clearly stated in the international law - the peace agreement is usually signed by participants of the war.
This removes any sort of a dilemma that there was a civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, because it was an interstate armed conflict, as established, among other things, by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in several of its judgments.
An integral part of this Agreement, colloquially called the Dayton Agreement, is the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as its Annex 4. So, it is obviously an imposed constitution, and not an expression of the democratic will of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rather, it is a document that is a part of a peace agreement. It defines Bosnia and Herzegovina as a country with two entities and one district, with different ethnic communities.
In that Constitution, which we must all respect, many open questions and ambiguities remain, leaving a lot of room for various arbitrary interpretations, most often inspired by particular interests of different political elites, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the neighbouring countries.
This Constitution has established a new political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that was to evolve according to democratic standards and values, such as those contained in the goals of the Council of Europe. Unfortunately, that never happened.
In contrast, active ethnic politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina have sought, and still do, to create an artificially divided society dominated by ethnic affiliation as the only valid licence for political action. Although the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is an integral part of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I must point out here that it is, unfortunately, under-implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Their reason for such ambitions lies in that unfortunate term of ""constituent"" which is mentioned in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the Constitution contains no legal elaboration or statement or determination of what that actually means.
That is why a new legal practice has emerged, one I consider highly dangerous, and that is to achieve various political goals through the use of the term ""constituent"", in which domestic political actors participate, with visible political support from neighbouring countries. In such, as I see it, wrong political and legal practice, one's ethnicity becomes a conditio sine qua non for any form of political activity, which goes as far as that one cannot even get a job if one is not of the appropriate ethnicity. Isn't that a visible form of systemic discrimination, which unfortunately exists in my country?
As a legalist, here, I can freely say that the term ""constituent"" is actually the source of systemic discrimination in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been established in five judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, listed chronologically hereafter: Sejdic-Finci, Zornić, Pilav, Šlaku and Pudarić. These judgments have clearly established the existence of discrimination based on ethnicity and place of residence, and ordered the respondent, ie. the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to make the necessary changes to its Constitution, from which all elements of discrimination must be removed. Unfortunately, that never happened.
If we look at what was stated in the Sejdić-Finci judgment, then we will see that ethnic discrimination is a derivative of racial discrimination. Do we need something like that in today's Europe and in the modern liberal democratic order? That is a question for all of us, not just for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I am absolutely certain we will all agree that we do not need such legal or even constitutional frameworks and that we must, all together, make effort to combat all forms of discrimination.
There is a part form the Zornić Case judgement that is particularly interesting. It clearly states that Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have full democracy, but limited or restricted democracy through the distribution of political power between ethnic communities, which in my country are called ""constituent peoples."" This lack of full democracy is, in fact, in stark contrast to one of the fundamental goals of the Council of Europe.
That is why the Zornić judgement orders Bosnia and Herzegovina to change its Constitution to enable the realization of full democracy in which there will be the necessary equality of every citizen of my country. This is a very important issue.
How else can we achieve the rule of law or organize a law based state, if all citizens of any country, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, without exceptions, are not equal before the law?
How can we achieve liberal democracy, at the core of which is the struggle of equality against all forms of inequality, if we know that in Bosnia and Herzegovina the imposition of a system of inequality is being politically forced?
Then it is certainly not a liberal democracy, and I find that unacceptable.
It is obvious that the current political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on ethnicity, is creating three parallel totalitarian systems, based on the affiliation to one of the three ethnic communities, which they seeks to govern in an autocratic way.
In such a system, through ethnic communities’ affiliation, as an expression of ethnic politics’ exclusivity, there are efforts to rule over resources, jobs, tenders, public procurements, all kinds of privileges, profits or gains, which clearly creates an environment for corruption of unimaginable proportions. After 26 years of the Dayton Accords, instead of evolving the political system of Bosnia and Herzegovina into one based on democracy and the rule of law, my country is moving down a regressive path. While pushing this country backwards and away from democracy, there are efforts to maintain and even strengthen the ethnic political system that generates corruption in all parts of society, through the use of ethnic politics and manipulating with fear the members of different ethnic communities.
It is important to underline that such ethnic politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina reach for the emotions and empathy within their communities once all other tools for ruling over their ethnic communities have been exhausted. They do so by instigating fear that, ultimately, forms a system conducive to corruption and denial of the rule of law. I believe we share the same opinion; such a political system has no place in modern Europe.
Allow me to use this opportunity to address, in a few sentences, the different ideas of those who seek to maintain the principle of inequality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who propose the introduction of consociational democracy, by allegedly copying the political systems of Belgium, Switzerland, Northern Ireland or South Tyrol. There are at least two problems here. First, consociational democracy is not the same as liberal democracy, and it does not exist in the aforementioned countries or in parts of other countries, in the way that it was imagined.
Such countries or parts of specific countries have a completely different historical context from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and those political systems are simply not compatible with my country.
The second problem is that the possible introduction of consociational democracy to Bosnia and Herzegovina would certainly lead to new proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights, because this type of political model is based on inequality and annulment of fundamental principles of liberal democracy, regardless of the fact that it contains elements of proportional representation as one of its principles. Using such long-outdated political models in Bosnia and Herzegovina would certainly be a step backwards.
Such politics go as far as to deny the existence of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian nation, a country that has existed for almost a thousand years. They wish to portray every expression of nationality through the issue of ethnicity. Today, I want to say that I am a Bosnian and Herzegovinian by nationality and a Croat by ethnicity, because nationality is an expression of belonging to one's own state. Neighbouring countries deny the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, trying to use the ethnic identities in my country to their advantage, creating such an environment that we, Bosnians and Herzegovinians, should ask them for consent, whether we can be Bosnians and Herzegovinians by national affiliation. This is absolutely unacceptable and in complete contradiction with the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
On the other hand, when we look at the decision-making system, today in Bosnia and Herzegovina we have a situation where the existence of any majority in the lower houses, i.e. directly elected legislative bodies, is completely made void through a new political tool called ""entity voting.""
In a nutshell, this means that in the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has 42 MPs, even just five of them can block any decision-making, because they come from one of the two entities. Is such a thing an expression of liberal democracy? Of course not, because it is obvious that a political minority can stall any decision-making to the detriment of the political majority, until that minority is satisfied. We have something like this today in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This country is being held in a political hostage crisis through obvious separatist activities, which ultimately hides the system of blockades, blackmails and keeping Bosnia and Herzegovina in complete political uncertainty, until the wishes and intentions of some political leaders are met.
Isn't that an expression of a complete autocracy and a lack of fundamental principles of democracy?
To make matters worse, the reason for keeping Bosnia and Herzegovina in a state of crisis is because someone refuses to accept the judgments of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, that have established the crime of genocide had been committed. Just imagine now, what would disrespecting the decisions of any court mean in your countries? Undoubtedly, the criminal liability of those who fail to respect the judgments of the courts.
The situation is similar with the decision-making process in the upper house of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina called the House of Peoples, which consists of 15 indirectly appointed MPs, where two of them can block any decision-making process in such a way that even if all 42 MPs from the House of Representatives make a unanimous decision, it takes only two of them from the House of Peoples to bring it all down, due to necessary entity majority vote.
Isn't this a clear indicator of inequality of MP votes in the two Houses of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the vote of one Member of the House of Peoples, appointed by political parties, has at least three times more value than that of an MP from the House of Representatives elected by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
This is being used today as a political tool, in order to prevent the normal functioning of the institutions of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with complete disregard for fundamental democratic principles, and I find that unacceptable. This is also the cause for the newest appellation before the European Court of Human Rights pertaining to the inequality of votes in the two parliamentary houses in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, for the past 26 years, the application of the concept of ""constituent peoples"" and ethnic voting in everyday political decision-making in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, does not serve to protect the rights of ""constituent peoples"" but to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from stabilizing and progressing.
Since 2008, when BiH signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union, parties supporting ethnically based decision-making system have used ethnic quotas in decision-making in the executive and legislative bodies to prevent the adoption of European standards. Laws concerning the adoption of the EU acquis fail precisely in the Houses of Peoples or through entity voting in the BiH House of Representatives. This happens almost regularly, even though the laws of the acquis communautaire do not affect ethnic identity, culture, tradition, language or education as values that the Houses of Peoples should protect.
For this reason, dozens of laws from the European agenda are at a standstill in the parliamentary procedure. That is why we cannot fill out the Constitutional Court of the Federation of BiH, why there are no appointments of governing bodies of many independent law enforcement agencies, and why we are wasting European funds. There are many other things that are to the detriment of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all under the guise of fighting for the legitimate ethnic interests of the ""constituent peoples"".
This is, therefore, an abuse of the rights of the ""constituent peoples"" to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from becoming a part of a civilized community of European parliamentary democracies and never becoming a member of the EU. Such policies are intended to turn my country into a territory where foreign regimes will have an influence, either through economy, or by creating a new ""Transnistria"" in the Western Balkans from one of its parts.
I would like to remind you that even the European Commission has precisely and legally identified, in the ""Opinion"" from 2019, everything that my country needs to improve in order to continue its long path towards the candidate status.
In that moment, political actors advocating the disappearance of Bosnia and Herzegovina decided to stop all processes and bring 3.5 million people back to 1995, by talking about the rights of ""constituent peoples"", restoring entity competences, and, finally, giving an anti-civilizational resistance towards punishing denial of adjudicated genocide and war crimes.
Nowadays, when there is talk in Bosnia and Herzegovina about the necessity to amend the Constitution and the Election Law, with the goal of implementing five judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, we again have the emergence of those political forces that have no intention to implement those judgments, but are rather trying to create a new constitutional arrangement and electoral system with deeper discrimination that would be shielded behind the inequality of votes of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, neighbouring countries also have direct participation in that and their goal is very clear - to achieve all wartime goals using political and diplomatic means in peacetime.
Their intention is reflected in two aspects. The first is to create a system, through amendments to the Constitution and the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where those neighbouring countries will have a ""golden share"" or a key word in all decision-making in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus complete control over my country. Such intentions are easily recognized every time they talk about the ""constituency of peoples"" or in the phrase how they will accept ""everything that the three ethnic communities agree upon.""
Regardless of the fact that they are striking at the foundations of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, they often do something like that in diplomatic talks, even before you, for I believe, even you were occasionally faced with that.
And second, when they see that such a thing cannot succeed, then they reach for their allies in Bosnia and Herzegovina who, on behalf of those neighbouring countries, block the work of Bosnia and Herzegovina's institutions, trying to create an illusion that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a dysfunctional state.
In addition to invading my country's political system, through their political satellites in Bosnia and Herzegovina, neighbouring countries are trying to obtain complete control over my country's natural and all other resources. How else to explain political intentions of neighbouring countries not to define the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina through an international border agreement, both on land and at sea, but with the goal of them having an option to manage the natural resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
Therefore, I use this opportunity to ask all of you not to accept this type of diplomatic talks, because it harms Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to point out my vision of a solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina. First of all, I strongly believe, and I cannot back down on this, that it is necessary to achieve equality for every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to create a society of equal opportunities.
This would eliminate all forms of discrimination associated with the phenomenon of ""constituent peoples"". Let me emphasize this once again; it is a principle or a tool for creating an environment of incalculable and persistent corruption or a society where those who succeed are not the best among us, but those who are politically suitable or family connected and appointed through nepotism.
A system dominated by systemic corruption is not acceptable in any modern society, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Second, it is necessary to change the political system of Bosnia and Herzegovina from a limited or a restricted democracy and establish a system of full democracy, as set out in five judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, but also in accordance with the 2005 Venice Commission's Opinion, which has analytically, accurately, and legally specified all the changes that Bosnia and Herzegovina must make if it wants to be a part of modern democratic societies.
Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you all to get acquainted with the Venice Commission's Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2005, because it is very important that we accept its Opinion as the Council of Europe's assistance to countries in transition.
Finally, changes to the Constitution and the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina must not be made without respecting the fundamental principles of liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law, because everything else will lead my country to additional instability, and thus to the instability of the entire Western Balkans region. We all know very well that a citizen, an individual, is the bearer of the sovereignty of a country, and this must also be applied in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I use this opportunity to ask you all not to agree to any of the diplomatic and political talks that seek to harm Bosnia and Herzegovina, and you will easily recognize such talks - they will be outside of the fundamental principles of the Council of Europe.
Thank you for your attention."
92271,Speech by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Željko Komšić on the occasion of the opening of the Third Regional Forum for the Prevention of Violence against Women in the Western,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92271&langTag=en-US,2021-12-02,"Dear representatives of UN WOMEN, Respected Minister, Representatives of institutions and non-governmental organizations, Forum participants...
I am glad that Bosnia and Herzegovina is the host of this important event organized by UN WOMEN in cooperation with the Gender Equality Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Union and the Council of Europe.
Our country is continuously committed to activism against gender-based violence. In the past period, we have made significant progress in preventing violence against women and girls and achieving the goals of gender equality. In 2013, Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention. The Gender Equality Agency of our country has been actively working on successful implementation of the Convention. That includes organizing the first Council of Europe Regional Conference and initiating regional cooperation for the most successful exchange of experiences and good practices. Following the 2019 initiative of the Gender Equality Agency, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina established a Committee for Monitoring Implementation and Reporting on the Istanbul Convention and Femicide in our country. The task of the Committee is to monitor, analyze and report to the Council of Ministers on the situation regarding violence against women and domestic violence.
In addition to all the challenges we face in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding this Convention, several reforms have been undertaken in order to harmonize the legislative and institutional framework. The goal is to effectively combat violence against women and domestic violence. That is an obligation we have undertaken by ratifying the said Convention. Significant efforts have been made to provide general protection and support services for victims of violence. Relevant laws and bylaws are continuously harmonized with the Istanbul Convention standards.
Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and UN WOMEN has paved the way towards a systematic solution for the issue of gender-based violence. Their continuous support is of great importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as for the continuation of good practice and cooperation between the countries of the region, and the contribution to the preservation of peace and good partnership. There is still a lot of work ahead of us, but I am convinced that together we will succeed.
It is extremely important to talk about this topic in order to raise public awareness about the problems women face in our society. As I have said before, violence against women and girls is not, and must not be, a problem of any individual. We are all obliged to recognize the characteristics and forms of violence in our surroundings and to act promptly to avoid fatal consequences.
The prejudices faced by the Bosnian society, as well as, I believe, many other societies in the region, must not be an obstacle to further progress and harmonization of our laws and practices with international standards.
Movements such as “I did not ask for it/You are not alone” show us that violence against women continues to go unnoticed and unpunished in our societies. Now is the time to react! We must all work together towards equality of all our citizens by affirming the values of a democratic society.
Therefore, this type of exchange and regional cooperation is a good example of how to point out all the challenges we face, how to show good examples of overcoming those challenges and how to learn from each other.
I am convinced that this Regional Forum will contribute to even greater motivation, more knowledge and broader partnerships in the fight against violence and discrimination against women and girls in our region.
On behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I wish you all a warm welcome and successful work of this Regional Forum."
92244,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić at the central ceremony to mark the 16th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92244&langTag=en-US,2021-12-01,"Good morning to all here present, and especially to the members of the Armed Forces, to whom I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the 16th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
16 years ago, we set out on the path of establishing our joint, professional, Bosnian-Herzegovinian army. Our goal was for our country to get armed forces that would be formed on the principles on which the armed forces of NATO member states are based. The principles whereby the ethnicity or religion of a soldier, or whether that soldier is different from others in any way, is not important. It is two things that are important: the ability of the soldier, and whether s/he is loyal to our Armed Forces. 16 years later, my assessment is that we are much more successful than some had hoped or expected. 16 years later, we have a professional army which meets high standards, which is ready to respond to numerous challenges, and which should make every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina proud.
There are a number of examples that testify to the success of the Armed Forces, and much could be said about it, but perhaps it is enough to mention the military exercises in which our units participated this year, when they showed enviable readiness.
I did not attend some exercises, such as the EUFOR Quick Response exercise or the SEL-2 assessment exercise, including the last one you conducted in Rajlovac, but I received reports. And that the reports about the high professionalism of our army are accurate, I could see for myself when I attended the exercise ""Quick Response 21"" at Manjača in May this year. That exercise, conducted in partnership with the United States Armed Forces, was a testament to your work and effort. Proof of your readiness and dedication.
For all the exercises organized this year, the reactions of experts, especially from the armed forces of NATO member states, are the same, and that is that our Armed Forces show high readiness and interoperability with the United States military and the armed forces of European countries. I congratulate you on that.
Your successes, however, are not just military, because your actions allow us to progress politically as well. Your results carry a process of meeting the standards that will take us to NATO. And those standards apply to other spheres of our social life. These standards are a guarantee that we will have a freer and more equal society, that we will have transparent institutions and more justice in society. These are the standards we strive for, which are demanded of us by both the European Union and NATO, and which we will find difficult to meet without your continuous work and commitment.
Although you have done your job, fulfilled your obligations responsibly, in recent months individuals have questioned the existence of the Armed Forces. No need to waste words on explaining how irresponsible the announcements are. Announcements dangerous to the security of the entire state and all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Publicly questioning the existence of our military forces, especially from the position of a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an institution that is the supreme commander of our Armed Forces, is a very serious threat to peace and security in our country.
Your best response to such destabilizing statements is to continue to do your job with dedication as you have done to date. To proudly wear your uniform, fulfill your tasks and responsibly represent the Armed Forces. The foundations of equality and capabilities on which the Armed Forces are built, and the professionalism you have shown so far, guarantee that the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to exist for a long time, that the Armed Forces will be above any policy or individual, and that they will continue to serve as an example of what kind of institutions are possible in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That you will serve as an example of what kind of a state is possible.
Thank you for serving our country. All the best!"
92170,"The speech by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić to mark the 25th November, the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=92170&langTag=en-US,2021-11-24,"Dear citizens of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, On this 25th of November, we mark the 78th anniversary of the restored statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is, we remember the first session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina which was held in Mrkonjić Grad.
The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was renewed in the conditions of fascist occupation and terror of national quislings who got carried away by great-power and nationalist ideas and programs. Unfortunately, they have not been defeated yet, and even today they continue with their policy of sowing hatred and the policy of destroying the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
78 years ago, at the first session of ZAVNOBiH, these policies suffered a political and later a military defeat. The victory was won by the anti-fascist policy of the People's Liberation Movement, led by the Supreme Commander Josip Broz Tito, which was an integrative factor that gathered around itself the broadest strata of the population. This policy did not insist on ideological divisions, but on unity in resistance to the occupier and traitors of the state. That's why such policy succeeded then.
The success of that policy at that time was not only in the victory of civilization over anti-civilization, although in a symbolic sense it was the most important. That success was both concrete and tangible. One of the greatest, and in fact the most important achievements of ZAVNOBiH, is the beginning of the building of the institutions of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Without government institutions, which were at the very beginning only political, Bosnia and Herzegovina could not have come to life as a Republic, nor would there ever have been the possibility of international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state.
What features today are exactly attacks on state institutions. The attacks come precisely from those policies that suspended ZAVNOBiH in the part of the territory they control during the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. First, they suspended it as a value by committing crimes against the state and its citizens, and then officially through documents.
And it was no accident. Declaring principles of anti-fascism, which are weaved into the very core of this state, as invalid could only be done by such assembly which then, like some nowadays, tried to put itself above the state and to position itself in such a way as to disfranchise the state with the aim of destroying it. The historical assessment of such a policy was given by the judgments of international courts. However, the verdicts only establish the facts and nothing more. It is up to us who are for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina to learn lessons.
I dare say that we did not learn the lessons, because we are facing the same challenges again. The challenge is how and in what way to prevent attacks on state institutions, which were founded during ZAVNOBiH, while preserving what is most important after the state, and that is peace. Preserving the state will only be possible if we unite and if we finally stop tolerating or finding different kinds of justifications for those who blatantly demonstrate the intention to dismantle the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There is no justification for continuously undermining the institutions of the state, and anyone who tries to relativize or justify such actions does not do any good to this state, not to mention another word that would be inappropriate on this special day. The enemies of this state must know that by continuing to attack its institutions, they risk everything, and they will get nothing.
ZAVNOBiH contains another important lesson that says that the historical experience of the struggle for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina teaches us that we must first and foremost rely on our own forces. The Allies did not give victory and the state to the People's Liberation Movement, which restored the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the People's Liberation Movement won that victory with great difficulty and great sacrifice, which was eventually recognized and respected.
Even this Bosnia and Herzegovina, which according to the Dayton Constitution enjoys its state-legal continuity, was not given to us, but was won. That is why we must never lose sight of the following: whatever attacks on the state and its institutions are carried out, or whatever solutions on the definitive ethnic division of the state are offered, none of this will happen unless we ourselves give up on our own state.
I am convinced not only that we will not give up on the state, but that we will defend it and its institutions by all democratic means. The fate of our state is not in the hands of those we know too often to ask for help, but in the hands of those of us who live here and who will stay with it no matter what happens. Being with our state, unreservedly and without calculation is a matter of our own dignity and that is something that can never be taken away from us.
No matter how much many try to attribute every failure of an individual to the failure of the state or characterize every success of an individual as a success despite the state, they will never succeed in making the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be disgusted with their homeland. They will fail to convince the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they need to replace this piece of land under the sky with another place, in order to live happier lives. Bosnia and Herzegovina has endured greater forces than those who spread all kinds of defeatism, apathy, and universal criticism aimed at convincing the majority of the citizens of this country that the state is of no value.
Its thousand-year existence is best proof that continues to deny the defeatist claims. It will continue to exist even when we are no longer alive, because a new generation of Bosnians and Herzegovinians will come who have enough of their own dignity, courage, and strength to defend the state and build a democratic society of equal citizens.
That is what I believe in!"
91959,"Statement by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željko Komšić, at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91959&langTag=en-US,2021-11-02,"Dear Prime Minister Johnson, Distinguished presidents, prime ministers and members of delegations of all countries, Representatives of the non-governmental sector, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to greet you all at this important conference on climate change. This conference takes place at a time when we daily face the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic and series of climate challenges that pose a difficult task for the future of the whole world.
That is why it is important to reach an agreement on how to accelerate global action against climate change, in order to maintain the global temperature increase below 1.5°C and prevent climate change from spiraling out of control.
Each of our countries faces different challenges. Regardless of that, it is necessary to be on the same page in the fight against the climate crisis, and to act together. It is also necessary to set realistic and achievable goals. Significant financial resources will be needed to implement those goals, especially in countries with lower GDP per capita, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
My country is making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, in the coming period, we will have to invest more energy and more funds in order to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. I am pleased to share with you today that Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in April this year, reaffirming its commitment to fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement.
By submitting this document, Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes one of the first countries in the Western Balkans to adopt an updated NDC with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 33.2% by 2030 and almost 66% by 2050.
In order to meet our goals of climate change prevention, we are also working to enable the transition to sustainability and creating an attractive environment for private sector investment in clean, affordable energy. We will need substantial international assistance in the areas of technology transfer and development of financial mechanisms to encourage decarbonisation. The same goes for financial support to the climate issues projects.
With the goal of further decarbonisation of the energy sector, Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Sofia Declaration on the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans in November 2020. BiH thus committed to work together with the EU to make Europe a climate-neutral continent by 2050.
In that regard, one of our current most important activities is the development of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for the period 2021-2030 (NECP BiH). That document aligns multiple objectives: those of the European Union in the field of energy and climate, those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement and the Energy Community.
Our plan in Bosnia and Herzegovina will define goals for improving the energy efficiency measures, increasing the share of renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It will also include the policies and measures to achieve those goals. We aim to set ambitious goals for each of the dimensions of the Plan, which we believe are realistic to be achieved by 2030, and which will enable further development of the energy sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I would like to emphasize that within the development of the National Energy and Climate Plan, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also working on the development of a Coal Region Transition Road Map. Such transition of the coal regions and the entire energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina has to be a fair one. It must provide for the switch from coal to renewable energy sources without any loss of jobs.
Regarding the energy sector, defining ways to finance the energy transition is of the utmost importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The energy transition will require significant investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. Bosnia and Herzegovina, like many other countries, will need substantial international financial assistance and support for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by 2050. Special focus must be on the planned closure of coal mines and the shutdown of coal-fired power plants.
There is no doubt that Bosnia and Herzegovina wishes to contribute to the fight against climate change. However, we will not be able to do this alone. We need the support. We have to cooperate with the countries that can accelerate this process with their knowledge and resources. Regardless of the fact that I do not represent a country with a large population, it will be necessary for everyone to contribute to the efforts to stop climate change. You can certainly count on us.
Thank you for your attention. I wish everyone a successful continuation of the Conference, which I hope the history will remember as a milestone in the fight to save our planet.
Thank you."

Željko Komšić Brdo European Union – Western Balkans Summit, 6.10.2021
President of the European Union,
President of the European Commission,
President Janša,
Your Excellences, ladies and gentlemen!
I welcome your commitment to the European values and principles, as well as your commitment to continue the process of enlargement of the European Union to the Western Balkans. I believe that enlargement to the Western Balkans only makes sense if it will truly mean the establishment of the European values and principles in the Western Balkans, as well as respect for the basic achievements of democracy in a civilized society.
I share your opinion that, in the light of European values, the primary activity of the Western Balkans, and thus Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be aimed at developing a full and stable democracy, protection of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, all through the rule of law.
I support the need for resolute efforts towards reconciliation and regional stability, which should serve the Western Balkans and some EU member states to harmonize bilateral relations, in which the legacy of the war in our region still has a prominent place, ie to leave it in the past and let's focus on the European future of the Western Balkans region. In such bilateral relations, it is neither good nor wise for individual countries to use their status as members of the European Union to exert a direct influence on neighbouring countries aspiring to join the European Union, both politically and culturally and socially. Such an approach will not bring the desired result, but will only be a new instigation of various forms of destabilization. This can only suit those geopolitical players whose strategic goals include stopping the enlargement and strengthening of the European Union.
In this context, I welcome the efforts of the European Union embodied in the European Investment Plan and the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, which include financial support of 30 billion euros for the region over the next seven years. But let us speak openly and state that this will be made possible if we follow the Berlin Process and the forming of the already signed Joint regional market we know by the acronym CRM. That is why we in Bosnia and Herzegovina see and consider the Berlin Process as a form of a two-way communication with the European Union.
A carbon-neutral economy and a digital agenda are the future of the Western Balkans, as they are the future of the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to participate in the energy transition to green energy sources, but our energy capacities are still mostly based on coal, and their lifespan is coming to an end. By shutting down the existing coal capacities, Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a large shortage of electricity, which will not be easy to replace with green energy capacities in the short term. Therefore, we gladly expect any help from the European Union in that field and experience in a fair energy transition, which will reduce the social impact, both on the endangered categories of the population, and on those whose existence is connected to the existing energy capacities.
The second extremely important activity is the accelerated work on the development of the transport network and the completion of the construction of Corridor 5c, but also the start of work on the Adriatic-Ionian road through Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this regard, we expect more significant effects of the activities of the Transport Community in the near future.
I fully support the acceleration of the implementation of the commitments agreed at the Berlin Process Summit in Sofia in November 2020 and more agile, ie accelerated work on the creation of the Common Regional Market (CRM) under the auspices of the Berlin Process and with the active involvement of existing specialized regional organizations such as CEFTA, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), the Energy Community and the Transport Community in order to best direct €30 billion for the infrastructural, energy and economic integration of the Western Balkans with the European Union.
On the issue of the common foreign and security policy, for which we have committed Bosnia and Herzegovina to be in constant harmonization with the European Union to the fullest extent possible, I share concerns about current security challenges, including third-party activities and the migrant crisis.
Your Excellencies,
Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to its European path despite all the challenges and various political influences of third parties. I call on the member states of the European Union to preserve the process of European integration for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign and independent country of equal citizens, who need to see their future in their homeland. I believe that internal disagreements must be overcome in order to bring the European values and standards to Bosnia and Herzegovina and enable our citizens to stay in their country, not because of the European perspective, but because of improved quality of life and a guarantee of the protection of the basic human rights and freedoms, in accordance with the achievements of a civilized society.
For such a thing to be possible, I expect the European Union not to give up its own values, principles and standards in all Western Balkan countries, because giving up those values due to short-term goals could have long-term consequences for the European Union itself.
That is why it is important that we send an important message from today's Summit - that the Western Balkans should make the transition towards the European values and standards as soon as possible and that, in that regard, the European Union will provide all necessary assistance and support.
Thank you for your attention."

President Tusk, thank you for everything you are doing for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thank you for the leadership you show at protecting the values of the free world.
Esteemed friends,
Our time is a time of crisis. We first witnessed the economic crisis, then the migrant and climate crisis, and now the unprecedented health crisis of our generation. The crisis is beginning to be our permanent state.
It is no longer news that we live in a time of tectonic movements. This was clearly confirmed by the withdrawal of allied troops from Afghanistan. The collapse of the institutions there and the humanitarian crisis which followed have raised a number of questions. The vulnerability of the European Union on the global stage has been shown. The discussion on the strategic autonomy of the European Union is being renewed these days. The need for the EU to be a geopolitical actor, not an object, is loudly emphasized.
If we are talking about the geopolitical ambitions of the EU, then the first and most important test is the Western Balkans.
The mentioned global changes have already made a strong impact on the region. Some local actors hope that the erosion of the current order could open room for great ""changes"". This is primarily manifested in dangerous territorial claims.
The principle of immutability of borders is a cornerstone of European peace and security. Two years ago, Chancellor Merkel's leadership action prevented the dangerous idea of ​​exchanging territories, which would have opened Pandora's box. The infamous non-paper also showed that territorial aspirations are still alive. It is encouraging that the international community has unanimously condemned the ideas of the non-paper, identifying them as a threat to peace and the International order.
But it is worrying that some local actors, even in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have dared to openly support the non-paper ideas. And they still continue to promote them, using increasingly aggressive secessionist rhetoric. They threaten European peace and defy international law, encouraged by the crisis of the global order. This phenomenon is so dangerous that one must not be silent about it. Because, it is peace which is at stake.
If the European Union wishes to be a geopolitical entity, then it must first address these processes, which threaten peace in its immediate neighborhood. Resolute action in the EU’s own backyard is the key condition for global credibility.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
For decades now, the European perspective has been the strongest framework for strengthening peace and progress of reform in the Western Balkans. Numerous steps have been taken thanks to the hopes and desires of the countries of the region for membership in the European Union. The main reason for the raise of tensions and instability in the region is the crisis of the European perspective.
The reason behind the crisis is the increasingly frequent voice from coming from certain European Union countries, which dispute the idea of ​​enlargement. A concrete confirmation of that atmosphere is the current blockade of Northern Macedonia and Albania. After the spirit of compromise, which symbolized the Prespa Agreement, was played out, the spirit of exclusivity in the region was strengthened.
Recently, an official from Bosnia and Herzegovina, at a political forum in a European capital, stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina will never get a chance to become a member of the European Union. And then, in line with his nationalist agenda, he lashed out at the liberal values ​​of the European Union.
I don’t mention his name because it doesn’t matter. But what matters is the spirit it symbolizes. By spreading despair over Europe's future, such actors are relieving themselves of any obligation to respect democratic standards. Increasingly, they openly refuse to implement the 14 recommendations of the European Commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina. By shutting down the European perspective, the main engine of positive movement is slowly being shut down. All that remains is hopelessness and distrust, as a fertile ground for the spread of fear and hatred.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the Common Regional Market, within the Berlin Process, we support regional economic and other cooperation, but nothing can be a substitute for the perspective for the EU membership.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I do not wish to make things look better than they are: the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is dangerous and worrying. State institutions have not been functioning for several months, as Republika Srpska entity officials refuse to attend sessions. They claim that the reason for that is Inzko's Law, but that is not true.
A law banning the glorification of war criminals and the denial of crimes is a law of civilization. This is European law. European Union directives, as well as judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, clearly state that the denial of crimes and the glorification of criminals is not freedom of speech, but hate speech.
Inzko's law is not directed against any nation. It protects victims from all nations. This law prohibits the denial of genocide and other crimes established by judgments of International and domestic courts. This law prohibits the celebration of war criminals regardless of their ethnicity or any other affiliation.
Inzko's Law is not the reason for the current blockades in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is just an excuse. Republika Srpska politicians also had carried out blockades months before Inzko's law. They have been conducting them for years, finding various reasons and excuses. Yesterday, these were decisions of the Constitutional Court that were not to their liking; today it is Inzko's Law or the election of a new High Representative; there will be something else tomorrow. And the real reason and goal is always the same: to block the functioning of the state, to create the idea that he state is impossible and to demand its disbandment, in accordance with the secessionist agenda, which is not about peace and progress, but some goals from past centuries.
Esteemed Friends,
Any state, whose highest officials would not come to the sessions, would not be able to function. It is not the fault of the state, but of those officials. The only difference between European countries and Bosnia and Herzegovina is that we do not have a domestic mechanism for sanctioning such blockades.
The Dayton system envisages that the High Representative will be an instance that will determine the responsibility of officials who obstruct the work of institutions, and thus the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The process of making the position of the High Representative passive, which we have been witnessing for a long time, or its removal, which some advocate - would have fatal consequences. This would upset the Dayton balance. Numerous blocking and obstruction mechanisms would remain in the system, and the only unblocking mechanism would be removed.
The Office of the High Representative is not a precedent of any kind, but a necessary occurrence in societies where there have been serious violations of international law. In Germany and Austria, after the Second World War, there was the Allied Control Council, which had significantly greater powers than the OHR, and passed laws even, including those on the basis of which war criminals were prosecuted.
This did not prevent these countries from becoming members of the European Union and the countries that serve as an example today. On the contrary.
That Control Council was abolished after Germany united. This should be a signpost for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Once internal cohesion and functionality are achieved, Bosnia and Herzegovina will be able and have to function independently.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Building a functioning state is the biggest challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In that sense, one of the key initiatives is the one for the implementation of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, as one of the 14 priorities from the Opinion of the European Commission.
The Sejdić-Finci Ruling does not seek to increase the sense of representation of the constituent peoples in the Presidency, as some suggest. On the contrary, the European Court has found that constituent peoples already have more rights than others. It can even be said that they are privileged in relation to others. That is why the Court asked Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure equal rights for citizens who are not members of the constituent peoples.
If now, regardless of the Ruling, the condition is to further increase the sense of representation of one constituent people in the Presidency of BiH, then we are not talking about the implementation of the Strasbourg Court Ruling, but about changing the Dayton Agreement and its balance. In that case, it is then necessary to reduce the possibilities of ethnic veto in parliaments. In particular, it is necessary to reduce the House of Peoples of the Federation of BiH to the status of the Council of Peoples in RS.
The biggest frustration is not in the feeling of underrepresentation of the constituent peoples, but in the feeling of helplessness of the majority of citizens before the fact that ethnic clubs in parliament can block the adoption of any law, even those that have nothing to do with national identity or a specific issue. Specifically, in the House of Peoples of the Federation, an ethnic club has been blocking the election of a new government and the appointment of judges in the Constitutional Court for three years.
It is impossible to talk about the frustrations of any constituent people, if we do not solve the stated frustration of all citizens. It is impossible to talk about a compromise solution without taking into account the demands of all actors. It is pointless to demand the fulfillment of the demands of one political party, and to ignore all the others. Compromise is the only solution. Everything else is a dead end.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On this occasion, I would like to thank the European People's Party for consistently advocating the policy of EU enlargement.
The Western Balkans needs the European Union, but the European Union also needs the Western Balkans. Any postponement of the enlargement indefinitely or challenging the idea of the ​​enlargement - can only lead to destabilization, stagnation in reforms, and an increase in the influence of other forces in this area. This is certainly not in the interest of either the citizens of the Western Balkans or the citizens of the European Union.
That is why it is very important that we continue as strongly as possible and that we complete the process of full integration of all the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union as soon as possible. It is for important for a more peaceful and prosperous Western Balkans and for the sake of a more peaceful and prosperous European Union.
Thank you."
91538,Stateme by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina H. E. Željko Komšić at the General Debate at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly “Building resilience through ho,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91538&langTag=en-US,2021-09-22,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, The topic of this year’s debate addresses many current issues that truly present some of the key challenges to affect the future path we tread as a global society. The same is true for international and the individual politics of the countries we come from. Our determination to insist on the common values we have chosen to protect will therefore dictate the success of our common aspirations.
The COVID 19 pandemic was an important message and a lesson for us on how the existing international system can be easily shaken, but also how important the endurance and the resilience of international institutions built on multilateralism is for them to be able to respond to crisis situations. Suddenly, international relations were threatened while human rights were restricted. Multilateralism seemed to have collapsed. The gap between rich and developed countries on the one hand, and those less developed and not so rich on the other, has proven to be greater than ever in terms of access to medical equipment, medicines and vaccines. For the sake of social and economic recovery, the only thing left under those circumstances was the hope for the resilience of national economies and health systems, as well as international institutions and bodies of the United Nations, in order to combat the pandemic and find and distribute vaccines.
Still, I would also like to emphasize the importance of bilateral cooperation and assistance from neighboring or friendly countries, which in many regions, including my own, were the first concrete aid and sign of solidarity before multilateral institutions responded to crises that was the COVID 19 pandemic. That gave us hope and showed the importance of good bilateral relations. It also justified investing in regional cooperation capacities. I would now like to commend some of the numerous regional organizations from the Western Balkans that have helped sustain the economy and facilitate the flow of people and basic goods under the new circumstances. I am primarily referring to the Central European Free Trade Agreement and the South East European Regional Cooperation Council.
The pandemic has changed the world and affected the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Under the influence of new circumstances, the SDGs need to be seen in a whole new light. However, one of the most important issues of today, closely related to the goals of sustainable development as a need of global society, is finding answers to the needs of the planet.
Climate change and global warming, both visible and scientifically proven through the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are key issues that also limit the course of sustainable development. Our activities to slow global warming and combat climate change are generally not yielding the results we need to achieve by 2050, warns the 2018 special report. This year’s report repeats the same warning. Climate change is no longer a matter of warnings from the scientific community. It is a crisis situation that is already upon us. Finding answers to climate change is a costly process. It will cost even more if we do not take the need to accelerate climate change mitigation activities seriously. We have taken on that commitment because the humankind survival scenario, along with mitigating the temperature rise, is a value that we must defend at all costs. We did not choose that value. It chose us.
I believe that in the long run, this necessary response will cost the less developed and developing countries the most - the countries which still rely on energy derived from fossil fuels. As a rule, those groups of countries do not have sufficient capacity or resources to make a rapid and equitable transition to green energy sources. That will affect their ability to achieve sustainable development goals in the medium term. Therefore, financial support for the implementation of the Green Agenda is extremely important, with contributions from the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference as well as regional associations such as the European Union. In addition to the existing obligations under the Paris Agreement, the EU also establishes additional standards accepted by countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the process of stabilization and association with the European Union. In my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have about 40% of green capacity for electricity generation. However, gradual shutdown of thermal power plants, and thus most of the mines, which is expected of us in the next 25-30 years, will cause a shortage of electricity that can hardly be replaced in a timely fashion by the green energy capacity, while preserving rivers and ecological biodiversity, in accordance with international norms. Those are some of the real circumstances and challenges that we face. I believe that many other states present here face those as well. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina stands behind its promise to contribute to reduction of GHG emissions.
Mr. President,
One of the consequences of the slowdown in sustainable development that we are facing is the outflow of the working age population to developed countries. According to available statistics, almost 10% of the population has emigrated from Bosnia and Herzegovina since the last census. Mostly, the working age population. Young families with children. That is why I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the well-known wave of economic migrants from the Asian Middle East and North Africa, which my country has faced and tried to provide humanitarian aid, food and accommodation for, we are also facing an outflow of population. That will cause additional social problems to our society. Our people are leaving in search of better business and life opportunities, but also seeking security in orderly societies based on the active promotion and protection of human rights values. They go after the perspective of living in an environment where their knowledge and work can create for them a life in the certainty of a rational social order.
It is for this reason that I emphasize the protection of human rights as the next great value. That is a value that we have decided to establish already with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Europe, we also have the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, implemented under the auspices of the Council of Europe. In the European Union, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union came into effect in 2009.
Recently, however, human rights values seem to have been shaken, applied selectively, and approached on the basis of double standards. I consider such tendencies very dangerous for the preservation of the human rights protection system.
The strengthening of ethnic politics in my country, based on exclusivity and ethno-chauvinist tendencies, along with the rise of religious intolerance and the collapse of secularism in the Western Balkans region, is a matter of great concern. Given the 1992-1995 war they have been through, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are very sensitive to such social disturbances. Especially because of the genocide committed in Srebrenica, as determined by the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague and confirmed by the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
I would like to emphasize here, before you, that I come from a country considered a successful example of peace-building, but also of maintaining peace and developing institutions in the context of the United Nations mandate. The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of an international peace agreement known as the Dayton Peace Agreement. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms are also integral parts of our Constitution. Still, during the last few years, our society has been under increasing pressure of attempts to degrade basic human and civil rights and eliminate the individual, the citizen, as a subject of human rights. The complex system of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the Dayton Peace Agreement makes it difficult to reach a political consensus to move my country from the Dayton Peace Agreement that stopped the war to a functioning state with the prospect of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO in a way that accepts all the values required by democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Mr. President,
To point out the selectivity in the application of international human rights instruments, I would like to reflect on this very important segment of human rights protection from the point of view of the my country. I believe that we all share the view that the protection of human rights in all segments of society is one of the necessary conditions for the creation of stable democracies, in which peace and prosperity will prevail. However, if we consider that through the prism of the political system of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country I come from, I would like to take this opportunity to share with all of you a few important elements, which are unfortunately a part of the other, negative side of this story.
The General Framework Agreement for Peace, initialed in Dayton and signed in Paris in 1995, is in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An integral part of the Agreement, as Annex 4, is the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In its preamble, it clearly and unequivocally states that it is, among other things, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. It is clear that accession to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not impose a direct legal obligation on the acceding countries. But, it is certainly a system of values, which, among other things, aims to create a society within the countries themselves, but also beyond, based on the equality of every human being on the planet in their basic human rights.
Unfortunately, such system of values, based on the equality of all individuals within a society, does not exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I further argue that an international court, specifically the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in its five judgments against Bosnia and Herzegovina, established the existence of systemic discrimination or systemic inequality of the citizens of my country. Such inequality is reflected in several aspects of life. That includes political aspects because all citizens do not have equal rights in the electoral system, but also those where the same citizens do not have equal rights and opportunities in social life, such as the right to work. The political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is such that it gives preference to someone’s ethnicity. Based on that ethnicity, the citizens of my country have greater or lesser rights, depending on which part of the country they live in. On this occasion, I would like to remind everyone that discrimination based on a person’s ethnic origin is one of the forms of racial discrimination as set out in Item 1 of the Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination adopted by the United Nations in 1966.
The complexity of this issue is evident in the attempts to impose on us, even through diplomatic activities on the international scene, the existence of discrimination and inequality of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is done by emphasizing the ethnicity of a part of the citizens and demands for greater rights for ethnic communities supported by neighboring countries, always to the detriment of fundamental human rights. This means that collective rights, which are not part of international legal acts, are being placed above the human rights of individuals. Please allow me to state that such things are unacceptable at this moment in time.
Furthermore, diplomatic activities of various actors call for additional discrimination on ethnic grounds, in order to create an atmosphere for a process of self-determination within those ethnic communities. The ultimate goal is the dissolution or disintegration of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the annexation of parts of its territory to neighboring countries. That encourages inequality in human rights, completely devaluing and ignoring the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those same factors completely negate the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The judgments of the Tribunal stated genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and even the existence of joint criminal enterprises where it was further established that all those most heinous crimes were committed on the basis of different ethnicities of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That negates one of the fundamental human rights according to the Universal Declaration, which is the right to life.
Awards are given to the glorified war criminals, without any moral dilemmas. I consider that to be in direct contradiction with another value of the United Nations, which is the elimination of impunity for war crimes. That raises another question requiring a very clear answer - how to deal with the factors negating the courts formed by the United Nations? How to treat them in specific cases of denial of verdicts convicting the perpetrators of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing? Can such factors, which deny those verdicts and hide the perpetrators of genocide and war crimes, even be a part of the international legal order? That question directly goes back to the foundations of international law and the United Nations organization itself.
At the same time, the principles of universal jurisdiction are abused for political purposes, outside of the prescribed procedures and agreements concluded between the states that clearly specify the modalities of persecution of war crime suspects who inevitably must be held accountable. Those war crime suspects have citizenships of the countries which hold the primary responsibility for this. If universal jurisdiction is used in a selective and political way, that deeply compromises the principles of criminal law and legal security, and thus human rights. It also undermines confidence in judicial mechanisms.
On the other hand, certain politics, by means of forcing discrimination and inequality of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attempt to invade the constitutional and legal system of my country, in order to get a “Golden Key” or “Golden Share” in managing and making decisions in the country. Under all acts of international law, such as the Charter of the United Nations, they should not be allowed to do so. Their tendencies in the diplomatic field, where they deny the fundamental human rights of individuals in order to achieve their clear goals by means of certain imaginary collective rights, go beyond good neighborly relations. Such activities and intentions hide the strategic goal of appropriating parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
All those tendencies are based on the visible neglect of human rights established by a number of international acts, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Their politically dangerous goals are very much behind all this, leading to daily destabilization of the region of the Western Balkans. Such political goals are directed towards the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is evident in their efforts to force inequality among citizens on the basis of ethnicity, which, to remind you once again, is a form of racial discrimination, and the efforts to create ethnically pure territorial units. I am telling you all this to show on real examples of how the neglect of human rights and creating an environment of inequality among citizens, individuals, can have political agendas, which lead to destabilization of entire regions in the world, such as the Western Balkans. Apart from the fact that something like this is completely unacceptable, it is also very dangerous.
Mr. President,
Distinguished colleagues,
I mention this situation in my country in the context of the importance of the mechanisms of the United Nations. By means of two resolutions, the UN established the institution of the United Nations High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to take care of the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Thus the obligation of the United Nations itself to protect the international order, through the protection of acts of international law. One of those acts is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, I believe that this is the right place to emphasize the expectation that the new High Representative of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina will take into account the need to protect international legal acts and their fundamental values. That is one of his most important tasks. Otherwise, if the international community itself in Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to abandon the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, then the following question rightly arises - is the Universal Declaration even necessary if its implementation is selective? Should we even talk about the protection of human rights in general if, in the specific case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the United Nations still has an executive mandate through the Office of the High Representative, we do not show by example that we are ready to stand for common values such as protection of human rights and equality of every citizen in relation to someone else and different.
I believe that, despite all the differences of political views within Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the international community represented by the Peace Implementation Council in BiH, which assists the High Representative, the only guiding light to further political development of my country, as a pledge to preserve its peace and future, must be respect for human rights values. All the people of my country, regardless of their identity, ethnicity, religious affiliation or absence thereof, must have the same rights. Otherwise, we will end up in an “Orwellian society”, where it is accepted that some are, after all, more important than others. That always jeopardizes the stability of a society and undermines peace and security. From this very place, I call upon the United Nations institutions to insist on the values of human rights protection in every segment of their activities.
Mr. President,
Finally, I would like to express my support for the efforts of the Secretary-General, who, with the help of his services and the UN agencies, has managed to preserve the role of the United Nations in these difficult circumstances of the pandemic. Also to you, President, for your effort this year to provide a live opportunity to exchange views on current world problems reflecting also on our social activities in the countries we come from.
I believe we will next year have a General Debate under better epidemiological circumstances. That certainly requires us to promote the necessity of vaccination as the only scientifically proven way to avoid fatal consequences for human health, but also severe economic consequences for the society.
Thank you"
91361,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić at press conference during the official visit by President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91361&langTag=en-US,2021-08-28,"Mister President, esteemed members of the Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, media representatives. On behalf of the Presidency of BiH and in my personal name, I wish to express once again my pleasure to have the opportunity to talk with President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, a man who has certainly proven himself as a true friend to Bosnia and Herzegovina together with his administration and the people of the Republic of Turkey. We had very useful and honest conversations, some tete-a-tete, some as delegation meetings.
The topics certainly included those related to bilateral relations, but also wider regional relations, given the current political situation. Of course, we also touched on some current global issues.
In short, I would highlight certain topics. The agreement is that the next trilateral meeting, meaning the trilateral meeting between Bosnia and Herzegovina-Republic of Turkey-Republic of Serbia, will be held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The exact date will be defined. It is a continuation of a whole cycle of such meetings which, in general, proved to be very useful, primarily in terms of stabilization of the political situation in relations between our countries. It furthermore is useful in enabling stabilization of the whole situation in the region, especially because they are related to some specific projects. Primarily, I mean a large infrastructure project, the construction of the Sarajevo-Belgrade-Sarajevo highway, which is going at its own pace, maybe not as fast as we had expected, but still there are positive steps forward in this respect.
We also discussed the need, the opportunity, especially for Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the trade exchange between our two countries will finally reach that magical figure of 1 billion euros. Okay, dollars, euros, the exchange rate for both is similar.
We have successful economic cooperation, but there is really a lot of room for development and further improvement of economic relations. Naturally, we are aware of President Erdogan's situation regarding the state of investments, primarily of Turkish partners in BiH, problems encountered by, for example, Turkish Ziraat Bank, which wants to increase its capital, however, it cannot realise this because the Federation of BiH has not completed the process of appointing the Securities Commission.
We talked about certain specific projects when it comes to the need to bring Turkish investors, that is, the companies operating in BiH, on an equal footing with domestic companies. You will probably guess this refers to ""Natron"" in Maglaj and the former soda factory in Lukavac, that is, the supply of these companies with coal.
In addition, we discussed the intention and need for our two countries to sign a letter of intent for cooperation in the field of energy, which we consider to be vital given the situation in the energy sector and the challenges that await us in the coming years.
What I believe would be of particular interest to media in Bosnia and Herzegovina is that there was talk about internal political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I do not wish to interpret who said what, especially since all the participants are present here. Therefore, if you are interested, which I guess you are, please ask each individual what they think about it, naturally during the question time session. That would be all from me at the start. We stand at your disposal for the questions, naturally as both time and space allow. Thank you."
91355,Address by President of the Republic of Turkey Tayyip Erdoğan at the press conference at the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91355&langTag=en-US,2021-08-28,"Dear Chairman Mister Komšić, dear members Mr Džaferović and Mister Dodik, dear ministers, respected journalists and media representatives.
I would like to express my great satisfaction with the visit to Sarajevo after two years. I feel at home in this remarkable place. Bosnia and Herzegovina is in our hearts, thank you for the warm welcome.
I would also like to thank the Chairman and esteemed members of the Presidency of BiH for the hospitality they have shown us.
This year, on March 16, a joint meeting was held in Ankara, where I was the host. Later, we met in Antalya, 17-20th of June at the South East Europe Cooperation Process Summit, and this visit represents our third meeting this year. This frequency of our contacts is a concrete indicator of the value we attach to our relationships and close dialogue. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a special place in the hearts of our people.
Messages of solidarity from Bosnia and Herzegovina after the fires and floods we have faced in recent weeks, are an indication that this love of our peoples is not unrequited. On this occasion, I would like to express my great gratitude to our brothers and sisters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to the chairman and members for the messages of solidarity they sent us.
Dear media representatives, at the meeting we just held with the members of the Presidency, we focused on the work we can do in the coming period. We also talked about bilateral relations, as well as relations in the region and globally. We spoke in the field of political and economic ties that exist between our peoples. We agreed that we should speed up the implementation of this peace project.
We updated the Free Trade Agreement that we signed during the official visit of the Presidency of BiH in Ankara, in May 2019, and which entered into force on August 1, 2021. Therefore, this development will contribute to the increase of our trade and investments in BiH. But we also want to develop cooperation in the fields of industry, tourism, education, agriculture and livestock breeding. Of course, we also attach importance to strengthening our strong ties in the cultural and other fields.
Distinguished media representatives, during our meeting we exchanged views on current developments in the Balkans and we agree that we should take steps to increase economic development and, of course, prosperity in our region, for the benefit of all our peoples.
Furthermore, our goal for a billion-euro trade exchange is important and of great value. I want to say that we have confirmed our support for BiH's integration into Euro-Atlantic organisations. Territorial integrity, political unity and, of course, the sovereignty of BiH are the keys to regional peace. We will continue to work together to preserve regional stability.
Of course, on this occasion, I would like to say that at the meetings we held, we also talked today about Afghanistan. I wish to say that we are together with Afghanistan in a very short period of time. The world has moved towards another situation, towards another condition, with 170 people have already died in Afghanistan, already in this period. All this shows that developed countries have to be very careful when leaving an area. However, that was not the case in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, terrorist organizations have taken over this country. Other countries have left Afghanistan and handed it over to terrorists. It will be a great burden. ISIL has taken responsibility for this act, but who is fighting ISIL the most? Turkey fought ISIL the most. Turkey is not just doing it in words. What should we do? We need to work concretely on solving these problems, on a global level.
Now I’m talking about the Taliban. These present-day Taliban are not the old, former Taliban. So, it doesn't matter who says what, but who does what. Today, the Taliban are in Afghanistan. What they do is important. What they will do in the future is important, not what they did before. We, as Turkey, are currently focused on moving our civilians to Turkey. We have about 50 people left, technical staff. Beyond that, we have withdrawn everything, we have moved everything to our country and we hope that peace will be established in that area. We will continue to support the construction of infrastructure, as we have done to date in Afghanistan. Future developments will determine our attitudes towards the area.
Once again, allow me to express my deepest respect to this people and this country.
Thank you."
91351,Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the press conference during the official visit of President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91351&langTag=en-US,2021-08-28,"Dear President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, dear colleagues, Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Mr. Komšić and Member of the Presidency Mr. Dodik, ladies and gentlemen, journalists, dear friends, I greet you all.
Right at the beginning, I wish to say that everything Chairman of the Presidency of BiH, Mr. Komšić, and President of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, said in their introductory speeches, is what we discussed at the meetings today. There is nothing to be added and I agree with everything that has been said, but it seems customary now for us, the members of the Presidency of BiH, to make an address at press conferences.
If I evaluate the relations between the Republic of Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina, I can say that, as everyone knows, they are friendly and brotherly relations. The Republic of Turkey is a great friend of BiH, President Erdogan is a great friend of BiH. The Republic of Turkey practically does not ask anything from BiH, it only offers readiness to help BiH. We are grateful to have one such friend as the Republic of Turkey and President Erdogan, a friend to the whole of BiH, to all peoples, to all citizens in BiH. In summary, in the past three years since the current Presidency has been operating there have been numerous high level meetings, from May 2, 2019 in Ankara, then on March 16 this year in Ankara, then in July this year in Antalya, and then the meeting on July 8, 2019 here in Sarajevo, in the Presidency of BiH, when we had SEECEP. All these are meetings at the highest level.
Then we could say the following. First, the Republic of Turkey and President Erdogan are an important factor in the stability of the Western Balkans, and that is a very important fact. We also ask President Erdogan and the Republic of Turkey to continue with this policy, the stabilizing policy in the Western Balkans. The Republic of Turkey has initiatives in this context, in which it plays a part, like Bosnia and Herzegovina. These are trilateral meetings: Turkey-Serbia-BiH and Turkey-Croatia-BiH. It is very important that these trilateral meetings are revived and we plan this year, if pandemic conditions allow, to hold a trilateral meeting: the Republic of Turkey-Republic of Serbia- Bosnia and Herzegovina, here in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is on its European path, it is on its NATO path, but within that, cooperation with the Republic of Turkey and our friends, such as the Republic of Turkey, is very important. The Republic of Turkey also has its own European path, it is a member of NATO, and as we could hear from President Erdogan's speech, the Republic of Turkey supports the Euro-Atlantic path of BiH.
Another thing I would especially like to point out here are the untapped opportunities for economic cooperation.
In this convocation of the Presidency of BiH, we signed the Memorandum on May 2, 2019 in Ankara, and on March 16 this year in Ankara, the Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Infrastructure.
This agreement is vital in the construction of the Sarajevo-Belgrade highway, it is the permission of the states to start this project, which is, besides economic and infrastructural, also a very important political project. Moreover, it is a politically restabilizing project in the Western Balkans. It remains for the Parliament of Turkey to ratify the agreement and then start with concrete activities on the construction of the highway. I am in favor of starting the construction of this highway in as many places in BiH as possible, both in respect to the northern as well as the southern connection. There are interests to make it so. We expect and I have no doubt that the Republic of Turkey will offer favorable conditions to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The other thing is the Free Trade Agreement. We signed the Free Trade Agreement in May 2019 in Ankara. It has been ratified in both parliaments and there are untapped opportunities.
Turkey has given Bosnia and Herzegovina the best benefits in relation to all countries in the world when it comes to free trade. I thank the Republic of Turkey, President Erdogan for this. Still, we don't use this benefit. We have to organize ourselves to make use of this great comparative advantage for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Finally, there are companies from the Republic of Turkey that operate in BiH, large companies such as Sisajam, Hayat, Ziraat Bank, which have problems in doing business here. President Erdogan, it is up to us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help these companies, because by helping these companies, we are helping ourselves first and foremost.
Thank you once again for this visit, I wish for you to feel comfortable in BiH and of course, we will continue and intensify this cooperation.
I said at the end, I don’t like it when I say at the end, and then something important comes to me again that I didn’t say, but it really is at the end now. BiH needs peace, it needs stability, it needs the functioning of institutions, it needs a stable environment. It is in the interest of all of us in this country to move forward strongly.
I said at the end, I don’t like it when I say at the end, and then something important comes to me again that I didn’t say, but it really is at the end now. Bosnia and Herzegovina needs peace, it needs stability, it needs the functioning of institutions, it needs a stable environment. It is in the interest of all of us in this country so that we can move forward strongly.
Thank you for your attention."
91347,"Address delivered by BiH Presidency Member Milorad Dodik at the press conference on the official visit of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91347&langTag=en-US,2021-08-28,"It is always certainly an important issue that such a great statesman, great politician, great leader as President Erdoğan is among us. He is a representative of a powerful and strong country indeed. I am also glad that his visits take place continually. We have discussed important issues for a long time. I have always felt his affinity which is reflected in view of assistance to economic development, for development of infrastructure and for development of all areas that we have discussed continuously, and that is exactly what took place today, tonight, here. I just want to affirm what the President himself has said.
I do hope that we will go into detail about the fine tuning related to the building of the motorway. Details are always a problem. I believe, as I said to the President, that BiH can sustain, our economy can sustain the conditions which are usual in a commercial sense, but we do count on the position of our friends in that regard. Thus, what we need to do is to start discussion on details, on a commercial contract as I understand it, to specify it and know the way we will proceed. This is a historic, infrastructure project, which is the result of both willingness and wish of President Erdoğan to support exactly both the development and connectedness in the Balkans in this way.
Of course, we also discussed some other important political issues. I presented to President Erdoğan the facts related to the political situation and the internal situation here in BiH. Afghanistan shows best that foreigners can introduce order in a country and maintain it. We believe in internal agreement only, which is always necessary on each issue because that is the best way. Further, I stated here, and I want to re-affirm that position in public hereafter that we do believe in cooperation with President Erdoğan more than with some other failed attempts conducted here in BiH, aimed at imposing some solutions. I am convinced, therefore, that, if Turkey were included in the story about the so-called promotion related to High Representative, the current travesty would not have taken place, and that, in view of it, it is absolutely clear that no high representative exists here. There is a certain person who has been trying to present himself like that. That is my position, I am stating it here tonight, fully convinced of the fact that President Erdoğan understands it very well, and he has proven to be a man who listens to all of us. Of course, he has got his own positions.
Therefore, in that sense, it is definitely not good for BiH that any non-elected foreigner shows up here, who, moreover, presents and introduces himself as high representative, in order to impose laws onto us here. This is not a civilizational achievement, some old history remembers it, and in that sense, we cannot accept that a non-elected foreigner passes laws here for us. Again, I will re-iterate that it is best for us here in BiH to do that, with a friend such as Erdoğan, President Erdoğan. I am ready for such a dialogue, and I am ready for us to accept good services from President Erdoğan in that sense. And, this is not disputable. Furthermore, I also stated at the meeting that we cannot accept the arrival of someone who is elected by some Peace Implementation Council, which is a self-elected body, which is not a part of the Dayton Agreement, and that such person takes over decision making on our behalf. That is not what I am elected for. The people elected me, and my people elected me to represent them, and it would certainly not be right for me to accept that any foreigner who does not have a mandate of the international factor, first of all of the Security Council, can do anything here, and the previous one, any one of them, to be able to impose laws because he himself remembered that he should do that.
Therefore, I call for an agreement, I call for discussions, and I invite friends to help us in creating these. I invite the people from Sarajevo to show understanding and comprehend the seriousness of this situation, that is what I discussed here. And what is important indeed is that we preserve peace here, and regardless of the development of political relations, problems, crises or solutions, the peace is ultimate here and it must be maintained. It depends only on us in BiH how things will develop in BiH. And do not let the experience of Afghanistan here in BiH, when the foreigners leave this country, turn out to be a warning which we did not take into consideration. Therefore, give me an agreement, I want an agreement. President Erdoğan, I am ready to discuss all possible issues with you, and with others in BiH. And I think that everything should be on the agenda. I am for maintaining the territorial integrity of BiH, whereas the political arrangement must be inside, as we agree on. The Dayton Agreement has almost ceased to exist because it has been destroyed by the interventions of the international community, and it is, in that sense, I think, that we have to reach a new agreement which can stabilize Bosnia in the following few decades. If we fail to do this, still preserve peace, but also, and I also said it here regardless that it was not pleasant for some ears, that any decision to be or solution to be, it has to be a peaceful one, even if it is a dissolution in BiH. I hereby call for a constant dialogue, of course with the assistance provided by our friends.
I hereby thank the President for having patience to listen to our problems, and only friends can do that. And thank you for explicitness, readiness to help in the area of economics, and I am sorry that our economic cooperation and trade are not much better at this moment."
91297,Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the opening of the Memorial to the shaheeds and fallen soldiers of Stolac Municipality,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91297&langTag=en-US,2021-08-22,"Dear soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, respected families of the shaheeds and fallen soldiers, representatives of the Veterans' Associations, respected members of the Organizing Committee for erecting a memorial to the shaheeds and fallen soldiers of Stolac Municipality, representatives of legislative and executive governments at all levels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, eminence, citizens of Stolac, dear attendees!
Allow me to begin by thanking the leadership of the ""Unified Union of Veterans, Union of Veterans of Stolac Municipality"" for their determination and efforts to preserve the memory of the heroic path of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the achievements of the 1992-1995 liberation war.
The unveiling of the monument to the shaheeds and fallen soldiers of this area is another confirmation of such efforts, which should be to the honor of each of your members, but also of all of us.
Stolac is a special place. The crossroads of cultures. From the medieval Bosnian state, through Ottoman Bosnia and Stolac waqif Ali-pasha Stočević, anti-fascism to the heroic defense during the last aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Defiance and humanity, that is what connects all these epochs and all the people of this region. That is why the invitation to today's event represents a particular honor to me.
Dear soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
First, I wish to address you, but also the families of the shaheeds and fallen soldiers who laid down their lives for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our homeland.
Today, you are unveiling a memorial to your comrades-in-arms, with the desire that the goals of your struggle remain permanently recorded. We must not forget them. We must not forget their sacrifice and the most turbulent times for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
You have won a battle that was not just a defense of human lives and territory, but a battle for the very being and idea of this country. The battle for democracy and equity. For the possibility for people of different faiths and nations to continue to live together. And that is the most valuable thing for which one should stand up and fight.
You defended and preserved it.
And no one can take that away from you.
Dear citizens of Stolac,
These days, you are also marking 28 years since the expulsion of 8,000 of your fellow citizens from Stolac, of which 3,000 ended up in the ""Kostana bolnica"" concentration camp. The survivors of the camp and the families of the victims are returning to convey and thus preserve the truth about the crimes committed. During the war, this building of terror was the seat of the HVO Military Police which today is awarded by the President of the Republic of Croatia with the highest order of that country.
What was the fault of your fellow citizens? What was your fault? What was the guilt of every innocent victim killed in the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina? That we have remained consistent with the fundamental principles of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a community of diversity, not seeking this country only for ourselves, excluding or defying that right to others.
There lies the essence of all conflicts, from medieval Bosnia to the last aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. These facts should be repeated, persistently and devotedly. Let us never again forget why we have been exposed to the violence and injustice by our neighbors for centuries.
Dear friends,
The unique multiethnic culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is woven in a thousand years of tolerance and respect among citizens, regardless of their ethnicity and religion.
The necropolis of Radimlja's stećak tombstones, here in Stolac, is a pearl of Bosnia and Herzegovina's and world cultural heritage, but also a testimony to a single, unique Bosnia and Herzegovina that no one has ever managed to divide.
The intention of the perpetrators of genocide and joint criminal enterprise was to destroy the multiethnic fabric of our society through mass slaughter, torture, rape, expulsion, and looting.
Their followers still dream of completing the political project of Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, Franjo Tuđman, Gojko Šušak and Mate Boban, that brought bloodshed to the entire region.
They, almost on daily basis, threaten with the secession of part of Bosnia and Herzegovina or they abuse the Dayton Constitution with various blockades to force us to agree to a policy of division, a policy of exclusivity and inequality for all citizens. We will not accept that.
The highest officials of Serbia and Croatia come to parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina sending bad and irresponsible messages. Recently, right here, in Stolac, at Radimlja, a high-ranking official commemorated the Bleiburg victims. It is not clear to anyone what kind of relationship Radimlja, the good Bosnians, Stolac and Bleiburg are in. But where does the right of anyone to abuse this place come from? Where does the right of anyone over the monuments of the world cultural heritage, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to evoke memories of Bleiburg come from? Stop doing that.
It is truly surprising that the leadership and leading institutions of the Republic of Croatia allow themselves something like this. A country that is a member of the European Union should not do that primarily for the sake of its citizens and their future. It is time for the Republic of Croatia to think seriously about this.
The Republic of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are turned towards each other. This will remain so. The importance of good relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina goes beyond the importance of open issues. But then why does the Republic of Croatia refuse to resolve open issues with Bosnia and Herzegovina? It is not good for a state to illegally exploit the good of its neighbors. It is not good for its top leadership to openly side with one political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the one that supports and encourages the secessionism of Dodik's SNSD. The leadership of the Republic of Croatia needs to think seriously about all this. Good relations between our two countries also relax the relations between Bosniaks and Croats in BiH.
I wish to stress this in particular:
Stolac does not exclusively belong to anyone, nor does any place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Every part of Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs equally to all citizens. Stolac is a city of all Bosnians and Herzegovinians to whom the wellbeing of this country is in their hearts.
Those who think differently, who under the motto of legitimacy seek to maintain and deepen divisions in our society, I tell them from this place: you will not achieve that. Because no one wants such a Bosnia and Herzegovina anymore. Most of our citizens want a modern, democratic, European state in which all citizens will have equal rights. The European Union does not want that anymore. The messages of European officials are clear and unequivocal and reject the policy of divisions and ethnic exclusivity.
Dear friends!
Someone once nicely said: If you wish Bosnia and Herzegovina well, just leave it alone. Bosnians and Herzegovinians will find their own way, just as was the case before. This particularly relates to BiH's neighbors.
Those who wish better relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to face the truth, prevent the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country from being brought into question, stop insulting victims and survivors of genocide and joint criminal enterprise, and deny court-confirmed historical facts. They have recently been obliged to do so by the Amendments to the Criminal Law of BiH, which prohibit the denial of genocide and other war crimes and the glorification of war criminals, for which, during the mandate to this date, this Presidency Member has persistently called. It has been proven I was right.
You cannot receive and reward The Hague convicts for crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, come to Bosnia and Herzegovina like it was your province, bypass the official highest institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina by visiting parts of another entity or only cantons with a majority of one people. That is not how friendship is made with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is my message to them: Take a lesson from the words of the great Miroslav Krleža. Krleža devoted some of his most beautiful sentences and thoughts to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
“Lady Europe might pardon us, but only Bosnia has its monuments. The Stećci. What is a Stećak?
That is the personification of a highlander Bosnian! What is a Bosnian doing on the Stećak? Standing erect! His head and arm lifted high! But nowhere, nowhere, nobody has ever found a Stećak with a Bosnian kneeling or begging or one in which he appears as a slave...”
Dear friends,
Nonetheless, Bosnia and Herzegovina's progress can no longer be stopped. Most of our citizens want peace, stability, and prosperity, they want to build a common and secure future for themselves and their children.
Time is on the side of those who love our country, who work for its progress and who want to see it safe and prosperous, as a member of the European Union and NATO. And we will make it happen. There is no longer any doubt about that.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will gradually return to what it has always been - a place where people of different religions, cultures and identities live together in security and prosperity. Yet, with a bitter experience which does not allow oblivion and tragic mistakes leading to a new genocide or joint criminal enterprise. Rest assured.
Thank you."
91250,"Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the “Freedom Days of the Knightly City of Bužim""",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91250&langTag=en-US,2021-08-15,"Respected fighters of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 505th Bužim Knight Brigade, respected relatives of martyrs and fallen fighters, representatives of veterans' associations, respected members of the Organizing Committee of the event ""Freedom Days of the Knightly City of Bužim"", citizens of Bužim, dear attendees,
At the beginning, let me express my gratitude to the management and members of the Organizing Committee of the event ""Freedom Days of the Knightly City of Bužim"" for perseverance in organizing this important event, but also for the efforts to preserve the memory of the heroic path of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the goals we fought for.
Also, I take this opportunity to congratulate all members of the 505th Knights Brigade on the 29th anniversary of the founding and beginning of the heroic journey.
It is a special honour to be in the knightly city of Bužim today. Here, freedom, honour, pride and homeland are the most important words. White martyr's tombstones are the clearest testimony of your struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina, freedom and dignity.
Furthermore, I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate the 29th anniversary to all 505th Bužim Knight Brigade members.
Dear friends,
When looking for answers and explanations in the first post-war days about how we managed to defend the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our president and commander-in-chief, the late Alija Izetbegović, said: the secret was somewhere in the souls or character of the people."" The unconquered Krajina and the unwavering strength of the Krajina fighters are the most prominent examples of this miracle.
Our heroic resistance rests on the sacrifice of those who were willing to rise up against evil and injustice at the cost of life and to oppose the far superior force of the aggressor.
Only such determination, the determination of the people who defend the right to survival and the citizens who defend the right to freedom and equality, can bear fruit. Such resistance cannot be broken.
We will never forget the goals we fought for. Those who think we will are mistaken. There is no forgetting! We will remember both good and evil, that time of the most difficult temptation for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heroism of the best BiH sons in the 1992-1995 defence-liberation war, our martyrs and fallen fighters.
The Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, led by the late President Alija Izetbegović, and the people organized into units of the Army of the Republic of BiH achieved a historic goal: they defended and preserved the entire sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And no one can dispute this historical fact, no matter how hard they try.
That victory was not only military, but also civilizational. We managed to gain democracy. We have defended the idea and being of this country, what we carry as a lasting testament from our ancestors. The ability for people of different faiths and nations to still live together. And that's a lot.
Dear friends,
In a summarized history and description of this area, it should be said that this is the area of brave and defiant people, diligent and noble Krajišniks whose loyalty and devotion this country has never doubted. The latest aggression against the statehood and integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most recent testimony to the sacrifice that the citizens of Bužim and the entire Krajina were ready to make.
In a complete political, informational and economic blockade, in an extremely difficult and complex military-political situation, thanks to members of the 5th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the belief that we will preserve the integrity of this country was defended.
In the most difficult moments of the struggle for the survival of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 505th Bužim Knight Brigade gave its best sons. 497 of them. Among them was the late General Izet Nanić, the golden lily and the hero of the defence-liberation war. During the most difficult moments for Krajina and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Nanić believed in its survival and the victory of the unity of all peoples who have this country at heart.
In the words of the late Izet Nanić: ""God willing, Bosnia and Herzegovina will be ours"", the essence of the efforts of all true patriots is summed up, in whose hearts the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina occupies the main place. Preserving its integrity, independence, and autonomy, preserving our centuries-old hearths, were the goals of our struggle and we achieved those goals.
We will forever remember General Izet Nanić. We will remember our fathers, brothers and sons who laid down their lives for the freedom we have today. With the depth of the tragedy that has befallen us, we can measure our obligation towards future generations, with the goal of preserving peace and prevent evil from happening ever again.
The struggles ahead of us are just as crucial as those behind us. It is our obligation to complete the building of the state for which the best among us gave their lives.
Dear soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
While preparing this speech, I thought: what else can we say to the people who, in the most crucial moments of the defence of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, were on the front lines as the strongest link of resistance?
For the past 29 years, it’s as if we’ve spent big words wanting to show how sincere your fight was, how great that courage was, and how much our victory was deserved in the end.
We must not tire. No forgetting! In each subsequent temptation, we draw our strength from that memory, from the memories of the heroes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is why they must be woven into every paragraph, into every detail, into every step forward that we make.
That is why we will repeat and remind and look again for words to say that the best among us were members of the 505th Bužim Knight Brigade. All the nations that have transformed their struggle into a healthy and functional state have built it on the heritage of values won by people like you.
It is up to us and the generations to come to preserve the truth about your just struggle and not allow that truth to be ever endangered by deliberate distortion of historical facts.
Dear friends,
Unfortunately, there are still those who impudently attack the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, question its sustainability, threaten divisions, undermine its institutions and international subjectivity, and try to nullify the progress we have painstakingly achieved through joint efforts.
The ideological and political followers of those who are the main organizers of the genocide hinder our progress towards full stability, prosperity and membership in the European Union and NATO.
Special mention should be made of the increasingly frequent and aggressive denial of genocide and glorification of war criminals, followed by shameful awards given by the institutions of the Republika Srpska entity, in front of international and national public.
But the end of that destructive adventure seems to be near. No one wants to open new wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina anymore. The ideological and political followers of the organizers of the genocide are slowly being left alone.
All major international factors resolutely oppose such destructive policies. Our persistent action and pointing out the perniciousness of such a policy, at home and abroad, has helped to set in motion a new determination that we are witnessing.
During my term as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I have clearly warned and called on international officials to stop such actions and point to its disastrous impact on positive processes in BiH, and the urgency and necessity of passing a law that would permanently stop it.
Amendments to the BiH Criminal Code, which prohibit the denial of genocide and other war crimes and the glorification of war criminals, confirm that the international community has realized this.
I think the time has come for the heirs of the policies of Milošević, Karadžić and Mladić, Boban and the like to understand that those who wanted to see the end of Bosnia and Herzegovina ended up in the dustbin of history. History will not have much to say about Milošević, Karadžić and Mladić, except for what is already recorded in the annals of The Hague tribunal, and Tudjman's political and military adventure received an epilogue and its real name: ""joint criminal enterprise"". That is how they ended and that is how everyone who dares to touch Bosnia and Herzegovina will end.
You can be assured of that.
Dear friends,
Allow me to highlight the following at the very end: It is our obligation to complete the building of the state for which the best among us have given their lives. The challenges of integration into the European Union and NATO are great, but it is a future that will bring us lasting peace and a better life for our children. Let's forget about ideological divisions, party or personal interests, because the interest of the state is above all those individual interests.
We will only succeed if we create an environment in which young people will remain to live with dignity from their work and start families, because that is the only guarantee of the future. We need to keep this in mind every day and work diligently on that goal.
Thank you."
91207,"Address delivered by Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovin at Defence of BiH - Igman 2021 event",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=91207&langTag=en-US,2021-08-04,"Esteemed families of the fallen soldiers and shahids, disabled ex-soldiers, veterans of the Army and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of BiH, defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, my fellow combatants,
Another anniversary is marked these days of the heroic resistance of the defenders of the City of Sarajevo and the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are marking it in the area of Igman, which was a strategically important point in the overall defense of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Before I say anything else, let me, again, underline an infinite debt that all of us have to the defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina who gave their lives for the homeland here in the area of Igman. No speech about the defense of Igman, Sarajevo, or the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina is possible without referring to them.
During the aggression against the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, over eleven thousand civilians, including 1,601 children, were killed in Sarajevo by the chetnik aggressor. I dare not imagine what would have happened if some key defense points, like Igman, important for both the city and the State, were not defended. Without doubt, it is clear now that another Srebrenica would have happened. Such outcome was prevented thanks only to those who were ready to fight and risk their own lives for the lives of all of us. The aggressors’ terror was not yielded to and that is why we now have a privilege to enjoy our freedom.
No freedom was intended for the citizens of Sarajevo. They were meant to be destroyed. The State itself was meant to be destroyed, too. This is best seen from the intensity of aggressors’ actions during the so-called negotiations. In principle, this city was always hit by the greater number of shells at such times when the representatives of the legitimate authorities of the Republic of BiH were forced to sit at the same table and negotiate with the rebels and criminals. It was by killing the children of this city that they wanted to force us to give up the State.
Therefore, no one has the right today to give up the State. No one is afraid any longer from the threatening statements made by the politicians who award war criminals, glorify war crimes, or reject the law on banning genocide denial. They did not defeat us by their tanks, planes or the plethora of weapons they had at their disposal at the time. Therefore, they should know that their current statements and hollow noise do not frighten anyone any more.
We do not live in 1992 or in 1995 any longer, and we do not live in an illusion that there is a possibility of a repentance for the crimes committed. Therefore, we can send a message to them on this occasion that they can say whatever they want, we are not even interested any more in their opinion about the State. However, they will never again repeat what they did almost three decades ago. This is not my belief only, but the belief of all individuals who perceive Bosnia and Herzegovina as their homeland, and there is a majority of us who do so. The intensity of our love for it is stronger than the intensity of hatred of those who hate it. Those who are not with us today share such love for this State, too. Thank you, again."

First of all, let me extend my gratitude to the management of the Sarajevo Canton’s Memorial Fund, and to the members of the Organizational Board of “Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina – Igman 2021” event for organizing today’s academy, as well as for their efforts invested in accomplishing their mission through acting as dedicated followers of the achievements of the defensive and liberating war conducted between 1992 and 1995. I am deeply honored to be a patron of the present event.
Dear friends,
We remember today one of the most important defensive battles for both Sarajevo and our State of Bosnia and Herzegovina: the battle of Igman, one of the greatest military victories won by the heroes of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That miraculous victory was made by our courageous soldiers and officers, and by our politicians led by the war Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the commander in chief Alija Izetbegović. The victory was based on the righteous aims and universal civilizational values, refined and strengthened by the Bosnian spirit.
Igman is, perhaps, the truest reflection of our resistance. We were attacked from all sides; the aggressor was convinced that breaking down our resistance was just a matter of time. But, we did not surrender or give up. The soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina provided an unexpected resistance. Contrary to all expectations and military logic, that resistance kept growing constantly after the Igman victory. After that victory, the Army grew into a superior and victorious military force. We defended and preserved our homeland, restored its statehood, won peace, albeit unfair, but without which there could not have been any reconstruction or revival.
Let me underline this in particular: that struggle was honorable. In the conflict which was imposed on us we had the strength not only to defend ourselves but also to restrain hatred. The fundamental difference between you and the aggressors lies in restraining hatred. They wanted single-nationalism and single-mindedness. You fought for democracy and multiethnicism, for a possibility that people of different faiths and nations continue to live together. You defended the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That makes up your identity card, the ID card of each single one of you. You can and should be proud of it.
Dear soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Now, twenty-eight years later, we live in the time of challenging political and economic reforms that we must implement on our path to the European Union and NATO. It may seem sometimes that in the arduous daily political situations, within the difficult political efforts we invest, under the heavy burden of obligations and pressure we are exposed to, we forget how expensive each particle of Bosnia and Herzegovina which you defended is.
But, let me assure you that we will not get tired, we will not agree to live in oblivion. We will not do that because of each Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s soldier whom we lost. We will not do that because of each fallen innocent victim. We do not have the right to live in oblivion or to lenience that may lead to relativization of the truth about our struggle.
We will not and we cannot forget our fathers, brothers or sons who gave their lives for freedom which we enjoy today, for the homeland that we keep improving and in which there should never again be room for uncertainty or repetition of suffering that we went through in the past.
It is upon us and the future generations to preserve the truth on your righteous struggle and not to allow the truth to ever be jeopardized by deliberate twisting of the historical facts.
Dear friends,
Unfortunately, there are still those who attack sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country, while disputing its sustainability, threatening by divisions, undermining its institutions and international subjectivity, trying to undo the progress which we have achieved together by our joint arduous efforts.
The ideological and political followers of those who were the main organizers of genocide have obstructed our progress towards full stability, prosperity and membership in the European Union and NATO.
We should particularly highlight ever more frequent and aggressive instances of genocide denial and glorification of war criminals, and the shameful awarding of the war criminals by the legitimate state institutions of the Republika Srpska entity, before the very eyes of both domestic and international publics.
They still dream about completion of the political project of Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, which turned out to be catastrophic for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole region alike. We must oppose such dangerous and irresponsible recklessness by strengthening our collective determination to stop opening new wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Such attitude was also established by the Peace Implementation Council members in Bosnia and Herzegovina - they realized that their silence and appeasement in the face of such aggressive actions was sending a dangerous message: that it was acceptable, and that there were no subsequent sanctions. In my few previous addresses, I clearly warmed about a detrimental impact of such attitudes to the positive processes in BiH, as well as about both urgency and necessity of passing a law which would put a permanent end to such unacceptable attitudes. The changes of the Criminal Law of BiH, by which denial of genocide and other war crimes and glorification of war criminals are banned now, confirm that we were right. Therefore, I am even more convinced that the forces of destruction will be defeated and that in the times ahead of us the forces that love this country and work for its progress will keep growing.
The progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina is unstoppable now, which has gradually become obvious to all.
Thank you."
90986,"Address by the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Šefik Džaferović at the presentation of the project ""Museum of Genocide"", 10th of July, 2021",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=90986&langTag=en-US,2021-07-10,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, Dear friends, It is a great honour to be with you here today, on the occasion of the completion of one and the beginning of another important project for the Memorial Centre in Potočari. The completion of the works on the renovation of the roof in the Battery Factory and the presentation of the project ""Museum of Genocide"" are extremely important events for the memorial culture.
Tomorrow we will mark another sad anniversary at this same place. It’s been 26 years and the wounds are still open. When it comes to genocide, time does not pass in the same way as with other things. Sometimes one gets the impression that time does not even pass, because the pain remains the same, the memories do not fade.
And yet, time passes relentlessly. There are fewer and fewer living witnesses of the genocide every year. The memory does not fade, but in the end, it disappears with the death of the people who carried it deep within themselves. That is why it is of great importance to preserve that memory, using forms of memorial culture, so that the new generations, who were born after the war, would know what happened and learn important lessons for the future.
The key role in preserving the memory of genocide and turning it into remembrance is played by the institutions that focus on this matter. I am referring to the Srebrenica-Potočari Memorial Center first and foremost. There are many museums, institutions, memorial rooms and landmarks throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world. There is an increasing number each year. However, the Memorial Center is the key institution when it comes to memorial culture and remembrance. First of all, because this is where the bloody butchery began in July 1995; because there is a cemetery for genocide victims at this place, and because this is an institution of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In recent period, the memorial centre was, as is currently, the institution of irreplaceable significance in preserving and protecting the truth about genocide. It will have an even greater significance and responsibility in the future when there will no longer be funerals here in Potočari. Funerals and burials of genocide victims are a key event of each anniversary. One day, when there will be no more funerals, all attention will be focused on the contents that the Memorial Centre will be able to offer.
That is why it is essential that this institution receives full financial and any other support. The mission and responsibility of the Memorial Centre bears a heavy weight that is impossible to be fulfilled without adequate support.
The state of Bosnia and Herzegovina stands and will always stand behind the Memorial Centre. This institution operates on the basis of funds provided by the state and this is extremely important. At the same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not in a position to support the work of the Memorial Centre even more, due to the burden of the Dayton structure, which is best illustrated by the fact that the Council of Ministers did not declare 11th of July a Day of Mourning in Bosnia and Herzegovina because the ministers from the entity of Republika Srpska were against it.
Although our hands are tied, our obligation is to continue to fight and find ways, how, despite all the obstructions, the Memorial Centre can continue to work and develop. As a member of the collective head of state, in the past I have insisted that support from lower levels be much greater, and I am glad to see that a significant step forward has been made in this field.
Another source of financial support, in this situation, are our friends from around the world. The Republic of Turkey is among the most generous donors of the Memorial Centre, which today’s event also confirms. Therefore, in the presence of the Deputy Minister of Culture of the Republic of Turkey, I would like to thank for everything that the government of the Republic of Turkey, led by President Erdogan, are doing when it comes to protecting the truth about the genocide in Srebrenica. Please convey my gratitude to the President of the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people.
The leaking roof has been a symbol of the neglect of the Memorial Centre for years. The previous management and employees did their best, but a thorough action was needed to make a breakthrough. I have no doubt that through the appointment of the new management, led by Director Emir Suljagić and the Chairman of the Management Board Ševket Hafizović, the necessary momentum and synergy have been achieved, thanks to which steady steps forward have already been made. I can say that the Memorial Centre will always have my support, and that I will protect the interests and strengthen the position of this institution wherever I go, as much as I can as a member of the Presidency.
Thank you."
89923,Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the official ceremony of opening the “Alija Izetbegović” square in Bužim,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=89923&langTag=en-US,2021-02-20,"Dear mother of the hero of the defensive-liberation war, the late Izet Nanić,
Dear families of our martyrs, families of the fallen soldiers, war veteran invalids, demobilized veterans, esteemed officials from all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina, my dear citizens of Bužim,
It is a great honour for me to be here today in this heroic city, the heroic Bužim, that showed everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the world what the homeland means and how the homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina is defended. We are all grateful to you for that and we will remain forever grateful.
Thank you for naming this beautiful place, the square, after the late President Alija Izetbegović.
The late President Alija Izetbegović is the most significant figure in the modern history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will forever remain inscribed that he was at the head of Bosnia and Herzegovina and led Bosnia and Herzegovina during the hardest time of her history. Under his leadership, our Bosnia and Herzegovina broke away from the jaws of great state policies and became an independent state, a subject of international law. This was a historical endeavor that rarely happens in history.
Alija Izetbegović led Bosnia and Herzegovina and was at the head of the forces that ensured the independence of this country. After the aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović led all patriotic forces in the defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina was defended. That is why Alija Izetbegović is the most important person in the modern history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Alija Izetbegović was a statesman in a true sense of the word. He was a thinker, a humanist and a democrat. We will always remember our late President Alija Izetbegović. And this is one of the ways in which we remember him.
Thank you, dear people of Bužim, for recognizing this and for naming this square after the late President Alija Izetbegović.
Dear friends, we are here today to mark the completion of the construction of one, not large but for this area very big and very important project.
I wish to have as many as possible such and similar projects, especially those related to development, education, health, economy, in Bužim as well as in the entire Una-Sana Canton and in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
89864,Address by BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović at the ceremony marking the 44th anniversary of the University “Džemal Bijedić” in Mostar,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=89864&langTag=en-US,2021-02-11,"Dear Rector of the “Džemal Bijedić” University, Dear Chairman of the Rector’s Conference in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Deans and leaders of university studies, Dear Mufti Dedović, Representatives of legislative and executive government, Dear students, Your excellences, ladies and gentlemen,
It is an honour and a pleasure to be here with you today.
At the very beginning, I would like to express my gratitude to the management of the University ""Džemal Bijedić"" to date, who managed to preserve and affirm this institution and its role and importance in the society of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Only true commitment to the values and ideals of science and education, but also commitment to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, could carry out these 44 years of dedicated work. And I congratulate you on that.
I commend Rector Zlomušica and his closest associates for the organization of today's ceremony. I extend my most sincere congratulations to the winners of the ""Džemal Bijedić"" University award. I extend my deepest expressions of respect to the citizens who lost their loved ones during this plague of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
one of the most important tasks in the time ahead in Bosnia and Herzegovina is to ensure access to quality education. Lagging behind developed countries is directly related to falling behind in the field of education, especially in the field of science and modern innovation. Education, science and culture are the pillars of every advanced community. Lack of quality education leads to prejudice and encourages xenophobia and hatred. Our approach to addressing these challenges therefore needs to be comprehensive and coordinated.
In more than four decades, despite numerous challenges especially in the war and post-war period, the “Džemal Bijedić“ University has managed to preserve and affirm its role in the Bosnian-Herzegovinian scientific and educational community, which was particularly hard hit during the last aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is noteworthy to mention that the University ""Džemal Bijedić"" in Mostar did not operate only in the service of education, but it also to a large extent educated young people in the spirit of our tradition which requires us to respect our history, origin and diversity of our cultural space.
It is of particular importance that future generations continue to develop in that spirit, and in the spirit of the scientists and educators who have attended this important institution.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Sustainable and systematic investment in quality education is one of the best ways to create and improve opportunities for young people who have huge potential for any society. If well educated, they are usually the main generator of stability and prosperity. We should do everything in our power to make quality education available to everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, today in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are examples where young people are fighting for their basic human rights, mostly in the Republika Srpska entity. In schools, classes in the Bosnian language have been abolished and this practice continues and is met with silence by a significant part of the national and international public.
The ideologies that led to bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia at the end of the last century have not been completely defeated.
We need to be aware of that. The battle between those who seek to preserve the pluralistic character and tolerant spirit of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian society and those who provoke, incite and deepen cultural, ethnic and religious divisions is not over.
We must not allow the idea of cultural pluralism to be more seriously jeopardized. We must continue to fight for equality until every person in Bosnia and Herzegovina is guaranteed equal rights.
Throughout its history, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have paid a high price by protecting their pluralistic society and identity. But regardless of that price, we have never given up on those fundamental principles. And we shall not.
Many of you remember the sad moment on November 9, 1993, when the Old Bridge in Mostar was demolished. But I’m sure you also remember July 23, 2004, when we jointly marked the opening of the restored Old Bridge. That event stands as a valuable testimony to the resilience of the spirit of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the determination of our people to rebuild and reconnect.
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
The goal of education is acquisition of knowledge. Diplomas that students receive at the end of a certain cycle of education certify the acquired knowledge.
I wish the staff and students of the University ""Džemal Bijedić"" to continue in the same spirit as before and to achieve even better results. I firmly believe that the future of this institution is bright and secure.
Thank you!"
89460,The address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić on the 15th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=89460&langTag=en-US,2020-12-01,"Dear excellences, soldiers, NCOs, officers, generals, dear guests! It is my honour to, on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and in my own name, I can address you on the 15th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With the adoption of the Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina 15 years ago, the process of establishing professional armed forces began.
These regulations enabled the formation of armed forces inclusive of everyone, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, conditioned only by their professional ability to withstand the challenges required by being part of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our soldiers have shown their ability for the greatest challenges within the UN and NATO peace missions, where they have participated in very complex and demanding tasks, resulting in receiving high commendations in these supranational organizations
We should be especially proud to point out the adoption of the Reform Program of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a continuation of activities from 2009, when our country officially requested inclusion in the NATO MAP programme, i.e. the NATO Membership Action Plan.
A year later in Tallinn, NATO approved Bosnia and Herzegovina's participation in the MAP, albeit on condition that Bosnia and Herzegovina registers the military property as state property. Despite this, the North Atlantic Council, as the NATO decision-making body approved full participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in MAP on 5th December 2018, inviting our country to submit its first Annual National Programme.
We did this by submitting a Reform Programme, which contains all five chapters, with the structure and elements, as NATO requires of all MAP participants. On that occasion, we managed to ""unlock"" the activities on the reform of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are related to modernization and staffing according to NATO standards, so that our Armed Forces would be improved with better organization and equipment.
On this occasion, I would like to congratulate the Armed Forces of BiH and the Ministry of Defence of BiH on fulfilling over 70% of the activities from the Reform Program of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the difficult circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Fulfillment of these activities enables our country to submit the next Reform Program, which we will submit to the NATO headquarters in the coming period.
This two-way communication process is very important for Bosnia and Herzegovina, because apart from the military part, fulfilling the NATO criteria means establishing the rule of law, protection of human rights of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the individual level, judicial reform, increased transparency and the fight against organized crime and corruption.
All these processes are complementary to the reforms required to receive a candidate status in the European Union, followed by opening negotiation chapters within the new methodology for accepting new members into the European Union.
These parallel processes have a number of common elements. Therefore, when we see that there are state institutions that can fulfil 70% of the planned tasks in one year, it gives me the right to believe that we can continue to meet other criteria relatively quickly and gain legitimacy for membership in the European Union and NATO. Such a thing would be crucial for Bosnia and Herzegovina
The recent bilateral military exercise at Glamoč, held in cooperation with the military forces of the friendly forces of the United States of America, also contributed to the successful participation in multilateral military exercises.
The activities of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a good indicator that we know how to work, that we have professional staff who know how to do their job, so allow me to express my sincere congratulations.
Despite a number of difficulties, primarily in financial terms, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have made continuous progress. They prove to be a guarantor of state stability and protection of the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I firmly believe that you will continue to perform your tasks successfully both in the country and abroad to the pride and joy of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina
I wish all members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina a happy Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
89451,"Address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at Bobovac at the marking of 25 November, the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=89451&langTag=en-US,2020-11-25,"Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Today we mark the seventy-seventh anniversary of the restoration of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is, the anniversary of the First Session of the Anti-Fascist People's Liberation Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I said in press statements yesterday, and I will repeat it here today. The work of restoring the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was in fact the work of an exceptional generation of people. People who, overcoming ideological, political and ethnic differences, had enough wisdom, which we often lack today, to find what is in their common interest. And that common interest is the state.
We could be talking here for hours about the contribution by people like Rodoljub Čolaković, Vojislav Kecmanović, Avdo Humo, Sulejman Filipović and many others. We would still not be able to say everything about them and many other heroes and anti-fascists. Let history speak of them and let books be written about them, as the French do when they write about the leaders of the French Revolution.
Today, we visited several memorials, those from the period of remembrance of the national liberation struggle, and memorials related to the period of the last aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. The names of heroes and innocent victims who gave their lives for Bosnia and Herzegovina are woven on all these monuments.
I often stay looking at the names of the victims written on Vraca Memorial and on the Sarajevo Memorial for Children Killed during Seige. And I wonder, what were these children guilty of to the criminals. No answer. Apart from the realization that they were killed by the same ideology, the ideology of fascism, hatred and evil.
Despite all this, despite these painful facts, Bosnia and Herzegovina was not killed, nor was the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina killed. Bosnia and Herzegovina lives through the younger generations, who love their homeland and want to make their homeland a prosperous and secure state.
Today we are here in the royal city of Bobovac, one of the symbols of the progressive state of Bosnia.
This place is a tangible testimony to the strength of our state and its ability to be its own and no one else's.
The then state of Bosnia, although torn between East and West, found its place under the sky, because, thanks to its then leadership, it was a stable country that firmly guarded its borders from external enemies. Here, on Bobovac, the Bosnian royal crown was kept. Today there are no crowns, but there is still the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And we must preserve it as the crown of the efforts of the generations that fought for it, from Kulin Ban to the present day.
The flag with Bosnian lillies would have never waved in front of the United Nations on May 22, 1992, had Stjepan II Kotromanić not built this medieval city, and had it not been for Ban Kulin and other medieval rulers before him.
The lilies flag would not have waved in 1992 had the anti-fascists of Bosnia and Herzegovina not restored the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina on November 25, 1943 in Mrkonjić Grad. Nor would it have happened without Bosnians and Herzegovinians who were willing to defend their homeland, as the crown of their great-grandfathers' efforts, at all costs.
We can and must be proud of all those who are deserving of the fact that we can stand here today. If we learn from their experiences and efforts, and I think we have learned, then we will surely know what we are to do in the future.
Our state was not given to us, it had been fought for with great difficulty. Therefore, we will not allow anyone's advocacy of backward concepts to to take us back to the battles we have won. The future belongs to those who want to look ahead. I believe that now there is a basis for the progress of the state, and that we will return to the past only as a commemoration.
I once again wish all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina a happy Statehood Day."
88765,Address by Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Šefik Džaferović at the official event marking the 28th anniversary of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzego,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88765&langTag=en-US,2020-09-01,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
It is my honour and pleasure to attend the anniversary of the establishment of the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The First Corps is one of the most important corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the broader, strategic picture of Bosnia and Herzegovina's defense against aggression, the First Corps played an irreplaceable role, performing its task of defending Sarajevo as the capital of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Had the aggressor succeeded in their intent, at the start of the aggression and especially on 2nd May 1992, it is quite probable that the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have been very difficult to defend.
Every unit of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in every part of the country had an invaluable role, because every fighter who was willing to risk his life in defence of the homeland deserves the deepest respect. However, we should not forget that the aggressor had a special focus on Sarajevo, bearing in mind its strategic importance, and the units that defended Sarajevo were a thorn in aggressor’s side.
Despite being immeasurably less armed than the aggressor forces, firstly formed units of the Patriotic League, the Territorial Defence, the Green Berets, and later united in the First Corps, had a much better and stronger motivation. Unlike the aggressors, the First Corps was a real people's army, made up of people who defended their country and their city, their homes and families, their freedom.
Frustrated by the fact that there was no force with which to occupy Sarajevo, the aggressor showed the criminal nature by exposing the civilian population of this city to a campaign of terrorism, sniper attacks and killing, which has remained a planetary symbol of modern barbarism.
There lies the key difference. The difference between civilization and barbarism was witnessed by the whole world.
While the aggressor forces carried out a joint criminal enterprise and carried out a campaign of terrorizing more than 350,000 citizens of Sarajevo, the First Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina protected all citizens of Sarajevo – Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs, Jews and all other citizens who faced relentless attacks.
While the aggressor tried to destroy everything that was Bosnian and Bosniak, the First Corps guarded the multi-ethnic fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sarajevo, maintaining it through its own composition.
While the aggressor barbarically set fire to the City Hall (Vijećnica), the Oriental Institute, the Post Office, the Olympic Museum, shelled the Presidency, the Bey's Mosque, the Church of St. Vinko Paulski and many other buildings, the First Corps guarded and protected the Orthodox Cathedral, the Old Orthodox Church, the Church of the Holy Transfiguration and other Orthodox places of worship.
While the military and political leaders of the aggressor forces - as determined by the judgments of international courts - ordered their army to commit mass crimes against civilians, the political and military leadership of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina systematically fought against individuals in their own ranks who had committed any crime.
The honourable First Corps, together with the state and military leadership of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, opposed the renegade commanders, who had begun to commit crimes against civilians.
Faced with the heaviest siege in modern history, the First Corps had to find additional strength to fight on the inner front as well, but in the end it managed to defend the honour of this state and this city.
Not only was it not recorded that the aggressor armies dealt criminals within their ranks, but, as it was determined in The Hague, their highest commanders, following a criminal policy, systematically ordered crimes and rewarded the cruelest perpetrators which their followers continue to do to this day.
We shall never forget shaheeds and fallen soldiers of the First Corps who laid their lives for the defence of Sarajevo, from Igman, across Žuč, to Trebević. We shall never forget the honourable names of Safet Zajko, Enver Šehović, Emir Bogunić Charlie, Čedomir Domuz, Vinko Šamarlić and other greatest sons of this country and this city.
We shall never forget war veteran invalids, and all soldiers of the First Corps, its commanders, brigades, battalions and commanders of other units.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The war is over, but the fight for the truth is still going on. The siege is over, but the political siege of Sarajevo is still in full swing.
Every day we hear expressions such as ""political Sarajevo"" and accusations against this city. Every day we witness attempts to distort the truth about the siege and aggression. These are the same lies that come from the same barbaric and cynical kitchen from which, after the biggest massacres in Markale or Vase Miskina Street, cynically mocking the passivity of the international community, they claimed that the citizens of Sarajevo were shelling themselves. Every city which has ever faced such evil, with such monstrosity, must remember forever.
These days, we have also heard messages that the Serbs lost Sarajevo and that there were apparently certain ""pure Serb municipalities"".
No Sarajevo municipality, nor the city of Sarajevo as a whole, has ever been purely Serb, just as it was neither purely Croat nor purely Bosniak. This city, as well as the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has always been purely multi-ethnic, which we can be proud of. That is why we must reject lies which are come from those ideological kitchens that actually had wanted pure Serb municipalities and pure Serb Sarajevo, but did not succeed.
It is a lie that the Serbs lost Sarajevo. It is the truth that Karadžić's and Mladić's hordes failed to subdue this city, primarily thanks to the magnificent resistance of the First Corps, which included many Sarajevo and Bosnian Serbs, true and sincere patriots, who recognized and chose the right side of history.
It is often forgotten how much victory for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I would say for the whole civilization, was the defence of Sarajevo and how fierce the defeat was for the aggressor forces, whose followers still cannot get over not conquering Sarajevo.
The glorious and honourable defence of the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be kept from oblivion, because only thanks to that struggle is Sarajevo today a free, European, open city, the capital of a sovereign and independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state that will sooner or later be a state of equal citizens and peoples.
We must remember this well and constantly highlight it. And we have to take care of those who are most deserving - fighters. This is what this state is doing and will continue to do.
Finally, I would like to extend best wishes to all members of the First Corps, on the occasion of this anniversary, with expressions of gratitude for all the sacrifices they have made.
Thank you."
88677,An Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović at the official event “Defence of BiH - Igman 2020”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88677&langTag=en-US,2020-08-06,"Dear members of the Shaheed families and the fallen soldiers, dear injured veterans, dear members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
We are here today to remember the Battle of Igman, one of the most significant battles during the defence against aggression, which the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina magnificently fought and won.
In the summer of 1993, the aggressor forces had a plan to completely close the ring around Sarajevo and cut off the last connection of the capital with the rest of the country. Had they succeeded, the military, strategic and political consequences would have been disastrous for the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although many times more technically superior, the aggressor forces failed in their intention. They failed because they had to face the heroic Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an army of honorable people who fought for the right goals, for their homeland, for freedom, for dignity, for the truth, for the idea of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state of equal people.
That was the greatest strength of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is the only armed force in the wars in the former Yugoslavia without a stain in its existence and its fight. This army was mostly composed of Bosniaks, but it had members of all Bosnia and Herzegovina’s peoples in its ranks. This army, unlike the aggressor forces, did not commit mass organized crimes, did not undertake joint criminal enterprises, ethnic cleansing, killings and torture of civilians ...
While others committed crimes systematically and in an organised manner, in the territory under the control of the Army of the Republic of BiH and the only legitimate government led by the late Alija Izetbegović, the crimes were prevented and systematically punished. And that is the key difference between us and them.
Yes, there were individual crimes committed by members of the Army of the Republic of BiH. We have condemned these crimes and we will always condemn them. We have no problem with that.
What we will not allow are the fabricated indictments against honorable people, officers of the Army of the Republic of BiH, which are trying to equalize the guilt at all cost. Some of these indictments have already been dropped in court. Some of our bravest soldiers, such as Ahmet Sejdić and Naser Orić, proved their honor and innocence. I am convinced that the other defendants will come out of the ongoing process free, with honour and with their heads held high.
Dear friends,
just as we were not the same in the war, we are not the same today. We have witnessed this in recent days, when we see that war crimes indictees are being rewarded in the neighbourhood, fugitives from justice, and that the criminal who ordered the establishment of the Sušica camp in Vlasenica is becoming a member of the state assembly.
Over the years in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have been witnessing the contenstation of final judgments of the international court on joint criminal enterprise on the one hand, and on the other, the even more difficult and disastrous practice of rewarding convicted criminals and celebrating their crime.
Policies which direct this cannot change the truth about what happened during the aggression against our country, they cannot change a single verdict of any court, nor will they ever be able to erase from our collective memory the images of evil we have survived and remember those as a warning not to allow it to ever happen again.
These policies, by such actions, in fact, speak most about themselves. They are persisting in these endevours. We all need to be aware of this.
In that sense, a new hoax has been attempted lately, in linking the solution for Kosovo to Bosnia and Herzegovina. My message to them is - give it up, because there is no possible link between the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, nor will there ever be. The only link between BiH and Kosovo is the crimes and ethnic cleansing committed by Milosević's Greater Serbia regime and its followers.
Other messages are sent to us, both rhetorical and practical. This will not frighten us, but it will strengthen our caution and our determination to protect the interests of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear friends,
it is clear to all of us that the struggle for Bosnia and Herzegovina continues. Fortunately, instead of bullets and grenades, the fight is being waged by political means.
On one side are the forces that want the disintegration of the state and division among its peoples and citizens, on the other are those that want the reintegration and equality of every man on every inch of our homeland.
On one side are those who think that they can link their destiny and interests with neighbouring countries, and on the other are those of us whom Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only home, and who do not have another motherland.
On the one side, there are those who, through various blockades and blackmail, want to make the functioning of the state meaningless, and on the other, there are those of us who, despite that and in spite of them, manage to patiently move things in favour of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On one side are those who want to slow down or stop Bosnia and Herzegovina's path towards the European Union and NATO, on the other are those of us who are leading the country step by step in that direction.
And rest assured, they will fail, we will succeed.
They will not succeed because they failed even when they were much stronger than they are today - nor are they as strong now as they would like to think of themselves.
We want to succeed, because the people who love this country are much stronger and more determined to preserve it than those who want to destroy it may think.
I call on them again to abandon secessionist and nationalist policies, because the result will never be the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the result will be a waste of precious time, a slowdown in the progress of the state and its economy, the departure of youth. It is not in anyone's interest.
Throughout history, Bosnia and Herzegovina has outlived all those who had attacked it.
It will outlive those negative forces of today.
Thank you."
88521,The Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović at the marking of the 25th anniversary of the Genocide against the Bosniaks of Srebrenica,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88521&langTag=en-US,2020-07-11,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, dear survivors, dear families of the victims of genocide, dear friends from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world! Today, here in the Potočari Valley of sorrow and pain, we are together to see off the remains of nine innocent victims, some of whom were young men, killed only because they belonged to one people - because they were Bosniaks.
Today, in the Potočari valley which is soaked in tears and sorrow, we bury the youth who will be laid to rest alongside hundreds of their peers, Salko Ibišević who was killed age 23, and only a few years older Sead Hasanović, Alija Suljić, Hasib Hasanović and Kemal Musić. We will also bury people who were killed in their middle age: Zuhdija Avdagić, Bajro Salihović, Ibrahim Zukanović, but also Hasan Pezić, killed at the age of 70.
Their white tombstones will be next to the tombstones of other innocently killed Srebrenica men, boys, women, next to the tombstone of the youngest victim, newborn Fatima Muhić, and the oldest victim, Šaha Izmirlić, killed at the age of 94. All absolutely innocent.
We are here to express our sympathy for their families and to remember with due reverence all the victims of the Srebrenica genocide, but also to remind that more than 1,000 people, whose bodies have been moved from one mass grave to another to cover up the crimes, are still to be found.
We are marking this 25th anniversary of genocide against the Bosniaks of the ""UN Safe Haven Srebrenica"", in special circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, that did not prevent us from marking this saddest anniversary in the history of our people here, in our Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also around the world.
And nothing will ever stop us from continuing to do so. It is our duty to remember, to preserve the truth about genocide and to warn: for our own sake and for the sake of the whole world. It will remain our duty until the Day of Judgment.
Everything is known about the genocide of the Bosniaks in Srebrenica, the truth is clear and complete and it is sealed by final judgments of international and domestic courts.
It is clear from these verdicts that the genocide in Srebrenica was a planned and systematically committed crime committed by Karadžić's and Mladić's death squads, the Army and Police of Republika Srpska, aided by units from Serbia, in order to completely wipe out the existence of one people in this area. Serbia and the then regime were declared responsible because they could but did not prevent genocide.
The genocide, which took place in front of the eyes of the whole world, could, but unfortunately was not prevented by the then leading world leaders, including the United Nations. Despite the resolution declaring Srebrenica a ""UN Safe Haven"", no concrete steps were taken to stop the brutal killings of innocent men, children, women, pregnant women, and the elderly.
The result of the lack of concrete action to stop the ideology of evil and its horde of murderers are white tombstones here in Potočari. They will forever be a reminder to humanity that there must be no calculations in opposing evil.
The UN officials themselves have acknowledged that Srebrenica will forever remain a black stain on the conscience of all those who could and did not prevent the genocide. In its report on Srebrenica, the United Nations stated:
''Through error, misjudgement and the inability to recognize the scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder. No one regrets more than us for the chances for peace and justice that were missed. No one condemns more than us the failure of the international community to take decisive steps to stop the suffering and war that has produced so many casualties.""
Today, 25 years later, there is a growing awareness throughout the civilized world about the scale of the crime committed and the mistakes made. Srebrenica has become a synonym for the suffering of innocent people, and the crime that was committed then is called the only applicable name for it – Genocide.
The anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide is now being marked around the world. People across all meridians sympathize with the families of the victims and our people. Today you could also hear messages from the leaders of the modern world, where there is no dilemma as to what happened in those July days of 1995 and who is responsible for it.
Those messages mean a lot to us and I take this opportunity to thank all the presidents, prime ministers and other officials who have expressed their sympathy for the families of the victims of genocide and who have contributed to our fight for the truth.
At the same time, I take this opportunity to warn all our friends around the world to show, in addition to words and deeds, that they do not accept attempts to deny genocide and to celebrate and glorify the organizers and perpetrators of this horrific crime.
And, unfortunately, we are witness to that.
Instead of the expected catharsis, confession of genocide, apology, arrest and prosecution of many direct perpetrators who are still at large, we are witnessing the same planned and systematic denial of genocide.
Instead of the acknowledgement, a sincere apology and condemnation, the ideology that planned and realized genocide is very much still alive in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. This ideology today attacks the truth by minimizing and denying genocide. The science says this is the last stage of genocide.
It’s not just an insult to the families of the victims, it’s much more than that. The deniers of genocide, in fact, speak the most about themselves and send us a clear message that they have not given up.
That is why we and the whole world must resolutely oppose them. There is no room for mistakes and indecision.
It is high time we were helped and the international community, which has a mandate to do so, immediately imposes the law banning genocide denial.
The issue of banning genocide denial does not only concern Srebrenica, Bosniaks and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it concerns the entire world. It is a universal question of the struggle of good and evil.
Dear friends,
in recent years, the words truth and justice have been uttered many times from this and other places.
These are not just ordinary words, they are also our message.
Acceptance of the truth and just punishment of perpetrators of genocide, as well as perpetrators of other crimes wherever they were committed and whoever committed them, are the first and basic preconditions for restoring trust in this region.
There can be no trust as long as attacks on the truth, denial of genocide, and glorification and rewarding of perpetrators continue.
That is why today, as it has been done many times before, I call on the political, religious and intellectual elites of the Serb people, who have suffered a lot throughout history, to gather strength and face the truth honestly and to, without hesitation, refrain from the ideology and regime that committed genocide against Bosniaks in their name.
Let them do it for the families of the victims, for us, but mostly for themselves. Let them not leave that heavy burden as a burden to the generations to come.
Those generations, from both peoples, deserve better lives than the lives we live. It is the duty of our generation to provide better lives for them.
We have always lived together in this region. And we should continue to live together.
We will remember our pains, our sorrows, our misfortunes and our sufferings and live with them, but we are obliged to think of both the present and the future.
As we wait for the day when our neighbours will have the strength to face the truth and thus enable the process of restoring trust, it is up to us to make daily efforts to build a society and a state in which every man will be equal on every inch of this land, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation.
It is up to us to build a modern, democratic and prosperious state with the help of our friends, and despite obstacles; the state that will be part of the European family and in which people will be able to peacefully build a future for themselves and their children, but also a state that will guarantee that no similar crimes are ever committed against anyone, ever again.
We have a special duty towards Srebrenica and the whole Podrinje area, which must be the places of sustainable return, where people will live peacefully, from their work. A lot of things have been done in that area, but a lot more remains to be done.
We will remember the victims forever, preserve the truth about the genocide, and it is up to each of us to show special responsibility and help Srebrenica become a place of living again.
It is our debt to the innocent victims and their families. Thanks."
88507,Speech by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić in the Memorial Church in Berlin to mark the 25th anniversary of the Genocide in Srebrenica,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88507&langTag=en-US,2020-07-09,"Esteemed priests, ladies and gentlemen, dear citizens of Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany!
I feel extremely honoured that I can address you in a few sentences, in this city and in this place of significant meaning and name, in the Memorial Church, and on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the genocide committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Srebrenica.
Before I start, I would like to take this opportunity, bearing in mind that the notion of remembrance is what brought us together here today, to remember the victims of the horrific terrorist attack which happened during a Christmas fair four years ago, not far from of this place, when twelve innocent people were killed.
Such a horrible manifestation of a crime committed out of insanity and hatred, for us who come from Bosnia and Herzegovina can never go unnoticed, and cannot be easily forgotten, because we felt insanity and hatred as citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of the last century. It was, unfortunately, proof that evil is not so fleeting, and that it returns, even when you least expect it.
The very nature of a good man finds it difficult to accept evil as an objective possibility. The good nature wants to suppress such thoughts and exclude it as a reality, however despite the belief of the good ones, evil has happened numerous times in the history of mankind. Because forgetting is the first precondition for evil to return, and remembering evil, is the first precondition for it never to happen again.
If all the evils and sufferings that happened in the Second World War, which left unforeseeable consequences, had not been repeated in my country at the end of the last century, I would have said that it is easy to remember. I cannot say that today, given what I have experienced and survived. Remember, that is hard. Therefore, although it is difficult, it is paramount.
We in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot, will not, nor do we want to forget what happened to us. If we’d agreed to that, we would give approve of those who wanted to destroy our state and at the same time to destroy an entire nation from the face of the earth.
Srebrenica is in fact only the focal point of the Bosnian genocide, i.e. criminal operations conducted against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens, from the beginning to the end of the aggression, from 1992 to 1995, because the same or similar crimes were committed in other cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the same intent and with the same or similar genocidal consequences.
Yet Srebrenica is the one that has been remembered by the world as a black stain in modern history, the stain on the conscience of the most advanced part of the world and civilization. For Bosnia and Herzegovina and most of its citizens, Srebrenica is a fundamental determination of its present, and a determination of the lives of several generations of people.
The relevant verdicts of international and domestic courts have only partially satisfied justice, although these verdicts can hardly be a particular mental satisfaction for victims of genocide. However, they are only a scientific contribution to history and the truth about the facts that cannot and must not be a topic of any negotiations today, because one does not negotiate about the facts.
However, some, even in our neighborhood, who bear responsibility for genocide, still seem to expect the victim to lend a hand to the criminal in the name of a more pleasant future - instead of the criminal kneeling before the victim in the name of a just and peaceful future.
We do not have the right to order things that way today, we do not have the right to do so as human beings, because we cannot forgive in the name of the victims and their families; we have no right as an advanced society either, because violence must not be a value and a path that pays off.
The victims of genocide have so many times shown willingness to reconcile, that this willingness is simply fascinating, which is especially evident in those who have suffered the greatest and heaviest losses. They are glad to reconcile, but they prefer the truth, and I appreciate that they are completely right, because reconciliation without the truth is a false reconciliation, and an interlude to new tragedies.
We need a partnership based on a common interest, and we believe that peace is the common interest of all. The people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want peace more than anyone, and that is why we insist more than others in the region on suppressing any signs of the emergence of ideologies that can repeat or try to repeat the genocide. We will never stop insisting on that, because it is not only a political but also a moral responsibility. We want to be responsible to ourselves and to others. We want to break once and for all the chain of suffering that permeates our common history."
88225,"Address by Šefik Džaferović, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina delivered at the European Union - Western Balkans Summit",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88225&langTag=en-US,2020-05-06,"Dear President of the European Council, Dear President of the European Commission, Dear High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Ladies and gentlemen presidents and prime ministers, dear colleagues,
First of all, let me express my sincerer condolences to the families of the victims in your countries. In our prayers and thoughts, we remain close to those who are facing the most difficult situations, as well as to those who are fighting the coronavirus in the first lines.
The situation which all of us have been facing is one of the biggest challenges of our time. COVID-19 has known no borders, regions, or nations. However, despite the physical isolation, the current misfortune has brought us closer together, and stressed the need for ""n enhanced mutual cooperation and solidarity alike.
In regards to this, let me point out the following three issues:
On behalf of BiH and its citizens, I extend our thanks to the European Union and its member states for the assistance and support they provided to us in this difficult period. We know that this was not easy for them, we know that most members of the European Union have also been facing very difficult situations. Therefore, the assistance of the European Union is all the more important and symbolic.
The assistance provided by the European Union to our country in these difficult times also represents a very important political message that Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans remain one of the main geopolitical priorities of the European Union, and that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union.
In this context, I would like to express our contentment for BiH's participation in the Joint EU Procurement Agreement of Medical Countermeasures, as well as for the European Union's decision to exempt the Western Balkans from the obligation to obtain export permits for medical equipment.
Further, let me express out contentment for the organization of today's video meeting, which offers us a possibility to continue the high-level political dialogue with the European Union and its member states. The mere fact that the European Union decided to hold this meeting, despite the very difficult situation it is in, enhances the political message on the importance that the European Union attaches to the Western Balkans as its natural part.
On behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I hereby avail myself of the opportunity to extend our thanks to the Croatian Chairmanship over the European Union for including the Western Balkans in the top priorities, which enabled the present Summit to take place.
Today's Summit is a great opportunity for us to re-iterate how much we appreciate the European Union's approach aimed at including its neighbourhood, with a special place reserved for the Western Balkans, in its strategy of economic recovery.
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that, within the implementation of the strategy of economic recovery of our region's portfolio, a special focus should be put on the sectors which will have most significant positive impact on the economic revival, including a an enhanced implementation of the Connectivity Agenda through continuing and intensifying the infrastructure works, the energy sector, with a special focus on energy transformation and the so-called ""Green Agenda“, digitization of the society, as well as the support for small and medium enterprises.
The competent institutions in BiH have been working hard on the preparation of the project proposals, which we will submit to the European Commission in the forthcoming period.
Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the publication of the new enlargement package in June. We are certain that the new enlargement package, following the European Union's decisions on opening the negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, will be a new important incentive for the accelerated progress of the whole region along the European Union's path.
More than ever before, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina need a concrete indicator of their European perspective, i.e. of the candidate status. Our ultimate goal is membership in the European Union, and the candidate status is one of the steps to be taken on that path. It is time for the European Union to enable us to make that next step, so that we can see that the membership in the European Union is both achievable and realistic, that the efforts invested are meaningful, and that we can be encouraged to continue to carry out the necessary reforms.
It is necessary that the competent institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina double their efforts aimed at the implementation of the key priorities. One should take into consideration that some of the key priorities demand a comprehensive elaboration and wider discussions aimed at reaching a possible agreement on the way in which their implementation would be approached.
In view of this, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated (last week, on April 28, 2020) the process of the implementation of the 14 key priorities by establishment of an ad hoc Political Working Group, and tasked the Chairman of the Council of Ministers to initiate a process of drafting the Action Plan for the Implementation of the 14 Priorities set out in the European Commission's Opinion, along with precisely defined deadlines, mandates and indicators.
I avail myself of this opportunity to re-iterate that the most important strategic priority of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to become a member of the European Union.
Certainly, Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully aware of the fact that the speed of our progress along the European Union's path depends primarily on ourselves, on how efficiently we will manage to meet the necessary conditions and transform our society in accordance with the EU standards.
Thirdly, the regional cooperation in the Western Balkans is, in our opinion, an integral part of the whole region's European path. Connected with the shared strategic goal – the membership in the European Union – the countries of our region have had to mutually cooperate.
Good regional cooperation is also the best way for all of us in the region to show in a concrete way our readiness for the respect and application of the standards and principles the European Union is based on. I believe that all of us are fully aware that the path to Brussels leads though its regional cooperation section.
A need for a further enhancement of the regional cooperation in the forthcoming period of economic recovery will be even more emphasized through defining and implementing of large joint projects, as this is the best way to revive our economies.
Despite the well-known problems, our region has achieved an enviable progress in the area of regional cooperation in the previous period. The Regional Economic Area (MAP REA) project will end this year. We implemented it within the Berlin Process. This is an opportunity for all of us to see which direction we should proceed in, and further intensify our cooperation, so that we can bring our economies closer to the joint European Union's market.
Of course, all of us agree that our region should continue to implement the social and economic reforms. However, I am also certain that the Western Balkans should and can benefit greatly from a better cooperation in the areas of internal affairs, the rule of law, security, and a better coordination in the joint responses to crisis situations.
Finally, I wold like to express hereafter my belief that all of us will grow stronger and more united out of the current crisis. Bosnia and Herzegovina appreciates it very much that in these difficult moments it can count on the strong support of the European Union and its member states, which are our strategic partners.
Thank you."
88217,BiH Presidency Chairman Šefik Džaferović participated at the EPP Summit shortly before the European Union - Western Balkan Summit,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=88217&langTag=en-US,2020-05-06,"President Donald Tusk, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković as host, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and others attended the European People's Party (EPP) Summit, held in the form of a video conference.
In his address Chairman Džaferović said:
Dear President Tusk, esteemed ladies and gentlemen!
Allow me to greet you as the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also on behalf of the Party of Democratic Action of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the extraordinary circumstances have sadly not allowed for us to meet in person, I am glad that there is this opportunity for us to exchange views and experiences.
The health crisis, which is still in force in Europe, has prevented many established contacts, from international traffic to the most ordinary human encounters. But this crisis has also shown us how interconnected people, nations and states are and how dependent they are on each other.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown what a destructive power it has not only for human health, but also for the entire economic, institutional and social system. But the outcome of a crisis situation ultimately depends on how we approach it.
Solidarity and togetherness should be the key things we will remember about this crisis, one day when it passes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has so far successfully responded to the health aspect of the pandemic crisis, taking timely and appropriate protection measures.
We face serious challenges regarding the inevitable negative economic consequences.
I thank the European Union, which has provided BiH with important assistance in overcoming both the health and economic crisis. This is incomparably the most significant support that Bosnia and Herzegovina has received.
Like any other crisis, this one can be a chance to strengthen European unity. Common trouble can bring us even closer and unite us. This time again, it was made clear that we can successfully take on the challenges we face only by undertaking joint action.
I believe that in this way, the situation regarding the pandemic should be viewed by all of us who are supporters of a united Europe, a strong European Union and the continuation of European and Euro-Atlantic integration.
The absence of a unified and solidary action of the European Union, or even the very indications of that, open room for involvement of some other and different policies and influences, both in the European Union itself and in the Western Balkans in particular.
We are part of Europe, but we also want to be part of the European Union and its institutions. That is the main foreign policy priority and strategic interest of my country. There is a consensus on this in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The other countries in the Western Balkans are also committed to membership in the European Union.
For all the reasons I have stated, it is very important that Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire Western Balkans receive very clear messages about the foreseeable prospect of full membership in the European Union. Certainly, it is up to us to take concrete steps in order to speed up the implementation of reforms and fulfill the required conditions.
It would be extremely important for Bosnia and Herzegovina to receive the candidate status and open negotiations later this year. After the political, and now the pandemic crisis, I believe that the time has come to dedicate ourselves to the accelerated implementation of the recommendations from the European Commission Opinion. The first steps, in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union to BiH and our other partners, have already been made.
A credible European perspective represents the strongest mechanism for advancing human rights, the rule of law and establishing internal political cohesion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and one of the most important factors in socio-economic progress. That is why I emphasize once again that the European path remains our permanent and strategic commitment, for the benefit of our citizens and in accordance with the mutual interests of the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Party of Democratic Action, as a member of the European People's Party, has always nurtured a commitment to European integration, and there are no dilemmas for us in that sense.
Thank you."

This was done after the negotiating parties in Dayton failed to find a solution which all sides would be satisfied with.
Esteemed representatives of the Brčko District’s institutions,
Esteemed representatives of the international community,
Esteemed representatives of all administrative levels in BiH,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Esteemed representatives of the Brčko District’s institutions,
Esteemed representatives of the international community,
Esteemed representatives of all administrative levels in BiH,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is with great pleasure that I attend this celebration, and I hereby extend my thanks to you for inviting me to do so.
I extend my congratulations to all female and male citizens of Brčko on the Day of the Brčko District and the 20th anniversary of its establishment.
It was exactly two decades ago that the International Arbitrage Court passed its decision to establish the Brčko District. This was done after the negotiating parties in Dayton failed to find a solution which all sides would be satisfied with.
During the Dayton negotiations, it even seemed impossible to find a solution that all parties would agree to. However, the solution was found after all.
It was still uncertain pursuant to the Arbitration Court’s decision whether the solution achieved would be sustainable or only temporary. Today, twenty years later, it has turned out that it was a satisfactory one, which has not been disputed by anyone. Moreover, during the last 20 years, the Brčko District has been positioned as a successful multiethnic community, with both functional and sustainable institutional frameworks.
While marking the 20th anniversary of establishment of the Brčko District, we need to remind ourselves of the key lessons learnt from that event.
First of all, the case of Brčko District has demonstrated that we can, in both peaceful and civilized way, resolve even such issues that could not be resolved during the peace negotiations in Dayton.
This was made possible as it represented a compromise, by which no one was fully satisfied, and yet no one had any reason to be fully dissatisfied. This is the essence of a compromise – that everyone rejects their unilateral demands and any accompanying ultimatums. Such path of a compromise as the only efficient way of moving things forward, in which there is no winners and no defeated ones, has been demonstrated not only in the case of Brčko District but in many other cases, too.
Further, the Arbitrage Agreement is the solution for the Brčko District, and it is not a part of the original Dayton arrangement. The solution for Brčko District represents a natural course of the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which includes international mediation.
This is yet another key lesson from establishment of the Brčko District. It illustrates the essence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the post-Dayton period.
The solutions reached once with everyone’s give respective consent granted must be respected unconditionally, as long as we reach some different solutions. None of us has the right to dispute unilaterally the solutions established by the Dayton Agreement or reached through its implementation.
Dayton means all this.
One such solution is certainly the Brčko District, without which it is impossible to talk about the constitutional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina today.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In the last two decades, the Brčko District has undergone a very important phase of its political and institutional stabilization alike. I wish from the bottom of my heart that the next two decades be marked with an enhanced economic development and prosperity, to the benefit of all citizens of the Brčko District.
The Brčko District is a symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is my main message to you today to guard good relations, respect and acknowledge each other, as it is only in that way that you can create an environment worth living in, in which no one will be restricted and everyone will feel comfortable.
The Brčko District, the same as Bosnia and Herzegovina, is large enough to be comfortable for all its residents. It is our homework to arrange our relations in such a way that will allow for a country in which the new generations will be able to plan their future peacefully.
Thank you for your attention."
87691,The address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić at the reception marking the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=87691&langTag=en-US,2020-02-27,"Your excellences, eminences, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, It is with pride that we remind ourselves tonight of the first of March as the day when Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence, the day when the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by using referendum as a democratic instrument, expressed their citizen will to have a sovereign and independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The result of their vote created preconditions for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s international recognition.
In the ensuing period, just like numerous times in its history, Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown yet again its indestructibility. Those who love her, her citizens, led by the love of their homeland, have done their best to preserve her international legal personality, and they have succeeded in doing so. No one could kill neither the hope nor the belief of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in what they stood for, and we stood up for the same values we stand up for today: for the state of equal citizens, the state in which has always, and there always will be a place for everyone.
Such a state was desired and is desired now by the vast majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, however, we must maturely oppose all attempts at partition, whether on the political, party or ideological basis. We also give and should extend our hand to those who did not vote for the independence of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or are still opposed to independence and sovereignty. My message, to those fellow citizens, is honest, short and clear. This is your country too. Nobody wants to, nor will they take her away from you. She belongs to all of us, so let’s make her better than she is today, if not for ourselves, then at least for the sake of our children. We must not allow for our children to start hating their home, so they seek their happiness and life chances away from this country. We must give them hope that this country can be the best place in the world for them.
We can only succeed in doing so if we, as responsible people, refrain from expressing disrespect and misunderstanding towards one another, refrain from spreading unnecessary fears, bypassing the law and undermining the institutions that are our state, and must be at service to everyone equally. It is easy to break trust, respect, and unfortunately even institutions, but this is an act of folly, and folly always has tragic consequences.
After all, I still somewhat hope that everything we have witnessed in recent days which was not directed towards building a better society but was focused on destruction, that all of that is just one bad act, one poor choice of methods in political action. I believe that a belligerent person, in times of peace, primarily attacks himself. Therefore, instead of destruction and strife, let the race for peace and prosperity be a major challenge and one in which we will compete.
We, as citizens, society and the state, face the fulfilment of numerous conditions in order to move closer to a safer living environment within broader international associations, which is outlined in our foreign policy priorities. However, we should know that no one outside this country has more interest or benefit than us who share the same skies. We will not find greater friends in the world unless we find them among ourselves, and I believe we can do that. Finally, without shying away from our hot Balkan blood and temperament, we still just want to be a normal, peaceful, and a safe country."
86879,"Address by Željko Komšić, Chairman of BiH Presidency at the ceremony held on the occasion of marking the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=86879&langTag=en-US,2019-11-29,"During the last fourteen years, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven themselves as a powerful and reliable support pole to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens alike. The Armed Forces of BiH are, beyond doubt, a better part of our society, as well as an indicator that the reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be conducted successfully indeed.
Esteemed excellences, dear generals, officers and lieutenants, dear soldiers, dear guests!
On behalf of BiH Presidency, which is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, and on my own behalf, it is my pleasure to address you today on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Armed Forces of BiH.
During the last fourteen years, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have proven themselves as a powerful and reliable support pole to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens alike. The Armed Forces of BiH are, beyond doubt, a better part of our society, as well as an indicator that the reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be conducted successfully indeed.
The primary purpose of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. At the same time, this is a basic precondition for the integration of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the wider defence and security systems, such as the NATO Alliance, under whose framework, while relying on our own forces, we can be not only safe but also prosperous as a state and a society alike.
The Armed Forces of BiH have not only taken care of the security of our society, but, through their active participation in the peace missions, especially the one in Afghanistan, have demonstrated that they have been a reliable partner to all the countries and societies striving to achieve global peace and security. The readiness and determination of the AFBiH to participate in the peace missions in order to keep or establish peace in the world have deserved nothing but praise. The engagement of our soldiers in these noble missions has made us proud. However, it has also imposed an obligation on us to ensure that the overall status of the Armed Forces' members should be raised to a higher level.
I avail myself of this opportunity to express my satisfaction over the activities conducted by the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let me take as an example the successfully completed military exercise held in September this year at Manjača. Over a thousand AFBiH soldiers participated in it. This exercise was organized with the assistance provided by NATO. As well as many other military exercises, this one shows the readiness of the Armed Forces to achieve the necessary NATO standards, and represents the AFBiH's longest step forward to raising the level of interoperability, which is, in many ways, the key factor of cooperation and achievement of NATO standards respectively. All these activities have been recognized as significant by our partner countries. Therefore, I am not surprised in the least by the statements in this regard given at my bilateral meetings with the representatives of the ministries of defence of our friendly countries.
The fact is, and I believe it is necessary to underline it today, that, for the first time since it was established, the marking was made of the Light Infantry Battalion Group. Namely, the group was marked as “combat ready“. The credits for such successes certainly go also to the Joint Command of the Armed Forces of BiH, which established an excellent cooperation with the Allied Forces in Europe.
For the Armed Forces to be enabled to continue to achieve good results, the decisions of the state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina are needed in order to create the necessary preconditions enabling such progress.
Last year, at this very same place, on the occasion of marking the thirteenth anniversary of the AFBiH, we talked about the need of meeting the conditions for The Membership Action Plan (MAP).
Now, a year later, we are glad to stablish that Bosnia and Herzegovina has been in MAP since 5 December 2018, and that, in accordance with the decision made by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Annual National Program of reforms is being submitted to the NATO headquarters. This program will create a new dynamics of the integration processes towards NATO.
The process, for which we were waiting for years to start unfolding, has now been unblocked, which certainly represents an additional encouragement for all members of the Armed Forces of BiH, as well as for all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Nowadays, it is unlikely that it can seem easy to anyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina to try to degrade the role or importance of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina again by any political machination. We witnessed such attempts indeed. However, they failed ultimately. Nevertheless, I am glad that I remain assured that there will be no such attempts made in the future. The ones who dare trying to do that must know that they by doing so they will be risking everything and gaining nothing in the process.
Hoping that, in the course of the next year, when we will be marking the fifteenth anniversary since the Armed Forces of BiH were established, we will again be in a position to acknowledge further advances and progress achieved, especially in the area of integration processes, I hereby extend my congratulations to all members of the Armed Forces on the anniversary of the day when the AFBiH were established.
Thank you."
86866,"Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, upon invitation of the Chicago-based Bosnian and Herzegovinian community, attended the Solemn Academy held on the occasion of marki",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=86866&langTag=en-US,2019-11-25,"Chairman Komšić delivered a speech on this occasion: My dear Bosnians and Herzegovinians, Excellences, Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends... I am both honoured and grateful to be here with you tonight, once again. Thank you for the invitation and such a warm welcome here in the United States of America, our friend and ally, where we gathered to mark the most important date in the modern history of Bosnia and Herzegovina – the Statehood Day, i.e. to mark the anniversary of the first session of the State Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH).
We must never forget that it is our permanent obligation to underline the civilizational significance of ZAVNOBiH as the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We both can and must be proud of the fact that 76 years ago the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of their national or ideological orientations, while occupied by the fascists, constituted their state's authorities on the basis of the anti-fascist principles, i.e. the principles of the free and democratic world. They were determined, while opposing the evil, to defend and preserve their homeland and organize it as a country of equal citizens and peoples.
The historical documents talk about this to a certain extent only. The resolutions and declarations of ZAVNOBiH are just a sum of efforts invested on the path to freedom and a united country. That path was marked for us by those who cleared the snow and mud on it, while shedding their own blood and sweat. Their endeavour could not be stopped by the fascist tanks, planes or cannons.
The atrocities perpetrated by the domestic quislings could not stop them either. Those quislings will always remain inseparable from the pillar of shame, from which no revisionists or forgers of history will be able to remove them because such position was defined for them by the civilized part of the world.
The ZAVNOBiH delegates, members of the National Liberation Movement, i.e. the nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina were all on that civilized side of the world. There were a few countries in Europe of that time, which the fascists managed to occupy, and which, nevertheless, managed to constitute the anti-fascist rule under the fascist occupation.
The citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina gathered their strength, wits, and knowledge for such an endeavour. Therefore, I dare to say here tonight that Bosnia and Herzegovina, historically speaking, cannot be lectured by anyone on the issue of civilizational values. While our ancestors bled and sacrificed their lives, many gentlemen in Europe bowed their heads and lowered their eyes cowardly before Hitler and the ghosts of fascism.
Therefore, we will not allow anyone, regardless of what their names are, or the influence they currently have, to offend or undermine the dignity of our citizens today.
The one who is not willing to invest efforts to preserve the dignity of the citizens of our country cannot preserve our country either. That is how it has always been like, that is how it is now, and that is how it will always be.
The citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by constituting the anti-fascist rule on the 25th of November, demonstrated their social and political maturity alike. At the same time, the delegates of ZAVNOBiH demonstrated their political courage and readiness to take responsibility for making big decisions. The history has confirmed the magnitude and importance of these decisions of theirs.
Those who made such decisions were maybe not aware of their colossal importance. However, they were courageous, determined and united at that time. They knew where they were, where they were going to, and where they wanted to arrive. All that was recognized at a wider international plan. That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina was, and still is, a part of the wider anti-fascist alliance.
The current geopolitical orientation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was predetermined back then. If that were not the case, the First of March 1992 would not have neem possible as the Independence Day, nor would the 22nd of May be possible as the day of admission of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations.
Thus, we were indeed at the right side of history at the right time, together with the United States of America that, for all these years since, and until now, have remained a true friend of our state and her citizens.
Bosnia and Herzegovina survived thanks to the awareness of her citizens on where they belong, and thanks to her friends who knew how to recognize it.
Big decisions are being made again in Bosnia and Herzegovina now. These current decisions are certainly not as courageous as were the decisions of November 1943. However, they are important as indicators of our state's continuity. Again, those states which were at the side of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1943 are on her side now as well. Such decisions are based on the agreement and consensus. It is never easy to reach them. However, despite everything, we have been reaching them, thus strengthening our state.
On the other hand, what is encouraging is the fact that most citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina truly understand the importance of such decisions, as well as that it is not easy to reach them, that a lot of patience and perseverance is needed in the course of the decision making processes.
If you want to know if you made a right decision, listen to the pulse of the people, and everything will become clear.
The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognize what is important for our country. I would dare to say that this is the same level of recognition of the important issues as it was the case back in November 1943.
The decisions of ZAVNOBiH, which correspond to the values endorsed by the civilized world, have lived through the awareness of the citizens on the interests of their state - Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, I hereby extend my congratulations on the Statehood Day to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Happy Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
86762,"Address of the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina H.E. Šefik Džaferović at the Reception on the Occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina Sarajevo, November 21, 2019",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=86762&langTag=en-US,2019-11-21,"By celebrating the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina we mark the first session held by the Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBIH) on 25 November 1943, at which its participants restored and reaffirmed the statehood of our country and its territorial integrity.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Excellencies
Dear friends
It is a great honor to welcome you tonight at the reception on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By celebrating the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina we mark the first session held by the Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBIH) on 25 November 1943, at which its participants restored and reaffirmed the statehood of our country and its territorial integrity.
With pride and due respect, we remember the generation of Bosnia and Herzegovinian patriots who not only had the courage to oppose fascism, but also the resolve, vison, and wisdom to confirm the historical and legal continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In such difficult circumstances, in a war-affected Europe and the world, not only were the foundations for the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina laid anew, but also - which is equally important - the unity and equality of all its peoples and citizens was affirmed as well.
People of various ethnic and religious backgrounds have lived here side by side for centuries. Ideas of community and equality represent the very essence of Bosnia and Hercegovina.
Greater-state aspirations that have caused the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s have attacked the very postulates of ZAVNOBIH: statehood, territorial integrity and our unity. They wanted to destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina, they wanted supremacy of one people over the others, or for one people to simply disappear.
But we fought them back.
Together.
We had defended the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We had defended its territorial integrity.
With the same reverence and gratitude with which we remember the generation that gave us ZAVNOBIH, today we also express our gratitude to the generation of the BiH patriots who defended this country form the last aggression. And they keep defending it today.
The forces that had attacked BiH have not been fully defeated, therefore, we are left with rebuilding and strengthening our community, and fight for the equality of all people in every inch of BiH.
It is a gruesome fight filled with difficult challenges. Yet, despite all the resistance, obstructions and obstacles we witness every day, BiH is moving forward even though it does it slowly one step at the time and it will continue to move forward.
Our goal is clear- BiH as a modern, prosperous state where all people are equal, member of the EU and NATO.
Rest assured, we will surely reach that goal.
Dear friends,
In the 24 post Dayton years of BiH a lot has been done, numerous reforms have been implemented and progress was achieved. Sometimes these processes went at a faster and sometimes at a slower pace.
We made a faster progress while we had a pronounced presence of our friend s form the international community in BiH. The weakening of their interests has resulted in a strengthening of destructive politics which are trying to refute the existing solutions, laws and decisions. Such politics are trying to demote BiH and pull it into new ethnic and even territorial division.
To all of them I would like to state again that it is a futile waste of time, for in this they cannot succeed. It is demonstrated to them clearly every day.
The only thing that can be result of such politics is the exodus of young people from this country, the weakening of the economy and political instability turning investors away. Nobody needs this, nor can it be of use to anybody in this country.
What people of this country need are peace, jobs, economic stability, progress, justice a system guaranteeing equal rights to everyone and a clear perspective offering the hope that they will be able to provide a decent life for themselves and their children.
People are tired from crisis and political disputes.
Therefore it is high time to cease with the irrational obstructions, blockage and attempts to unilaterally change the existing constitutional and legal framework. Too many times we have witnessed, particularly during the last year, that crisis brings nothing good to anyone and that ultimate and unilateral approach achieves nothing.
Instead, we should all together turn to constructive dialogue based on truth and justice, mutual respect, respect of the rule of law, European standards and cooperation for the benefit of all of our people.
We have demonstrated many times that we can agree upon matters and reach compromise; find solutions in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina that harm no one and benefit all.
I wish to believe that the agreement that we have achieved two days ago here in the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be a turning point beyond which this country will strongly move forward.
We all need to step out of the dangerous matrix according to which, once an agreement is reached, someone always needs to be a winner, and someone needs to be defeated. A compromise, an agreement between all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not, and can never be anyone’s defeat.
On the contrary, it can only be a victory for all of us, a victory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, each and every one of its parts and each and every one of its citizens.
With hope that there shall be many such agreements and victories for all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the upcoming period, to all of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina I congratulate the Statehood Day of our homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you."
86629,"Address by Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency of BiH to the Global Convention of the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=86629&langTag=en-US,2019-11-04,"Dear Ms Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Esteemed representatives of UN Women and UN trust Fund, Esteemed participants of the Convention, Ladies and gentlemen, media representatives, I am glad that I was granted an opportunity to address this important Global Convention of the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women.
The Bosnian and Herzegovinian society has faced a lot of challenges in the last decades, including the burning issue of violence against women. According to the statistics provided by the competent institutions, there are over 50% of women in Bosnia and Herzegovina who, since their age of 15, have experienced some form of violence.
These figures are devastating and alarming facts for all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina, urging us to address the problem and get actively involved in suppressing it.
Violence against women and girls is not and should not be a problem which concerns individuals only. I as an individual and you as parts of the society you live in are responsible of recognizing the features and forms of violence taking place around us. We are obliged to act towards supporting harassed women and girls, while working actively towards creating an environment which will prevent such harassment.
By providing selfless support we will encourage the victims to report the violence they suffered to the competent institutions, while sending a clear message to the perpetrators that they will be punished.
Any form of violence against women or girls represents a violation of the fundamental human rights. In addition to offending a victim, it also has immense consequences to the surroundings in which the victim lives, as well as the consequences to the persons close to the victim, i.e. her family members.
Being a part of the contemporary and civilized society, we are obliged to prevent violence. We are obliged to speak out publicly about this problem, and support the institutions which are ready to undertake measures aimed at suppressing it.
It is important to underline that Bosnia and Herzegovina has undertaken a number of steps so far on achieving a significant progress in creating the preconditions for prevention of violence against women and girls, as well as on ensuring gender equality.
It is the achievement of such objectives that is a priority in promoting, protecting and ensuring the rights of women and girls, and mitigating all forms of violence against them.
The adopted Gender Equality Act in BiH, the legal standards defined by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the objectives defined by the Beijing Declaration and its Platform for Action have been integrated in the legislative system of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to achieve the gender equality objectives, Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted its third Gender Action Plan for the period from 2018 to 2022. Bosnia and Herzegovina was the sixth member of the Council of Europe that ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (The Istanbul Convention).
The laws on protection from domestic violence were adopted, too, and the significant efforts were invested in ensuring protection and support services for the victims of violence, whereas the relevant laws and bylaws have been harmonized with the Istanbul Convention standards. Bosnia and Herzegovina was the first country in the region to adopt and successfully implement the Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Resolution 1325 “Women, Peace, and Security”.
The Third Action plan for the implementation of the UN Resolution 1325 in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period from 2018 to 2022 was adopted by the Council of Ministers, with the aim of consistent, high quality and effective implementation of the UN Security Council’s Resolution concerned.
The fact that at the meeting of G7 ministers of foreign affairs in 2018 the European Union selected Bosnia and Herzegovina for its partner within the “G7 Partner Initiative Women, Peace, and Security” supports the claim on the successful implementation of the UN Resolution 1325 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is yet another instance of recognition of the positive experience of our country on the issue concerned.
The experience and specific results achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina have been recognized at the international level, too. Thus, the national action plans of Finland, Moldova, and Albania were created following the model of the Action Plan on the UN Resolution 1325 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The implementation of the UN Resolution 1325 is just one segment of the regional cooperation between the institutional mechanisms for gender equality in the Western Balkans’ countries. In 2005, Bosnia and Herzegovina started its regional cooperation in the area of gender equality by signing the Regional Declaration on Cooperation of Institutional Mechanisms for Gender Issues in the Western Balkans. At that time, the Regional Coordination Board of Institutional Mechanisms for Gender Equality was established. In this way, Bosnia and Herzegovina took a leadership role in the implementation of a continued regional cooperation.
All data provided by the relevant institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and continuous adoption of the policy and necessary strategies have indicated that our country has expressed commitment to the improvement of a position of women and girls in the society, to their empowerment, as well as to gender equality in all areas of our society. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s cooperation with UN Women and with the UN Trust Fund alike have opened up the path leading to a systemic resolution of the issue of gender-based violence.
A continued support the UN Women and the UNN Trust Fund have provided to us is of a huge importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina, for a continuation of both the good practice and cooperation between the countries in the region, as well as for a contribution to the preservation of peace and good partnership relations alike.
The fact is that there is still a lot of work that we need to do. Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to undergo a process of maturing and implementing the specific reforms in order to address adequately all the challenges it faces. The prejudices faced by the Bosnian and Herzegovinian society should not be an obstacle to a further progress and harmonization of our standards with the international ones, or to a necessary harmonization with the Gender Equality Act.
We should all strive to achieve equality of all our male and female citizens through affirming the values of democratic societies. Although there are examples of women who have significantly contributed to our social spheres, including politics, education, economics or the armed forces, the representation quota of women at the leadership positions has remained low. We have to change that. It is necessary to include as many women as possible in the social and political spheres of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian society, as well as in the reform-focused processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a shared responsibility for all of us to work more intensively on the gender equality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as on creating an environment which will be as conductive as possible for all to be equal and enjoy equal rights.
Finally, let me point out that the activities related to the process of Euro-Atlantic integrations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the harmonization of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian social and political system with the European legal tradition should be in the focus of our attention. The implementation of the strategically important reforms and measures will, ultimately, lead to creating a more conductive environment for the implementation of progress in all spheres of our society.
I am convinced that this Global Convention session, which gathered a significant number of participants from the East European and other countries, will contribute to experience sharing and enhancement of mechanisms needed for a more successful fight against violence against women and girls.,
I hereby extend my welcome to all of you to Sarajevo and to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I wish the Convention a successful work.
Thank you for your attention."

Dear Mayor Skaka, and Ambassador Kozarić,
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen!
First of all, let me extend my thanks to the organizer for the invitation to this discussion about our Bosnia and Herzegovina tonight in Vienna, the discussion about those parts of history from which it can be seen that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not some new creation established, thanks to the great powers' will, at the end of the previous century in Dayton, but that it was a state indeed even when most of today's states did not exist.
The colleagues who already delivered their speeches tonight referred to the past and the historical facts. To know and respect the past of one's country is often one of the key conditions for discussing adequately the present, and even the future, or a mechanism necessary for making correct estimates of current, as well as future relations in a certain country.
I do not refer here to the political relations only, which have often been both shaped and channelled by our history in our regions. I also refer hereby to the wider societal relations and processes which unfold in the society itself, sometimes completely independently from the political relations. While appreciating the importance of history and historical facts, I would, however, want to avail myself of this opportunity to share my standpoints on a few issues which are related to the present, as well as to the future of our homeland.
Let me be honest with you: it is not easy to say what is the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina if that future is turned over to others, while expecting that they will take better care of us and of Bosnia and Herzegovina than we ourselves should do, if we expect that others do care more about Bosnia and Herzegovina, that they love or respect it more than we do.
No one knows what tomorrow brings. However, we can at least be certain on what we wish, what we want, and what we are trying to do with our lives and with our country.
I believe that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the future of us - Bosnians and Herzegovinians will be exactly the one we stand up for. It will be such future we stand up for, and not the one someone else does so.
Personally, I do not believe that effort invested or commitments made can be in vain, that they are futile, that they do not cause any effect.
Let us just remember the effort, commitment, hopes, sacrifice, belief in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the self-confidence of those who gave their lives for our homeland, the state we have today.
It is not perfect, not ideal, not as we imagined it. However, we have it and it is ours, no matter how it is like.
I would not want this brief address to turn into various phrases on integration processes, the phrases you listened to way too often yourselves. I believe that all of us know too well what our key state-focused priorities are, what our desired direction is, and which memberships we want to be granted.
It is my opinion that, while taking our history into consideration, and I already said that it was necessary to be familiar with one's history in order to be able to make correct decisions in today's world, i.e. such decisions which will be beneficial to the future generations in our country, too, and while having in mind elementary and basic human need for security and stability, it is most important now for both ourselves individually and thus for our country BiH to ensure a full membership in the NATO Alliance.
If it is necessary to explain this logic in detail to anyone, and how one reaches such conclusion, I remain available to elaborate on it.
While talking about effort, sacrifice, belief in oneself, hopes, let me mention one of us - Bosnians and Herzegovinians. He showed to us that all this pays off, that efforts invested bring about results relatively quickly, that effort, sacrifice, and belief in oneself are predestined to succeed. Let me, therefore, mention Amel Tuka hereafter. The success of this young athlete, who possesses all these features, made all of us extremely happy some ten days ago.
Imagine, then, how many more people like Amel are there in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the people who do not think about quitting after the first or the second obstacle. They are our future, and it is for them that we must fight. We should not lose hope that everyone who want to live a decent life and earn for living by their work can achieve great success like the one achieved by our Amel Tuka. We live amongst such people. I do believe in such people, and really think that there are many more of them than it may seem to us.
The fact is that a high number of young people left our country, and it sometimes projects a gloomy image of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, we cannot just mourn over such facts on departures. I do not accept that we lost the people who left the country. In fact, if it was true that they were lost for our country then I would not have been standing before you here today. You have not disconnected yourselves from your homeland, nor will you, I am sure of it, disconnect from it ever.
There is a lot we can do together. All that we do through cooperation, primarily in the area of economics, is the highest possible form of loyalty to our Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Therefore, I believe that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in ever more intense cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnians and Herzegovinians in any place where they may be today, including Austria.
In this way we will neither lose our identity nor culture. Instead, we will enhance both our identity and culture further.
We knew 830 years ago how to trade and make bilateral agreements, and the Charter of Kulin Ban is an evidence that we did so indeed. Consequently, we will know how to do trade and make bilateral agreements in the future, too.
As long as there are Bosnians and Herzegovinians who love their homeland and wish to advance it, the future of this country cannot be taken away from us by anyone.
Thank you for your attention."
86036,"Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Željko Komšić, at the General Debate of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=86036&langTag=en-US,2019-09-25,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President Muhammad-Bande, please allow me to first of all congratulate you on your election as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. I will also take the opportunity to thank Mrs. Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garcia, the previous President of the General Assembly.
I would like to emphasize the importance of the current moment. Amidst quite complex political and geopolitical circumstances, we will next year celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. This organization has faced numerous challenges in the past. I believe that United Nations General Assembly sessions have always been an opportunity to bring together leaders of different countries and share opinions and views on the world situation and, in particular, to find optimal solutions to contemporary global challenges and problems.
In that respect, the United Nations have also faced escalation of conflicts in different areas in 2019, including a major migrant and refugee crisis, followed by terrorism and violent extremism, as well as other forms of violence perpetrated by various extremist groups. There is also the issue of implementation of the Agenda for Sustainable Economic Growth and Sustainable Development, which will be discussed at this session as well.
Mr. President,
United Nations established the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development as a platform where political leaders agree on recommendations regarding the sustainable development matters. This year’s Forum session was held in July 2019, where my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time presented the Voluntary National Review (VNR) as part of monitoring of the implementation of sustainable development goals in the country, thus sharing our experiences in accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
By adopting the 2030 Agenda, Bosnia and Herzegovina has committed itself to initiating a systematic monitoring and supervision process for the implementation of this global agenda that integrates the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development. Bosnia and Herzegovina takes the view that the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires an agreement on foreseeable, coherent and sufficient funding to achieve sustainable development goals.
For these reasons, we believe that the achievement of the 2030 Agenda goals should strongly and qualitatively contribute to eradication of poverty, reduction of world hunger, protection of the environment, and handling of the evident climate changes. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development and its transformative nature as an opportunity and a mechanism of change aiming to comprehensively promote the social, economic and environmental aspects of the life of population. We therefore hope that the Review of Implementation Activities for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be finalized by the end of 2019 and submitted to the High-level Political Forum to be held in the coming years.
Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that the present time offers a special opportunity to change the course of development by creating a self-sustaining environment that will benefit everyone. It is a great honor for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be a part of this transformational Agenda as a sovereign country and provide our contribution within the worldwide countries family. Successful cooperation with the United Nations encourages our implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which presents an opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina to share our own experience, lessons learned, as well as challenges and practices on important life issues with the other United Nations member states and contribute towards strengthening of the international cooperation.
Mr. President,
Activities related to the Euro-Atlantic integration process in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the alignment of the BiH socio-political system with the EU acquis communautaire, are at the center of political developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the country is committed to continuing its activities to stabilize the situation and accelerate the initiated reform processes. The European Commission’s Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application is a very accurate record of all the reforms required. Some of the reforms require the voidance and annulment of the existing systemic discrimination against the citizens of my country, which, unfortunately, is set out in certain provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as provisions of various legislative acts. Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to undergo a process of maturation in order to reach such a political level that those necessary reforms can be implemented without major socio-political strains.
Furthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively contributing to regional security efforts in our region. In that respect, I would like to assure you that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a reliable, serious and determined partner to the United Nations, the European Union and NATO. We are particularly determined to strengthen the European security area, committed to fight organized crime, combat terrorism and violent extremism, as well as illegal migration, and to protect the security of national borders in terms of migration management. With regard to international challenges of the modern times, Bosnia and Herzegovina particularly emphasizes its commitment to global efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism.
Mr. President,
In addition to internal reforms, Bosnia and Herzegovina also focuses on strengthening regional co-operation, especially when it comes to infrastructure projects in the communications, transport and energy sectors. Internationally, Bosnia and Herzegovina is active within the United Nations and organizations such as the OSCE, the Council of Europe, CEFTA, and other various regional initiatives. We would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina in the previous period had a prominent and active chairmanship of the SEECP regional initiative and MARRI, where it invested additional efforts and provided an active impetus to the regional approach to facing current challenges.
Bilateral relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighboring countries are at the top of our foreign policy priorities. That should be the foundation for continuous improvement of cooperation based on mutual interest and the principle of equality, respect for one another and respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity. The above might lead to conclusion that the relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighboring countries are good and intensive. However, due to particular policies of our neighbors, we occasionally witness their activities aimed at realization of their own political interests within Bosnia and Herzegovina. That causes unrest and produces a degree of destabilization in my country, which is neither good, nor does it contribute to development of the desired good neighborly relations.
Mr. President,
The United Nations has primary responsibility for world peace and security. One should not lose sight of the interactive interdependence and complexity of the relationship between peace and security, development and cooperation and especially the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. With the increasing number of conflicts becoming progressively more complex, we are aware that the United Nations is facing a number of challenges, especially on the African continent and the Middle East. In order to find an adequate solution to numerous crises, Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the United Nations efforts to strengthen the preventive diplomacy sector within the political affairs department. It is of particular importance that all disputes be resolved peacefully, as stated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, which expressly requires that disputes be resolved peacefully and with good will to resolve them. United Nations and Security Council resolutions represent one form of support for such peaceful settlement of various disputes between the countries.
Bosnia and Herzegovina continuously monitors these phenomena and, to the best of its ability, strengthens its capacities in the fight against terrorism, international crime and narcotics production and trafficking, as well as trafficking in human beings occurring within the framework of migration movements. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly condemns violent extremism and terrorism in all its forms, and finds all acts of extremism and terrorism, regardless of their form, motivation and perpetrators, to be criminal and unjustifiable. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the full implementation of all UN Security Council resolutions aimed at bringing persons involved in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts to justice.
Mr. President,
Bearing in mind the direct correlation between security and sustainable development and the central role the United Nations has in the process of peacebuilding and the creation of basic conditions for the development of post-conflict societies, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the United Nations’ direct activities in stabilizing post-conflict societies by building and strengthening institutions, especially those in the field of the rule of law, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, security, reintegration and reconciliation processes.
Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses its concern about the ongoing escalation of violence in the world, especially in the Middle East, and I take this opportunity to call for an end of combat activities and for the finding of peaceful solutions. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a principled view that the protection of civilians, respect for human rights and humanitarian law are a necessary priority in international relations.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's foreign policy is focused on maintaining and promoting lasting peace and security in all parts of the world. The activities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of international relations are based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and other Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe documents, as well as generally accepted principles of international law. Bosnia and Herzegovina has either ratified or successively taken on the most significant international documents in this field and is ready for full cooperation with other countries, both within relevant multilateral organizations and initiatives, as well as bilaterally, in order to effectively combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of deployment.
Bosnia and Herzegovina also advocates all general positions in terms of promoting and supporting all realistic and effective ideas that will lead to the ultimate goal, which is the world without nuclear weapons.
In accordance with the obligations arising from the provisions of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, regarding the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of transport, Bosnia and Herzegovina is focused on fulfilling its commitments with an emphasis on strengthening dialogue and non-proliferation cooperation on mass destruction as well as various forms of regional cooperation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina explicitly opposes provision of any support to non-state actors and entities seeking to develop, procure, produce, possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their means of transfer. Furthermore, we actively and directly contribute to the United Nations peacekeeping missions, one of the most visible components of the United Nations. As a sovereign country that attaches particular importance to peacekeeping missions, Bosnia and Herzegovina best demonstrates its participation and commitment to peacekeeping through its involvement in United Nations and NATO peacekeeping missions. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the commitment of the United Nations to support the participation of women in peacekeeping missions. I would like to point out with particular pleasure that we are one of the few countries that has been fulfilling its stated goals for a long time, that is, over 20% of women participating in peacekeeping missions.
Mr. President,
I would particularly like to point out that the Agreement on Suppression of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse was signed on January 10, 2019 between the United Nations and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which obliged my country to hold everyone responsible, whether civilian or uniformed, for all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping or other humanitarian operations, including support for a zero tolerance policy towards this type of deviant behavior.
International legal framework is the starting point to exercise the rights of a child, and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child is the fundamental instrument to determine the legal framework and policies of the countries that are the Parties to the Convention, which focus on addressing the issues of the rights of a child. The Country Programme 2015 - 2019 between UNICEF and Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly important as it further contributes to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as the Development Agenda for the period after 2015.
Racial discrimination, as well as other forms of discrimination, is insufficiently regulated by the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Still, these deviant phenomena are referenced through several features of criminal offenses within the criminal legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as lower levels of government. That clearly expresses the commitment of the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to respect the human rights of all citizens who live there, as well as permanently resident aliens or aliens granted temporary residence on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with respect to all principles of mutual tolerance. However, as I said earlier, certain provisions providing for systemic discrimination remain in the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as established in the four judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in the Sejdić-Finci, Zornić, Pilav and Šlak cases, as well as the European Commission’s Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application. Bosnia and Herzegovina must provide for constitutional reforms as well as reforms of various laws in order to meet the European standard, which is the equality of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in all aspects of life. Such action will require the agreement of domestic political actors to remove obstacles to the continuation of the process of integration into the European Union.
In the area of ​​trafficking in human beings, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period 2016-2019 aims to improve the support system for combating trafficking in human beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will further modernize this plan and prepare a new one for the coming period.
Mr. President,
The rule of law and international law are firmly established in the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, which is the very foundation of this organization. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to promoting the rule of law at all levels - national, regional and international, and firmly committed to contributing towards the building, strengthening and full respect of international law, including human rights and international humanitarian law. Therefore, I would like to assure you that Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to respecting its international obligations. That is very important for our contribution to the comprehensive development, preservation and maintenance of peace, and the promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms and sustainable development.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal Residual Mechanism, which has taken over functions from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, including judicial functions, enforcement of sanctions, relocation of released individuals and protection of victims and witnesses. The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain committed to ensuring that all persons suspected of war crimes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia must be brought to justice.
Bosnia and Herzegovina hereby reaffirms its commitment to continue negotiations on United Nations reform in accordance with the final document of the 2005 New York World Summit of Heads of State and Government. Reform of the United Nations system is necessary, but such reform must be carried out with extreme care and broadest consensus of the Member States. Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the view that developing countries are underrepresented in the Security Council, which is an appropriate point to hear and discuss the specific issues and problems of developing countries.
Given the sensitivity of the issue, Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to reaching a compromise solution. Given that the number of Eastern European countries has more than doubled, we expect that the reformed Security Council will be expanded with additional seats for non-permanent members of the Eastern European group of countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina also supports greater representation of African countries, as well as small and medium-developed countries, including the small island countries.
Thank you Mr. President."
85917,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić during the award ceremony “The Honorary Citizen of the Bosanska Krupa Municipality “,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85917&langTag=en-US,2019-09-17,"Dear citizens of Bosanska Krupa, dear Mayor! I am honoured that on the occasion of the Bosanska Krupa Municipality Day, I can receive the “Honorary Citizen of Bosanska Krupa Municipality” award. I take the opportunity to thank you all for this honour.
It is my particular pleasure to receive recognition on the day of the liberation of Bosanska Krupa from the aggressor. To this day, members of the Fifth Corps, or members of the 511st Famous Brigade, liberated this city through a masterful action as part of the Operation Sana 95 and made the enemy of the state panic.
The enemy left a devastated and looted city behind. However, the town's citizens who love the town and who love this country raised Bosanska Krupa to its feet again. That is why I am glad to see that Bosanska Krupa lives its life, and not the one intended by its aggressor.
Therefore, the aggressor failed in his goal. His goal will remain unfathomable permanently, but our goals are still alive. More alive than ever. Just in this town, last year, during the election campaign, I spoke about the goals of us who love and fight for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the time I said that we must maintain faith in the idea of ​​the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Now I will repeat the same thing I said then.
The day we stop believing in the idea of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the day we will lose this kind of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Do not let them kill our idea of a Republic, a democracy we cherished amongst ourselves, even when political parties did not exist. We politicians need to constantly be highlighting it as the fundamental value of politics and our Bosnian-Herzegovinian society. Let's stop just talking in our own and the name of our close ones, let's stop listening just to ourselves and our close ones. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a republic, will again be a society in which we are open to everyone, as we once were. I believe in this and that is why I am in politics.
The idea of ​​the Republic is not one's private or party property, but the first-of-its-kind legacy of the vision of the civil state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It does not belong to one people, nation or religion, but to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who feel this country their own, as well as those who are no longer among us.
This idea is worth advocating in every possible way, and we show our best commitment by preserving peace. Peace is, in fact, our only weapon. It is the weapon which those who seek to undermine the sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, inventing some other sovereignties, will succumb to. We are not in a hurry as much as they were to tear down the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There's a common saying: All things come to those who wait.
We are facing a struggle through peaceful political means to advance Bosnia and Herzegovina through the necessary reforms and make it a modern state for all its citizens, by joining the larger security, political and economic systems.
Allow me once again to thank you for this honour.
Thank you."
85839,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić gave speech at the (Royal College of Defence Studies as part of the working visit to the United Kingdom,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85839&langTag=en-US,2019-09-10,"Dear Soldiers, Officers, Government Officers, Ladies and Gentlemen! It is a special honour for me to address you today as Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as a former soldier of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is almost no greater honour in public engagement than to serve your country militarily, and when you have noble and civil intentions, that honour is even greater. Indeed, it is a nice feeling to know that you have fought for justice, freedom and peace, against injustice, tyranny and terror. When you pursue such noble goals, no one can take away that feeling.
I am particularly pleased to say this here before you, who are proudly serving our friendly country, the United Kingdom, a NATO member state, the same alliance of countries in the interest of maintaining peace and stability in the world, and to whom we in Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite numerous resistances, we strive. Among those present here are also people who come from other countries in order to deepen the knowledge in this elite institution. I believe that your goals are the same as ours, namely collective security, the rule of law, democracy, freedom.
I wish to highlight on this occasion that the friendship between the peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Kingdom is not recent. It was built a long time ago, through a common struggle and commitment to what are true civic and democratic values, through the struggle between civilization and anti-civilization, through the glorious struggle and sacrifices our citizens endured in the fight against fascism in World War II.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens do not forget their friends easily especially since though they had not done any harm to anyone, they have had many enemies throughout their history.
All of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina know very well how the support of the United Kingdom has been in the moments of statehood and global fascism. Brigadier General Fitzroy Maclean did not randomly fall from the sky in the small town of Drvar in September 1943, but, at Churchill's request, descended a parachute to Tito's headquarters near Drvar, to help, on behalf of your country, the heroic struggle of our partisans who fought for our state, and against our then common enemy. Together they planned coordinated actions by the partisan army and allied aviation to prevent the enemy from regrouping in Central and Western Europe, which would further prolong the war.
It is no wonder, therefore, that Britain was the first to see who in our region fought for the same goals and against the same enemy. For this reason, but not only for this reason, the friendship between our countries is a permanent category. We were on the same, or on the right side of history, and that, I am convinced, will remain so in the future.
Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to be part of a community of states and security systems that want peace in the world. I've said it before, but just because of the importance of it, I keep saying it. We are grateful to the United Kingdom for the efforts made since the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement. These peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina have not failed. Thanks to British troops coming to the BiH peacekeeping mission, our country is stable today. However, we want it to be even more stable. That is why we greatly appreciate the support the United Kingdom is providing to Bosnia and Herzegovina on its path to NATO integration.
We will not be distracted from this path by troublemakers whose goals are not in the interest of peace, who spread unrest even in Britain, regardless how hard they may be trying. I will not mention their names, because we in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the UK know very well who they are. We are on the threshold of the 70th anniversary of the NATO Pact, which has brought lasting peace, security and prosperity to much of Europe. It is time for the process to be completed and rounded by incorporating the remaining countries that have publically declared for NATO membership, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is therefore necessary to further strengthen the bilateral ties of our countries in the coming period. The foundation for that, as I said, is long overdue. In the changed geopolitical circumstances in the world, cooperation between our countries, both political and economic as well as military, is both essential, necessary and mutually beneficial. For my part, I will do my utmost to strengthen this cooperation and further expand it at each of the levels mentioned. In this context, I take this opportunity to express my satisfaction with the engagement of the United Kingdom Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, His Excellency Matthew Field, who is a true friend of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all its citizens.
Finally, dear attendees, I would like to say the following; Only the names of heroes, whether soldiers, officers, diplomats or statesmen, remain written in history. I want you to be honoured with the merit of peace, because peace is the most sacred thing we need to protect today, in the name of the future. That is the victory we must strive for.
Thank you."
85608,"Speech by Željko Komšić, Chairman of BiH Presidency within the central programme of the “Defence of BiH - Igman 2019” event",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85608&langTag=en-US,2019-08-02,"Esteemed families of the shaheeds and the fallen soldiers, Disabled military veterans, Veterans of the Army and the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of BiH, the defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Dear President Džaferović, Minister Bukvarević, Minister Jusko, ladies and gentlemen!
Today, at this place, the place which was essential for the defence of Sarajevo and out entire homeland, we remember those who, by superhuman efforts, by their hearts and souls, went to the battle and laid down their lives for our country’s freedom.
Today we remember the heroic times.
This territory was crucial for the defence of Sarajevo, and we all know all too well what would have happened if Igman fell. Namely, it is questionable how the war would have ended in that case.
Thanks to the courageous people who were fighting back then at this territory, Igman was defended, Sarajevo was defended, and Bosnia and Herzegovina was defended.
The enemies did not succeed in killing the heart of this state which was already wounded. They knew that the one who held Sarajevo controlled the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, they failed in fulfilling their intentions.
Those who are not with us today sacrificed themselves and prevented them in such an endeavour.
We should never forget it!
Therefore, we need to tell the truth on what happened in BiH. Actually, it was indeed the conflict between the civilization and the anti-civilization.
We, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, defended the true civilizational values and democratic norms, whereas all others, and let this statement be understood in any way anyone wants to understand it, discarded and rejected such values, and the history is yet to give its judgment on it.
Therefore, we do send a message to them from this place that they should not be threatening us. We defended the state with not much more than our bare hands, while they had at their disposal the facilities built up for fifty years in the military industry.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and her citizens have their past, their present, and will have their future, and that future will be without false compromises, without divisions, false policies, and without those who have acted openly against Bosnia and Herzegovina and her citizens.
Ensuring such a future is the obligation of all of us!
Our young generations have not carried the burden of the past as we have done so. Despite the evil which befell us, we should teach them not to hate. However, we also must tell them the truth on what happened during the past war in BiH.
The truth which has been confirmed by the whole world, that very world which witnessed the horrors which befell BiH. We should not allow any Yutel-like delusions re-occur, nor should we allow that it is believed again that our destiny is in the hands of others, that it depends on the good will of others. No, it does not! Our destiny depends upon ourselves, and ourselves only, as well as on the past lessons we learnt.
Therefore, I am, once again, inviting those who have been trying to forge the truth: do not do it! Do not do it for the sake of these young people to whom we are obligated to ensure both peaceful and safe future.
Let us not conduct mutual battles when we already won one, which we did not ask for in the first place.
Do not let your own or the interests of others lead you in your endeavours. Do work instead in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all her citizens. The interests of all the citizens include peace, stability and prosperity. Do not think that there is no war conducted nowadays against BiH. That current war is silent, treacherous, and ruthless.
The more quiet, treacherous or ruthless that war is, the firmer our obligation is to be as loud as possible. And let us tell them: “Listen, ladies and gentlemen, in this country or outside it, no generation of Bosnians and Herzegovinians has been born or lived, nor shall it be born, who would be ready to let this country die, either with the roar of canons and army tanks or quietly and voicelessly.
Thank you."
85646,"Address by Šefik Džaferović, BiH Presidency member at the opening ceremony of “The Defence of BiH - Igman 2019“ event",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85646&langTag=en-US,2019-08-01,"Dear BiH Presidency Chairman, Esteemed members of the shaheed families and the families of the fallen soldiers, Esteemed disabled military veterans, Esteemed members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Esteemed representatives of all administrative levels!
A two-day event “The Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina – Igman 2019“ starts today, marking our memory of the battle of Igman, one of the most important battles during the defence against the aggression.
These are the days when we recall the glorious victory of the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which took place in the summer of 1993 on the Igman mountain. This victory was of essential importance for the defence of the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as for the defence and survival of the entire country.
The aim of the aggressor forces was to take Igman and cut off the final landline which was connecting Sarajevo with the rest of the free territories, and, ultimately, with the rest of the world. If the aggressor succeeded in this intention, then the siege which curtailed and strangled the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the beginning of the aggression would have been fully rounded. That would have had huge, probably substantial consequences as eventual cutting off of the communication by land between Sarajevo and the rest of the country would have been irrecoverable from both military and strategic perspectives.
Thanks to the heroic efforts of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina's soldiers, the aggressor was brought to its knees and prevented from achieving its objectives. With many times more arms and supplies, the Greater Serbian aggressor tried to break the backbone of defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Igman Mountain. However, in the end, the aggressor broke its own teeth instead. The Army of RBiH demonstrated its glorious strength.
In the course of these days back then, the history re-confirmed that there is nothing stronger than an army of honourable people who are fighting for a right cause.
The aggressor forces had both infamous and criminal aims. Their goal was to break down Bosnia and Herzegovina, while destroying the Bosniak people and all BiH patriots respectively. It was established by the judgments passed by the highest instances of international justice that their fight was marked with the breaches of the international law, as well as of the rules and customs of warfare. It was, to put it simply, the joint criminal enterprise.
On the other hand, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was fighting for the noblest aims, which included defending and preserving Bosnia and Herzegovina, and defending of the Bosniak people against the genocide. From 1992 to 1995, the Army of the Republic of BiH, as the only legal military formation in the territory of BiH, was defending the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the right of the Bosniak people and all BiH patriots to survival.
Parallel to this, the RBiH Army, in the mountains of Igman and other fierce battlefields throughout BiH, was the only one in the period from 1992 to 1995 that defended the basic values of the free, democratic world and elementary civilizational principles, including the idea woven into the core of Bosnia and Herzegovina – the idea that the people of different ethnic or religious affiliations can live together.
Thanks to our aim being the righteous one, Bosnia and Herzegovina was preserved and defended. If they managed to convince us, and then the rest of the world as well, that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a land of hatred, and that her peoples could not live together, this country would not have had a chance to survive. The crime perpetrators failed in destroying the civilizational idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They will never be able to succeed in their cause because we will never allow them to do that.
All those who, during the aggression, tried to destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been trying to do the same now with their followers and successors, this time hidden under various disguise, in a perfidious way, not by the military means any more, but by the political ones.
The options we were faced with had never been choosing between war and peace, confrontation or cooperation, but between fight and surrender, between freedom and slavery. It was like that in 1992. It is like that now, too. We have always chosen to fight, and today it is a political fight on which the destiny of this country depends. Therefore, it is important to create and strengthen the awareness on the need of defending the country because a unity of this country's patriots is the only guarantee of its preservation.
Tomorrow is the day when the veterans of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from all parts of the country will gather on Igman to recall the memories from the summer of 1993, and inform the young generations on the most difficult times in the history of our country, when both the state and the freedom were defended.
“The Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina – Igman 2019“ event starts here, in this special place, with the shaheeds.
We are here today to pay respects to all fallen soldiers of the Army of the Republic of BiH, to the best sons of this country. If it were not for their sacrifice and readiness to, at all costs, including the cost of their own lives, defend Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have existed now.
Therefore, we will never forget the sacrifice of the shaheeds and the fallen soldiers of the Army of the Republic of BIH, and we will teach the new generations about it because it is by studying the truth on the period of aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina that one can understand most fully the essence of the current political processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A special message that I would like to send from this place today is the one on the importance of caring for the families of the shaheeds and the fallen soldiers. The debt with which our shaheeds and the fallen soldiers of the Army of RBiH indebted us is not reimbursable ever because their sacrifice is that huge. However, we need to keep returning that debt all the time, while working on protecting the rights of the families of the shaheeds and the fallen soldiers. We have done that all these years since the war ended, in accordance with our possibilities. We will continue doing this in the future, too.
The representatives of the state, the holders of office at all administrative levels, must have this in mind every day as their obligation and homework, and they should never fail in availing themselves of the opportunity to provide support and assistance to the families of the best sons of this country.
Thank you."

On this occasion the BiH Presidency Chairman laid wreaths on the Brezovača m",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85581&langTag=en-US,2019-07-30,"“Dear family members, friends, fellow soldiers, and all who respect Čedomir Domuz and Smajo Soma and their deeds,
We have gathered here in Igman today to pay respects at the Brezovača memorial to our Golden Lilies Čedo and Smajo. Unfortunately, they have not been with us for 27 years now. We have all missed them, and those who have missed them most are, I know, their children and families.
It is precisely because of their children and other family members that we must not forget what Čedo and Smajo did for the defense of Igman from the key moments of organising defense until their premature and tragic death in the operation of liberation of Trnovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They were both uncomplicated and good people who loved their city, their homeland, and its people. When the war started, they disregarded any consequences and fought, together with their fellow soldiers, for Bosnia and Herzegovina's freedom, for the freedom of all of us living in this country.
I find it painful when no sufficient credit is given to the people like Čedomir and Smajo for what they did. We should not allow their sacrifice, or the sacrifice of all courageous people who lost their lives during the past war, to become futile.
Insufficient attention has been paid to their families, their children. Their children, such as Čedo's ones, are adults. Today, by their knowledge, efforts and work they contribute to a better Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus defying those who would still it to be different from that.
Therefore, we must not forget Čedo and Smajo. We should not forget the people who laid down their lives to defend Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the people who enabled us to live in peace today. They are heroes of both difficult and critical times in the history of our country, and for that we are indebted and will be eternally grateful to them.“"
85533,BiH Presidency Member Šefik Džaferović attended the opening of the shaheed memorial in Žepa and marking the fall of the UN “Safe Area” 24 years ago,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85533&langTag=en-US,2019-07-27,"Esteemed members of the shaheed families, Esteemed members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dear all originating from Žepa,
We are marking today the completion of the construction of the shaheed memorial in Žepa, which will always remind us of the most difficult days in the history of this area, and of the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are also paying respects today to the best sons of this country because Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have existed today if it were not for them. We will never forget what happened to this country and to our people during the aggression from 1992 to 1995. We will teach the future generations about it because oblivion is dangerous. The one who forgets takes a risk that evil will be done against him again.
It is with sadness that we remember the 453 Bosniaks, who were killed by the aggressor forces during the three and a half years of the siege of Žepa, and in the last days of July 1995. We also remember more than one thousand people who were taken from Žepa to the detention camps back then. They were taken to the camps in the occupied territory, as well as in the territory of the neighbouring Serbia, where they were held in detention even long after the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed.
On July 27, 1995, which was precisely 24 years ago, there was not a single Bosniak left in Žepa. The death squads of Ratko Mladić started the systemic looting and destruction of the Bosniak houses on that day, and, at the end of it, they also destroyed the mosque. They wanted to remove the traces of our existence in this area, in the Podrinje region of ours, which was one of the goals of the Greater Serbian aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There is also an opportunity today to recall the shameful role of the UN Ukrainian battalion which, without any resistance, handed over the “protected area“ to the Mladić' units. By doing so, they betrayed the people of Žepa, and blatantly deceived their own mandate, which had been given to them by the United Nations.
By handing over the “protected area“ which was declared safe by the Security Council, the highest ranking body in charge of international security, the international community and the United Nations lost their credibility in the eyes of many around the world, and have not managed to restore it to date.
One of the numerous activities which contributed to this was the UN approval to Mladić' army first to kidnap, within the UNPROFOR base in Žepa, and then shoot dead Avdo Palić, Commander of the Žepa Brigade of the Army of RBiH, as well as the members of the war leadership of Žepa, including Mehmed Hajrić, and Amir Imamović. The fact that the UN forces handed over the delegation consisting of legitimate authorities to the hands of the war criminals, and the fact that they did it during the peace negotiations, will remain an unprecedented act, and a permanent shame of the UN.
Žepa is a symbol of suffering in our collective memory. However, Žepa is also a symbol of resistance. From the very start of the aggression, the people of this area resisted and opposed heroically against the fierce attacks of the aggressor armada, and they were doing so throughout the three years of the siege.
Žepa was the last refuge to thousands of refugees from the surrounding areas, and it was only thanks to Žepa that thousands of people managed to survive. The heroes of the Žepa Brigade of the Army of the Republic of BiH, led by their commander Avdo Palić, are those who who deserve credit for this, and we will never forget their deeds.
The restored houses and the returnee community in Žepa have testified that the aggressor, although committing the most horrific crimes, has not succeeded after all. The perpetrators of crime dreamed about it that there would be no Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, it survived and has grown stronger despite such aspirations. They also dreamt about removing Bosniaks altogether. However, the Bosniaks survived and have grown stronger.
Every day, since the Dayton agreement was signed, there has been more and more of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has contributed to the anti-state forces' panicking. By their ongoing attempts to erode this country, to undermine its foundations, or at least obstruct its development, they have constantly reminded us of their intentions. However, they should know that they will never succeed in their endeavours.
We will never give in under the pressure of those who do not wish well to this country and its citizens, and we will continue to fight for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which each person should have equal rights at each inch of its territory.
You, the returnees, are amongst the greatest heroes in the fight for the state in the times of peace. The process of return has a crucial importance in reconstruction and restoration of the state. The policy of division of Bosnia and Herzegovina was marked with the expulsion of people from their homes. Therefore, there is no better way to oppose such policy than by return of the people to their homes.
Both economic and financial state resources have increased constantly. Investment in returnee communities and support to returnees, particularly the young ones, must be a strategic commitment of all administrative levels. All returnees deserve to have access to security, housing, as well as to jobs in order to ensure a decent life to themselves and their families. I will continue to advocate strongly, through the institution of the Presidency of BiH, and urge for intensifying the programmes which will be directed to further enhancement of the status and the rights of returnees in all parts of BiH.
A united and democratic state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, member of the European Union and NATO Alliance alike, has remained our goal. I have no doubt that we will reach that goal by committed work. However, our development will not only be measured by the results we manage to achieve in the area of economics or through large construction projects. Our success will primarily be measured by and depending on the quality of life of those who live in the borderline, returnee places, most remote from the centres. We must have this in mind every day, while working devotedly and sincerely in order to ensure a peaceful and prosperous future to the state and the new generations alike.
Thank you."
85382,"Address by Šefik Džaferović, BiH Presidency member at the commemoration marking the 24th anniversary of the genocide committed in Srebrenica, July 11th, 2019",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85382&langTag=en-US,2019-07-11,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, esteemed families of the victims of genocide, dear friends from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, who have shared pain and sorrow with us, while demonstrating piety in remembering the innocent victims of the genocide committed in Srebrenica,
We gathered here today to lay to rest the mortal remains of 33 people, the 33 people who were innocent!
To whom and of what the 16-year old boy Osman Cvrk can be guilty? We will bury his mortal remains here today. To whom and of what all other children can be guilty? The white gravestones mark their graves in Potočari. What was the nature of quilt of Asim and Kasim Isakovic, the boys who were just coming of age? What was the guilt of Zaim Pilav and his son Fuad? What was the guilt of the 82-year old Šaha Cvrk, and all other old men and women who got killed? What wrong and to whom did all these victims do? These women, including the pregnant ones, the new-borns, the boys, the old men, the men who defended their families and bare lives were all killed in an excruciating way.
The reason for which they were killed was only one – they were Muslims, Bosniaks. That indeed was the sole and sufficient reason for the RS Army and RS Police death squadrons of Karadžić and Mladić, supported by the paramilitary units from Serbia to, in just a couple of days in July, in an organized and monstrous way, kill over 8.300 people. More than 1.000 people were killed daily. One innocent, helpless human being was killed almost each minute.
The goal was to exterminate one ethnic group in this area. The crime unfolded before the eyes of the whole world. By its resolution, the United Nations declared Srebrenica a safe zone. However, they did not, when they should have done so, make steps to prevent the gravest crime committed in Europe since the Second World War.
Srebrenica will always remain a dark stain on the conscience of all those who could have and but failed to prevent the genocide committed there. The UN officials recognized it years later. Unfortunately, the representatives of the international community still lack a more decisive reaction, this time to the genocide denial and glorification of the war crimes.
By failing to prevent genocide in the area the UN Security Council declared “a safe UN zone” the international community lost its credibility in the eyes of many around the world. The only chance for the United Nations and the international community to restore a part of its lost credibility is to decisively oppose those who deny the truth about the crime, and glorify its perpetrators.
In various forms, the crime unfolded against the victims of the genocide even after their death. In order to attempt to hide the crime, the victims’ bodies were additionally affected by the acts of acts of sacrilege for months after the genocide was committed. This was done by moving the mortal remains from one grave to another in order to hide them. The mortal remains of one person were sometimes found in two, three, even in four different graves. As the genocide was committed in an organized and systemic way, an attempt was made to hide the crime in a systemic and organized way subsequently.
A continuation of the crime against the victims, or at least complicity, we can indeed consider the silence due to which, even 24 years after the genocide, we have not found the bodies of all who were killed can be considered a continuation of the crime against the victims, or complicity to say the least. Over 1,700 victims have not been found or identified yet, they have not found their eternal peace, and they were not buried yet in a decent way worthy of human beings.
Therefore, I hereby re-iterate, as many did already in this context, an appeal to our neighbours: do disclose the locations of the mass graves, and thus ease the pain and suffering to the victims’ families! Help yourselves, find a grain of goodness in yourselves, and, at least partly, ease your conscience! Do not go around living with the thoughts that, around you, there are the hidden graves with the bodies of innocent people who were killed, while you remain silent. Do have in mind that, until their souls find peace, you will not be at peace with yourselves either.
We consider genocide denial and glorification of its perpetrators responsible for the crime special kinds of posthumous crimes committed against the victims. It was established scientifically that denial is the final phase of genocide.
Genocide has been denied despite the judgments passed by the International Court of Justice and The Hague Tribunal respectively. Having in mind the evidence on brutal killings, while clearly recognizing the aim to which the mass executions were committed, and faced with a distorted ideology which was driving the systemic and organized perpetration of the crimes, both international and domestic courts established, in the only way which is possible and correct, that the events of July 1995 constituted the crime of genocide.
Unfortunately, the political and religious elites of the Serb people have not wanted to accept these facts, they have refused to face the truth or distance themselves clearly from the ideology which created the genocide. They have not wanted to distance themselves from the specific perpetrators either, who were mainly sentenced to life or many years of imprisonment. They have done exactly the contrary – they have glorified them.
By genocide denial and glorification of the convicted war criminals they have not only insulted the victims and the victims’ families, but defied all civilized world, which knows what the truth is, and understands the meaning of the judgments passed by the international courts. Although they may not be aware of it, it is by such attitude that they have caused most harm to their own people, onto whom they have projected the guilt for the crimes driven by Milosevic’ and Karadzic’ policy.
The path they have followed is wrong. The right path would be to recognize the genocide was committed, accept the court judgments, clearly and unequivocally distance themselves from its creators and perpetrators alike, as well as from the ideology which created it. Further, they should support, together with us, passing of the law on banning genocide denial and glorification of war crimes. It is only in this way, on the basis of truth and by accepting the court judgments, that trust can be restored. We need such trust not only for our own sake, but for the sake of the future generations.
As for ourselves, we know our path indeed. We will keep insisting on justice to be done as long as it takes for the final perpetrator to get punished. And we will guard the truth. Nobody will be able to overpower that truth. In addition to the fact that it was written in the court judgments, which are historical facts, that truth is carved deeply into our collective consciousness.
It is carved in indeed as a warning!
The truth about the genocide committed in Srebrenica has been carved in permanently in the collective consciousness of the civilized world. Numerous commemorative events on genocide in many cities around the world, on all continents, have bear witness to that. Remembering Srebrenica has become a global event. Year after year, the Peace March is joined not only by the people originating from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but by those from all other parts of the world.
All of them are the guardians of the truth. I hereby extend my thanks to all of them for guarding the truth.
Dear friends,
The white gravestones in the Potočari valley, and this memorial centre have also bear witness to this. I hope that time will come shortly when we will find, identify, and bury all 8,372 victims, so that they and their families can find peace.
The years will follow when there will be no collective funerals in Potočari. This fact obligates us additionally to equip this memorial centre in terms of infrastructure, supplies, technical support, scientific capacity, and in all other necessary ways, so that it can continue its mission of guarding the truth on genocide.
We will keep visiting Potočari always. We will always remember the victims of genocide. However, it is our obligation to take care of restoration of life in this area, of the returnees who have lived in Srebrenica and throughout the entire Podrinje region.
They need to have security, housing, as well as jobs, which will enable them to provide for themselves and their children and live decently thanks to their own honourable work. The return to the Podrinje region, to the banks of the beautiful Drina river of ours, where we have always been residing on our own land, must be sustainable.
Much has been done already. More remains to be done. There have been some weaknesses, mainly when we were not united. However, it is up to all of us to contribute our maximum to committing ourselves with even more determination and focus, through special programmes, to enhancement of the status and the rights of the returnees in all parts of our country, and here in particular – in Srebrenica and the Podrinje region.
That is our debt to the innocent victims of the genocide committed in Srebrenica.
Thank you."
85325,"Address delivered by Šefik Džaferović, BiH Presidency member at SEECP Summit",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85325&langTag=en-US,2019-07-09,"Bosnia and Herzegovina has been strongly committed to the regional cooperation and policy of good neighbourly relations. It is committed to resolving inter-state disputes in a peaceful way, based on the respect for the international law. In addition to this, Bosnia and Herzegovina advocates dialogue as a means of identifying mutually acceptable solutions to all open issues. This kind of dialogue is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's key foreign policy priorities.
Dear Mr Chairman,
Your excellences, presidents, and prime ministers,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is both my honour and pleasure indeed that we can host you in Bosnia and Herzegovina at this year's Summit of the South-European Cooperation Process.
This platform was established 23 years ago in order to enhance the regional cooperation, security, and stability. In the previous period, all SEECP members achieved a significant progress in reaching their objectives. The processes of integration into the European Union and NATO alike have been of key importance for the future of our region, as well as for its security and progress. An improvement of relations in the region is necessary for joint actions on migration flows, the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, the fight against organized crime and illegal arms trade, the fight against cyber threats, as well as for the joint regional energy and transport policies respectively.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been strongly committed to the regional cooperation and policy of good neighbourly relations. It is committed to resolving inter-state disputes in a peaceful way, based on the respect for the international law. In addition to this, Bosnia and Herzegovina advocates dialogue as a means of identifying mutually acceptable solutions to all open issues. This kind of dialogue is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's key foreign policy priorities.
Our region is still faced with a number of challenges, including the ongoing migration crisis as the priority area of concern. The migration crisis has escalated in the last two years in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Facing the problem of migration crisis has indicated the weaknesses of both institutional capacities and regional cooperation. If we have in mind the fact that the migrants have arrived to this region, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the territory of the European Union, then it is clear that the focus of this issue cannot be put on the border between the EU and BiH only. Bosnia and Herzegovina has not caused such intensified migration processes, and thus cannot be solely responsible of resolving this issue. We expect the EU to provide both strategic and organizational support to the institutions of BiH, so that all challenges brought about by the migration crisis can be addressed efficiently.
The spread of organized crime and human trafficking respectively have made the situation even worse. The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina has considered the issue of cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbouring Montenegro and Serbia, aimed at supressing the ongoing human trafficking.
Inevitably, the jeopardized stability has reflected itself on the socio-economic situation, as well as on the overall social environment. Both political instability and disputes, as well as legal insecurity, have created the environment which is not conductive to economic growth.
Faced with an insufficient improvement of living standards, and with an uncertainty caused by the political instability, a significant portion of the young population have left to the Western European countries, which, have been faced with a demographic deficit and a need for a new labour force.
The challenges in the areas of security, economic development, migration crisis, or emigration of the young have been shared problems which can be overcome by joint solutions and regional initiatives only, aimed at enhancement of stability and economic cooperation alike.
One of the objectives of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process is improvement in the areas of judiciary and the rule of law, which are the bases of modern and developed societies.
In this context, let me avail myself of the opportunity to draw your attention to the regional problem which has seriously challenged the rule of law, as well as security. Namely. we have witnessed the practice that the convicts with dual citizenship, who are sentenced in one state for the gravest forms of war crimes, get changed sentences / considerably reduced sanctions in another country for the same criminal charges, and get released subsequently.
It is unacceptable that a person who committed mass crimes can avoid justice so easily. The states must invest additional efforts in preventing such practice, so that all who committed criminal offences can be held accountable accordingly.
In regards to the Western Balkans region, it is necessary to establish that no necessary progress has been achieved yet on facing the truth about the past, or a need to restore trust between the states and between various ethnic groups respectively.
In the previous period, some positive processes on this aspect of regional cooperation have been disputed, and even halted. A lack of respect for the judgments passed by the international courts, negative and inflammatory rhetoric, or intensified arming have been most serious factors which have challenged both security and stability.
Having in mind all challenges and internal debates the European Union itself has been faced with, it is necessary to underline the crucial importance of preserving a credible European perspective of the Western Balkans. It is beyond doubt that the European perspective remains the main driver of reforms in the Western Balkans. Therefore, it is of key importance that the accession of all states of this region remains one of the European Union's priorities.
Steps forward which were made, such as the accession of Montenegro to NATO, or signing of the Prespa agreement, have added new energy to the Euro-Atlantic integration in the region. Such momentum needs to be retained in the forthcoming period, too, and that is what we expect from the new European Commission to do.
Bosnia and Herzegovina received the European Commission's opinion, containing a series of reform-focused measures. These measures need to be fulfilled in order to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina is granted a candidate status, and then opens its accession negotiations with the European Union.
The regional cooperation has a huge potential, including development opportunities, and the latest example indicating this is the project of construction of the Sarajevo – Belgrade motorway. This project was initiated through a joint initiative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, and Serbia. Although it was created upon the initiative of these three countries, this project has a huge importance for the entire region, and beyond.
The regional cooperation, founded on the principles of mutual respect, trust, our shared values and intersection of interests, has remained a key framework for advancement of the entire region, and of its people.
I wish a successful chairmanship to Kosovo as the next chairman of SECEEP. I am sorry that their delegation does not participate in this summit.
Thank you."
85320,Address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the SEECP Summit,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85320&langTag=en-US,2019-07-09,"Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear guests and media representatives, I wish you a warm welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is our honour to be the country that chairs the South East European Cooperation Process, because, as we know, this Process was initiated at the Sofia Summit in 1996 with the intention of creating an environment of trust, good neighbourly relations and stability in the region.
Today, we can proudly state that Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the founders of this international regional forum, which in the previous period produced a number of good results and has had positive effects for the entire region.
Let me express my pleasure that Bosnia and Herzegovina has had the opportunity to chair the SEECP for the second time. The first chairmanship was in the period 2003-2004, which I hope had left a number of positive effects, especially in the area of regional cooperation, which is one of the more important principles of the European Union.
By developing regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, we send a clear message that this region, that is, South-East Europe, also called the Western Balkans, can be part of integration processes. Especially those processes that lead Bosnia and Herzegovina towards NATO and the European Union, into which each SEECP member state can be incorporated.
Let us remind ourselves of several SEECP goals, such as:
• development of stability, security and good neighbourly relations
• Intensifying multilateral, economic and trade cooperation in the region, especially cross-border cooperation, improving transport, communication and energy infrastructure, investing and promoting trade
• promoting cooperation in the humanitarian, social and cultural fields
• cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, for the fight against organised crime, illegal drug trafficking, arms and terrorism.
When we look at these goals, then we can conclude that the cooperation of SEECP member countries is very good in these areas.
Certainly there is room for us to work more together in solving many open issues we have, which will further enhance our neighbourly relations. In this regard, I invite you all to make additional efforts together and find ways to resolve these open issues, in the interests of all our citizens. It is necessary to maintain the stability of the region, and through our mutual cooperation and common mechanisms, to maintain and more easily control the illegal migration flows that our countries have encountered. Only together can we more easily and effectively face the challenges ahead of us.
In this way, we will show that the area of South-East Europe certainly belongs to the European Union, and that each of the countries that have not yet got the status of a member of the European Union can certainly pass all the challenges imposed by the membership procedure.
Therefore, we all need to work harder, especially in harmonizing our local legal systems with the European acquis, in order to show that we are ready to accept and apply European standards in all required areas.
I urge all SEECP member states to respect the judgments of the International Tribunal for Genocide, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, and thus pay tribute to all victims of genocide as one of the prerequisites for building lasting reconciliation and trust among the countries of the Western Balkans.
Once again, I wish you a warm welcome and a pleasant stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you for your attention."
85330,Address by the Serb member and BiH Presidency Chairman Milorad Dodik at the plenary session of delegation chiefs of the South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=85330&langTag=en-US,2019-07-09,"It is a great honour to welcome you on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina here on Jahorina at the final Summit of our chairmanship over the South-East European Cooperation Process. I wish to thank you for your participation here today, noting that today's gathering represents yet another confirmation that cooperation in South-East Europe is not only diplomatic, but also very correct and content-full activity.
Dear Sirs, Madams, Presidents and Prime Ministers,
Honourable ministers and ambassadors,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am pleased to welcome you here at the Olympic mountain Jahorina, our famous tourist center. I hope your stay here will remain a very nice memory. This is the final meeting during Bosnia and Herzegovina's chairmanship over the SEECP, and I am pleased to be chairing the meeting today. I am also pleased that you responded to the invitation to participate in today's summit. This is yet another opportunity to exchange views on the most important issues we are facing in the region, and in particular the state of European and Euro-Atlantic integrations.
You will find a draft agenda for our meeting today in front of you. Do you have any complaints or comments? If not, can I state that you have accepted and agreed on the proposed agenda? Therefore, the agenda is adopted.
Dear Mr Tayyip Erdogan, dear Mr Mile Đukanović, dear Mr Stevo Pendarovski, dear Mr Iljire Meta, dear Ms Ana Brnabić, dear Mr Bojko Borisov, dear Mr Nikolae Hurduk, dear Ms Zdravka Bušić, dear Mr Georgios Iliopulos, dear Mr Oleg Culea and dear Ms Zorica Bukinac, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour to welcome you on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina here on Jahorina at the final Summit of our chairmanship over the South-East European Cooperation Process. I wish to thank you for your participation here today, noting that today's gathering represents yet another confirmation that cooperation in South-East Europe is not only diplomatic, but also very correct and content-full activity.
Many will remark today that the state in South-East Europe is not as we would wish, and not the one we have been trying to establish in the last 20 years. Maybe that is the case.
I would generally agree with such an assessment. We founded this process 23 years ago in order to be a forum where we will solve problems or at least create conditions in which these problems can be solved by some other mechanisms. If the Process serves it, use it then, let's do it today and here, to start some things and agree on things. You know, as well as me, that there is talk about the so-called. rationalization of regional initiatives. It of course makes sense. It is clear that circumstances change, but it is not always easy to respond to a call for participation at the appropriate level.
I am not sure that this process should be rationalized or quashed. This is an initiative we consider as an autochthon to the region of South-East Europe. When it is already so, I would use, for the benefit of our countries and the region as a whole, the support provided by the European Union in this process. In addition, the countries of South-East Europe, as we know, are either members of the European Union or aspire towards the membership. That is why the countries which are not members of the Union will contribute to the process of solving the problems that largely relate to the European path within the Process.
I do not want to interfere in anyone's bilateral problems, although I believe that we can talk about everything at the meetings within the Process. However, I think that it is not right that we waste our time today by exchanging pleasantries, and then we part without any results, and that our citizens continue to expect and, of course, suffer the consequences of not being able to agree on some important issues here.
I'll start with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some say that there are problems with effective functioning and that is now manifested by the fact that even after nine months after the election, we have not been able to form all the government institutions. I can tell you that the process of talks and the agreement on forming government has long been considered complete. I believe that we will be able to do it quickly and that we will be able to inform you all about it. In fact, it is only necessary to apply what we have already agreed on within BiH. Therefore, the agreement and compromise which we had reached. When everyone accepts it, and when I say all, I mean inside and outside of this country, the path towards further outputs will be open. What about the so-called foreign affairs problems of Bosnia and Herzegovina? As those foreign policy issues, border issues with Croatia and Serbia are often mentioned. We have a standstill there, and almost nothing is happening. I propose that we make a statement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and the one between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, in which we establish joint commissions that could continue and actualize these issues.
We know that it is very important to resolve the issue of the border and that we must not allow time and waiting for that to happen by itself. We could begin by confirming the agreement from the year of 1999 with Croatia, which is considered as the agreement that settled the problem on an interim basis. I suggest that today we also agree on the formation of joint commissions that will deal with all open issues, such as the issue that arises here in BiH, regarding the issue of the Neum Bay, but also the issue of the assets of companies from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who are prevented from using these by the decisions made by Croatia. That's why we need to work together to jointly work on the issues in question, rather than simply leave it to the media and some other processes. I also suggest that we today agree on the way of resolving the environmental issues between BiH and Croatia. Not only Trgovinska gora, but also Oil Refinery, which Croatia, quite justifiably, is concerned about.
I suggest that we today agree on the establishment of an expert commission between BiH and Serbia, which will solve a bizarre problem of the order in the steps of what comes first; whether the agreement of the borders according to the current cadastral status will first be concluded, and then the border will be corrected where necessary or vice versa. This is a trivial problem and of course no one should be afraid to be deceived, especially no one here in BiH. Furthermore, there is our problem with Kosovo regarding export taxes. We understand that Kosovo wants to resolve the issue of travel with BiH. We expected this issue to be addressed at the regional level, within regional economic areas. But we can talk about it. I see no reason for BiH to accept what Serbia has already accepted in relations with Kosovo. But the abolition of taxes is an international legal obligation accepted by Kosovo within CEFTA. International legal obligations must be implemented while in force. Imagine if we did something like that. And with regard to the request that Bosnia and Herzegovina first recognizes the Republic of Kosovo, and that would be followed by the abolishion of taxes, I think we should not waste words on that. Despite all, we regret that the Prishtina delegation is not here, because of missed opportunities for further cooperation on the regional level. What was the reason for this? They explained that they were not satisfied with the treatment by the host. However, had we not fully complied with the arrangement regarding regional representation which Prishtina had agreed on, and was involved in this process before? We think there was no reason to cancel it. If I am allowed to notice, Prishtina seems to be trying not to leave the center of international attention lately. I do not think this is the way to go, and that they need to let go of such a stance.
In the end, the current migration problem. We do not need explanations here of what the problem is, everyone knows it, but we need to know what options there are for solving this problem. Can we solve it by simply hermetically closing the borders between non-members and members of the European Union, and not vice versa, and not between the non-member states?
If we keep an open flow from one member to another, as well as between two non-members, and at the same time seal off the flow from each non-member to each member, the number of migrants will grow in non-EU countries to the number under which they will explode, and then there would be regional and EU interventions to solve this problem in all countries in the region. That is why I have reservations about projects that the European Border Service assists the Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the idea that the border between BiH and Croatia is hermetically sealed off. At the same time, migrants continue to arrive in BiH by known routes. Also, I am not in favour of the Armed Forces of BiH to be deployed to the border with Montenegro and Serbia, it would not send a good message for the region. I suggest finding a sustainable solution, a solution that will be regional in character and in cooperation with the EU. I suggest that European experts meet as soon as possible with representatives of relevant ministries within this Western Balkans forum in order to discuss the situation and propose a solution.
Certainly, a regional body that will deal with the issue of migration should be created. One thing we surely must do, and we all share the same stance on this, is to prevent the trafficking of these people whose fate is already very hard. What we should certainly have, and we all share common attitudes about it, is to prevent the smuggling of those people whose fate is very difficult.
There, I have given a few ideas and I do not know if I was in focus. Later, I will ask my colleagues from the Presidency to also address you.
I invite you to be open, as I have tried to be.
I invite you to make suggestions and for us to not only discuss these, but also to reach at least some solutions.
Last night we attended a joint dinner and I thank you for contributing to creating a constructive atmosphere for the program today.
Thank you for your attention. We will continue as per agenda.
I would like to give the floor to Mr Komšić, a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who will address you."

Tirana, May 9th, 2019
Esteemed colleagues,
It is my great pleasure to participate for the first time at the Brdo-Brijuni Process leaders' meeting.
I extend my thanks to President Meta, President Grabar – Kitarović, and President Pahor for their invitation.
In particular, let me extend my thanks to President Meta for his warm welcome here in Tirana.
I am very glad that our friends Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of Poland, and Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy are with us today. We appreciate very much indeed their support to the European perspective of the Western Balkans, and to strengthening relations between our region and the European Union.
Since it was established in 2013, the Brdo-Brijuni Process has represented an important platform for enhancement of the regional dialogue and cooperation, as well as for resolving of open issues and promoting the European future of the Western Balkans.
Slovenia and Croatia, as initiators of this process, have demonstrated their firm commitment respectively to the European perspective of our region. Having in mind the European Union's internal debates on the issue of enlargement, it is of particular importance to have advocates of the idea of enlargement amongst the members of the European Union. Therefore, we have to use today's meeting to send together the messages which are important for the European future of our region, thus helping our friends within the European Union who have been advocating for the enlargement.
The situation in our region is much more complex now than it was the case six years ago, when the Brdo-Brijuni Process was launched. Namely, there are more tensions indeed, as well as political instability, and security challenges in the region now. The important changes at the international level have strongly reflected themselves to the relations within our region, too. A lot has changed since 2013. However, some issues have remained the same.
The respective processes of integration into the European Union and NATO still have the key importance in shaping the future of our region. These processes represent the best framework for the implementation of our shared aspirations for the lasting security, stability, and prosperity.
The regional cooperation, based on mutual respect, equality, trust, shared values and cross-section of interests has remained the key to resolving numerous challenges we have been faced with, and for achieving progress in the process of integration into the European Union and NATO.
Although, in the past six years, the countries in our region have not fully achieved the planned progress, the processes of integration into the European Union and NATO have had a significant impact to the development of democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for human rights.
Furthermore, the integration processes have provided a decisive contribution to resolution of the open bilateral issues between the countries in our region.
Accession of Montenegro to NATO Alliance, and signing of the Prespa Agreement between Greece and North Macedonia are particularly important moments for the overall relations in the region. These two milestone events boosted new optimism of all of us in the region.
Such moves forward have indicated that, through the mechanisms of dialogue and cooperation, and with credible European and Euro-Atlantic perspective, our region can indeed resist the negative external influences, as well as resolve successfully the open issues and disputes which were lasting for a number of decades.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made important moves forward in its integration- focused processes. In December last year the ministers of foreign affairs of the NATO Alliance member countries approved that Bosnia and Herzegovina could submit its first Annual National Programme within the NATO MAP Programme. The NATO MAP is a framework for continuation and enhancement of the current cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the NATO Alliance, which would represent a significant contribution not only to peace, security and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the entire Western Balkans region. All states in our region have had very strong cooperation with the NATO Alliance, and most of them were already granted full membership in that organization.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved progress in the process of integration into the European Union. We submitted the replies to the European Commission's Questionnaire, and we have expected the opinion of the European Commission on our application for membership, followed by a decision of the European Council on granting the candidate status to BiH. There are a number of reforms which lie ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the process of its accession to the European Union. We already undertook one such reform, particularly in the period until the year 2015. We are determined to continue to implement all the remaining reforms which are necessary for us to meet the Copenhagen and Madrid criteria alike for accession to the European Union. The reforms are necessary in order to harmonize our system with the values, regulations and standards of the European Union. A positive opinion of the European Commission on Bosnia and Herzegovina's application for membership, and a decision of the European Council on granting Bosnia and Herzegovina a candidate status would provide us with a powerful incentive to speed up the implementation of all the necessary reforms, and to achieve an even greater and faster progress within the accession process.
Being fully aware of the debates conducted within the European Union on the issue of enlargement, I would like to emphasize a crucial importance of the credible European perspective for the Western Balkans. The integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union has an indispensable importance for the overall European security and stability, and it brings about the mutual benefit to both the Western Balkans and the European Union.
The migration crisis has demonstrated interdependence between various regions, and, in particular, the connection between the European Union and the Western Balkans as its immediate neighbourhood. There is a strong consensus within the European Union concerning the protection of the external borders, and the fight against illegal migration. It is important to underline that there can be no successful protection of the external borders or migration control without stability and security in the Western Balkans, and without the latter's credible European perspective.
The European Council will soon adopt the Strategic Agenda of the European Union for the period from 2019 to 2024. An order of priorities which will represent the framework of the European policy in the next five years will be established by this agenda. It is hugely important to provide clear and unequivocal guidelines for a credible perspective of the Western Balkans countries' integration into the European Union in the agenda concerned.
The process of integration into the European Union has been proven as the most efficient mechanism of transforming our states, societies, and economies into modern democratic states, into the societies of European values, and into competitive market economies, achieving lasting stability, security and overall social and economic development. It is for this reason that we need to maintain the current momentum in the process of our region's integration into the European Union.
It is up to us to take responsibility for ourselves and, by means of the concrete reform-focused activities in our countries, as well as through an enhanced regional cooperation and networking, send the best message in favour of the accession to the European Union.
Thank you."
84161,"Address by Šefik Džaferović, BiH Presidency member on the occasion of marking the anniversary of the crime committed in Ahmići",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=84161&langTag=en-US,2019-04-16,"Esteemed families of the shaheeds, dear residents of Ahmići, honorable guests, We gathered here today to mark the 26th anniversary of the horrific crime committed in Ahmići, and to remember, once again, with both dignity and sorrow, the 116 innocent victims killed in a bloody and insane campaign carried out by the perpetrators.
It was on today’s date that members of the Croatian Council of Defense (HVO), led by the sentenced war criminal Dario Kordić, committed the gravest crime against the civilian population during the conflict between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and HVO.
During the massacre in Ahmići, the darkened criminal minds demonstrated the darkest side that human beings can demonstrate, if at all one can call a human being someone who is capable of killing a three-month old baby, a four-year old boy, to burn a mother with her four children, to kill women and elderly people.
We will remember the victims forever indeed as it is our obligation and duty alike to do so. At the same time, we have to take care of the families, the surviving residents of Ahmići. It is our obligation to ensure their peaceful and dignified life, as well as to ensure both truth and justice for them.
Six crime perpetrators were sentenced for the crimes committed in Ahmići. They were sentenced to 95 years in prison in total. That is less than one year of imprisonment per victim!
It is obvious that these crimes were not committed by the six perpetrators only. There will be no justice for the residents of Ahmići until the very final perpetrator is brought to justice. We hereby re-iterate our pledge in Ahmići today that we will not cease from pursuing such outcome.
I have initiated that within the Institute for Research of Crimes against Humanity and International Law, which has been operating for over two decades now, a special center should be established, with the aim to document each individual and mass crime. The task of such center will be to report the crimes to the competent judicial institutions, and to follow up closely what will happen further with each particular case.
Such center will become operational soon, and its task, in addition to what I already stated, will be to oppose, together with all of us, the attempts aimed at equalizing the victim and the aggressor, as well as the attempts of changing the character of the war in BiH. Unfortunately, the latter is exactly what one part of judiciary system in our country has been supporting.
We have witnessed to the judiciary prosecution of honorable defenders of BiH, our generals, due to the crimes committed by individuals. The aim of such prosecution is to create a virtual joint criminal enterprise which would be assigned to the Army of RBiH. For individual, less grave crimes which were committed by the members of the Army of RBiH, the draconian sentences have been passed, and such sentences have been almost the same as those made for the mass crimes committed by the aggressors’ armies.
At the same time, next to no perpetrators have been found responsible before the domestic judiciary system for the planned and organized crimes, mass killings, persecution, destruction of entire residential areas, a four-year brutal siege of Sarajevo, the crimes committed in Prijedor, across the Krajina region, the crimes committed in Goražde, and in other parts of the Podrinje region, as well as for other crimes committed throughout BiH.
They are trying to present that we were all the same.
We were not the same.
The crimes committed by the aggressors were planned and organized, fueled by the political decisions and backed by the whole system.
There were crimes committed by some irresponsible members of the Army of BiH, too, but these were individual cases which we tried to sanction even during the most difficult conditions in the course of the aggression.
Today is the anniversary of the crime committed against the Croat civilians in Trusina, and it is with sadness that we have remembered these victims, too.
Therefore, we are not the same even now as we have no objections that each perpetrator should be brought to justice for his crime. It is only in this way – by truth and justice – that we can work successfully on restoring trust among the peoples in BiH.
Truth and justice are the two words which are very important for successful restoration of trust. Everyone must face it, both our neighbors who committed the aggression and ourselves within Bosnia and Herzegovina. All that is needed by our country and its entire well-intended people is the truth on what was happening here during the aggression. Nothing less, and nothing more than that. All of us know all too well what happened here, and the minimum all of us must gather around is the truth established by the international courts, including the International Court of Justice in the Hague, and the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia in the Hague. These two courts established that there was an aggression made against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that mass crimes and genocide were committed by the aggressor forces in this country. Two joint criminal enterprises were established in the judgements concerned – i.e. one driven from Belgrade, and another one driven from Zagreb.
Unfortunately, on the one hand we are responded by negating of the judgements made by the international courts, by negating the genocide which was established by the court, by glorifying and awarding the perpetrators, by naming student dormitories after the perpetrators who were found guilty by the final and binding court decisions.
On the other hand, we have also seen negating of the Hague sentence on the joint criminal enterprise committed by the leaders of Herzeg-Bosnia, as well as a lecture, organized by the Church and the University of Zagreb, delivered to students by the war criminal found guilty for the massacre in Ahmići. These are horrible messages, which have been sent to the victims’ families, to all of us, and to the entire civilized world.
However, there was an encouraging message from the young people and one part of the public in Croatia, who opposed the glorification of the war criminal concerned. Such attitude raises hope in the possibility that civilized values condemning crime and protecting the victims will prevail. We expect that such an attitude should start being promoted, too, and without hesitation, by the political, religious, and intellectual elites of the Croats, both in BiH and in Croatia.
We do live together, we share the same living space, we are directed towards one another, and that is the only path towards restoring trust and building a shared future in our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is our obligation to future generations.
Thank you."

Baku, 14 March 2019
Excellences,
Ladies and gentlemen!
I extend my congratulations to the International Centre “Nizami Ganjavi” for organizing this forum, which is gathering leaders from the countries around the world to address the issues of global importance. It is my great honour and pleasure to participate in this event and discuss the issues of our shared interest with all of you.
We have lived in the times of great changes. International relations have become more and more complex and unstable, while becoming less and less predictable and while bringing about more insecurity. Global and regional challenges, crisis and conflict have continued to grow more complex and deeper. The phenomena and processes we are witnessing have not been limited to the places of their origin only or to their direct agents. To the contrary, such phenomena and processes have caused the fundamental changes in the architecture of international order.
We have witnessed the deep crises of arms control agreements, the international security used to be based on for decades. We have witnessed the changes of trade agreements, which used to be the framework for international economic cooperation for decades. The huge migration waves, climate changes, terrorist threats, as well as the rise of extremism, international crime and discrimination have remained the burning issues The impact of information technologies and development of artificial intelligence on all spheres of social life, as well as the phenomena such as cyber-crime fall within such challenges for which joint responses are yet to be found.
While the old and the new challenges have multiplied, the international mechanisms and institutions which should address them have been weakened.
No single country can remain focused on its internal issues only, nor can it resolve them in isolation or independently from the processes unfolding in its immediate surroundings, as well as those unfolding globally. Contemporary challenges have surpassed both state borders and individual capacities and capabilities of any country to address them on its own. The processes of rapid globalization and integration have more and more cancelled and made meaningless the traditional firm division between internal and foreign issues, relations, tasks and policies. Security, stability, development and prosperity of each country are more and more dependent on security, development, prosperity of other countries in its immediate surroundings, as well as at the global plan.
This is exactly why we need joint solutions based on shared values and intersection of interest, which can be implemented by joint forces and capacities of all states only.
In this regard, the international cooperation is of essential importance.
Efficient responses to contemporary global challenges demand both shared vision and action, which are based on democratic pluralism, mutual trust, respect for the international law, as well as on a new, more progressive understanding of state sovereignty.
Invitations to joint steps are credible as much as they are honest, and can only succeed if we understand seriously the messages on dangers of alternatives to cooperation. Namely, such alternatives represent a path leading to conflicts.
We should not accept a vision of global reality being a hostile environment lacking regulations and trust. International competition, as a part of the new global constellation, cannot and should not be ignored. A great global match brings about serious challenges and fears. However, it does not necessarily have to mean a confrontation. A faith in cooperation lost in advance means entering a battle for sustainable global peace, security, stability, and prosperity which is lost in advance.
Multilateralism and international order based on the generally accepted rules continue to remain the best platform and the best framework for addressing the global issues. International dialogue, cooperation, respect for the human rights and the generally accepted rules of international law are the key mechanisms for ensuring stability, security, and sustainable development. We must preserve, promote, and keep developing such universal values, principles, rights and regulations.
I represent a country which knows all too well what failure means of such international mechanisms and institutions whose obligation and task is to protect and ensure the respect for such universal international values, rules and rights, but which also knows what it means when such mechanisms and institutions start to implement their obligations and tasks, which are the reasons of their existence.
The countries which share similar experience with that of Bosnia and Herzegovina are firmly committed to respect, protect and promote the international law and global order, based on the universal values and generally accepted regulations of the international law. Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to multilateralism and dedicated to act in accordance with the obligations driven from the international conventions and membership in the international institutions alike.
I firmly believe that the commitment to multilateralism, the respect for the international law, and the adherence to the shared values and global order based on the accepted regulations are the best way of addressing the complex challenges we have been faced with. This is indeed the right path to a safer world.
Thank you."

This was a democratic decision by which, centuries after the foreign-run governance operated within various state communities, Bosnia and Herzegovina proudly renewed its full independence and sovereignty.
Esteemed excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, dear guests!
There are many important dates in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, one of these dates – the 1st of March - holds a special place in our hearts.
It was 27 years ago that almost two thirds of the citizens of all ethnic affiliations in this country voted in both decisive and dignified way in the referendum FOR a sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was the vote FOR a state of equal citizens and peoples, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, as well as members of all other peoples living in it. At the same time, this was the vote AGAINST the greater states' policies clearly aimed at dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such policies were already active at the time.
It is particularly important that the referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was conducted in accordance with all domestic and international legal norms, i.e. in a legal, transparent and peaceful way, and under a comprehensive international monitoring. This was a democratic decision by which, centuries after the foreign-run governance operated within various state communities, Bosnia and Herzegovina proudly renewed its full independence and sovereignty.
It is by voting in favour of independence that the people of this country defined fatefully both the path of our homeland and its future.
There have been many difficult situations and challenges along the path towards an independent, sovereign, modern European state of equal people. We overcome successfully the gravest of all such challenges – the aggression launched against our country after the declaration of independence. We bore numerous victims in order to preserve an integral and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These victims have made heavier the burden of responsibility which we have carried over before the next generations. The victims we bore in the name of our homeland, the victims who paid for our current freedom very expensively, have obligated us to persevere in both preserving and building Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Furthermore, this is our responsibility to the most honourable, most courageous and best Bosnian sons who succeeded in defending this country, while not hesitating to contribute their lives into its foundations. We must never forget these people.
In the meantime, after the aggression against it ended, Bosnia and Herzegovina has faced both graver and lesser challenges. All such challenges have been overcome successfully.
There are new challenges ahead of us. Destructive political forces, including those who have tried to achieve unattained war objectives by other means, have been louder and louder.
I will not focus on such destructive forces too much today, but will only send a message to them that their efforts have been in vain, and that they will never succeed in carrying out their intentions.
Unfortunately, the permanent crises resulting in a lack of desirable economic growth has been caused by such destructive policies because it is political instability indeed which has frightened the investors off. In addition to this, some, often utterly irrational, political disputes have contributed to an increased volume of departures of the young people from this country towards the countries which have operated ordered and stable systems.
Such behaviour of the destructive political forces has not brought about anything good to anyone in this country, and particularly not to those on whose behalf they have been allegedly carried out. If we want to achieve progress for all, it is high time to root out discrimination and inequality from the BiH society in the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and ensure that each person feels at home at each square inch of this country. This is the only way in which each individual in BiH will be guaranteed a better and safer life. Furthermore, we are obliged to ensure a discrimination-free context for the future generations.
Therefore, it is necessary for all political actors to stop with negative rhetoric and destructive activities, and that all of us turn together to a constructive dialogue based on truth and justice, mutual respect, respect for the rule of law, the European standards, and the cooperation aimed at wellbeing of all our people.
There are many examples throughout history, as well as nowadays, which have indicated that we can do much for our country in a way which benefits all when we work together and in unity. I believe that there will be even more of such examples in the time ahead of us.
Our goal is clear: Bosnia and Herzegovina as member of both the European Union and NATO Alliance. Despite the obstacles and destructive policies imposed, we have progressed towards that goal. It is true that our progress has been slow and full of obstacles, but we will indeed – let me assure you – achieve our goal.
This beautiful country is abundant with everything, which is sufficient for all its citizens to have decent lives in dignity, earn for living in a fair way, and raise their children in peace. They do deserve such life indeed.
Finally, I extend my heartfelt congratulations on the Independence Day to all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
May long live our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
83565,Address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić at the reception marking Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=83565&langTag=en-US,2019-02-28,"On 1st March 1992, we did not divide ourselves between those on the left and those on the right, between liberal and conservative, between urban and rural, but we, together with the will of most of the citizens, opted for an independent and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina, for a civil Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear Excellences,
Eminencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Allow me firstly to greet the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all the Bosnians and Herzegovinians in the Diaspora, and congratulate them on the occasion of marking a significant day for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Happy 1st March - Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Throughout the centuries, our country has always been recognizable by its historical struggle for the preservation of independence, sovereignty and integrity, and for the good people who lived and live here today. The dates of 29th February and 1st March will remain written in our history forever, because on those days most of the citizens of our country clearly gave their vote for independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The question put to them then is well known, and it read: ""Are for you sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state of equal citizens, the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Muslims, Serbs, Croats and members of other peoples who live in it? ""
It does not hurt to constantly repeat this question, because it is a reminder of what kind of a state its citizens wanted, and I believe they want the same today.
Although we paid a high price for the affirmative answer to this question, and, unfortunately, suffered huge losses, together we managed to defend ourselves from those who tried to violate the independence, integrity and sovereignty of our country. Unfortunately, this battle for the country by the measure of the referendum lasts to this day, and as it seems even with a higher intensity than ever.
On 1st March 1992, we did not divide ourselves between those on the left and those on the right, between liberal and conservative, between urban and rural, but we, together with the will of most of the citizens, opted for an independent and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina, for a civil Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We should not be divided into ideological camps today either, with regards to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All of us must work together to strengthen Bosnia and Herzegovina as a civil state, a state of equal individuals and equal collectivities. Bosnia and Herzegovina is composed of different identities, but above all, Bosnia and Herzegovina is an identity. The identity of the century-old tolerance and the joint life of all its inhabitants. That's the way it used to be, that is the way today, and that is the way it will, despite everything, remain.
Today, 27 years later, when there are intents and attempts of individuals to again violate this independence, we must actively work and fight against their controversial ideas of division on any basis. This homeland is ours, we do not have other, and therefore we have a duty to work for its benefit, to work for the benefit of its citizens, to ensure dignified life and equal rights to all. We need this because of our youth, and because of the future generations who will be born and who will live in this country. We should use the potential we have and together create a different country - a country for all of us.
I am aware, as I believe most of you are, that we cannot solve all the problems overnight. We need, and we are all obliged, to take the opportunity to finally bring Bosnia and Herzegovina into NATO and the European Union. This is a path that allows a civil state, a safe state in which all human beings are guaranteed basic human rights. Bosnia and Herzegovina is undoubtedly a part of the European space and it deserves to be part of a large European family. It is European due to geography, but it must become so in practical terms too, respecting all Eurpean standards and democratic values. I am convinced that we have enough energy and potential to achieve this, together.
Dear friends, I thank you for being with us tonight. Once again, I congratulate Independence Day to all, with a wish for this holiday to soon be marked in the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you for your attention."

Eminencies and Excellencies, representatives of the international community,
Dear friends,
Ladies and gentlemen!
We have gathered here today to mark a significant historical date and pay tribute to the victims of the Holocaust, the largest and most brutal atrocity of the past century remembered by the human civilization. The date January 27th is marked throughout Europe, and today, seventy-four years later, it reminds us of the day in 1945 when the Red Army freed seven and a half thousand prisoners left by the Nazis in the concentration camp Auschwitz.
Allow me to greet and show deep respect for the Holocaust survivors who are here with us today. To those who were witnesses to the dark side of history that has left them with deep wounds, and all of us with an obligation to confront all forms of evil and violence. The obligation not to let something like this happen ever again.
Unfortunately, what happened during the Nazi regime in the Second World War was not a lesson for some. We have witnessed that in recent history, genocides and grave atrocities were committed. They are still happening today; the genocide was committed here in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, the disastrous fact is that seventy-four years after the Holocaust, there are still certain political forces in our country that do not give up the Nazi heritage. Thus, due to such political forces, the streets in Mostar are named after those who took part in committing the Holocaust.
Therefore, out of respect for the victims, I wish to believe that the memory of the sufferings of the Auschwitz victims, and all other victims of monstrous minds, will be a reminder to the new generations to reject the ideologies that are based on segregation, intolerance, disrespect and lack of care for those who may be different.
As part of the modern civilization, we must not forget what happened, on the contrary, we have an even greater obligation to work on improving mutual relations and building a future in which the rule of law, moral values, the freedom of each individual and empathy will be the imperative. The future which will not allow for war, extremism, inter-conflicts and where every person will have a chance to lead a dignified life.
Thank you."
82921,BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić held the lecture on the topic “Future of Bosnia and Herzegovina: How to step up integration process to EU and NATO”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=82921&langTag=en-US,2019-01-24,"It is my both pleasure and honour to be here today. Thank you for the opportunity to say something about two topics that may seem like a classic foreign policy question for one country, in this case for Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, many things that are not only political are permeated in these two topics; it is not just an administrative or media issue, but it is about certain deep, social and sociological processes that are taking place in BiH. This is not the place, nor do we have much time to reflect on all the developments in the region that are related to what is happening in our country, and even to touch on the role of the great powers and multilateral processes that are also taking place in the European Union, and which subsequently reflect on the whole region, and with that on Bosnia and Herzegovina too.
Allow me to greet all those present and thank you for inviting me to speak at this eminent conference organised by the International Institute for Middle East and Balkan Studies (IFIMES).
The presentation on the European and NATO perspectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina should begin with a brief reminder of what the European Union is and how it originated. So, please, let us briefly return to the time after the end of the Second World War, when the idea of a united Europe was born. The idea originated from Winston Churchill, who dreamed of the United States of Europe, which, prior to the creation of the European Union, were articulated in a series of steps towards the European Union of today by the historical political authorities such as Adenauer, Bech, Beyen, Da Gasperi, Hallastein, Mansholt, Monnet, Spaak, Spinelli and Schuman.
The first form of association can be seen in 1952 in the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which later assumed a new form in the organisation of the European Atomic Energy Community in 1958, as well as the creation of the European Economic Community, also in 1958.
All these were steps towards the formation of the present European Union, which was founded by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty which came into force on November 1, 1993, which created today's Union as an inclusive community with its criteria for accession. The original European Union was formed by six countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Later this number grew to ten, twelve, fifteen, to today's twenty-eight countries.
EUROPEAN ACCESSION CRITERIA
Accession to the European Union was defined back in 1993, within the Copenhagen criteria, consisting of three elements: political, economic and administrative-institutional. Every state aspiring to become the member of the European Union must also fulfil the fourth, administrative criterion, which requires adjustment to a whole series of its own regulations in order to become a successful candidate.
The political criterion represents several further elements, such as the stability of institutions that must be able to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, the protection of fundamental human rights and the protection of minority rights.
The economic criterion concerns the functional market economy in the country in the sense that it is sufficiently capable to cope with the competitive challenges of a major marketplace such as the European Union.
The administrative-institutional criterion states that there must be such an ability of the EU candidate country to fully accept the European acquis communautaire.
These criteria are strengthened by the Madrid Criteria, which clearly state that the country must have a reformed administration and the judiciary in a way that it is able to immediately accept the entire European acquis.
For the countries of the Western Balkans, these criteria are somewhat modified, in the way that the first step is to enter the Stabilisation and Association Process, and then the following criteria are applied:
• political criterion - which has remained unchanged
• economic criterion - which has been changed in the need to strengthen regional cooperation in the Western Balkans and
• administrative-institutional - which has remained the same and relates to the ability of each country to fully accept the complete European acquis communautaire.
In order for the European Commission to see all of these elements, the EU Questionnaire is applied, in which each country that aims to get a candidate status offers a cross-section of the situation in the country through different chapters. There are now 35 of these chapters. We are at this stage - we provide answers to the Questionnaire sent to us from Brussels. We completed some of the answers and sent them to Brussels, and then they returned them with additional questions and our institutions are dealing with these additional issues. We have a kind of promise from the competent institutions in BiH that this will be completed as soon as possible, so that we can complete answers to these additional questions.
Answers to the Questionnaire, which often include additional questions, such as in our case, serve the European Commission to draw up an Opinion, which it delivers to the Council of the European Union, followed by a decision reached by consensus which determines whether a country can be awarded a candidate status. This candidate status may have three variations: direct candidate status, conditional candidate status and conditional candidate status with the deadline for the fulfilment of conditions, in order to formalise the candidate status.
Once the country obtains candidate status, screening of all chapters is done, when together with the candidate country, the compatibility of domestic legislation with the European regulations is observed. In case of a discrepancy, negotiations are opened for each chapter separately.
Prior to the start of the negotiations, a negotiating position of the candidate country is determined, and then the negotiations begin. Chapters 23 (judiciary and human rights) are very often those that are opened first, which is for us, now I speak on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of crucial importance, and 24 (justice, freedom and security), which ranks as high as Chapter 23 in terms of importance. The issues in these chapters are not solved by negotiations but rather with an ACTION PLAN, that is, the candidate country receives very concrete tasks which must be fulfilled in these chapters within a given time frame.
Upon completion of the verification of all negotiation chapters, it is proposed that the candidate country be admitted to membership in the European Union. This is approximately a phase in which we are now, that is, we aim to complete that phase.
WHERE IS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN THAT?
We can present our short overview in the following few sentences, because the situation is very simple, and the European Commission in its report on BiH for 2018 pointed out that the current situation is still not sufficiently good.
If we start from the political criteria, it is clear that BiH has no institutions that can guarantee democracy, the rule of law, the protection of fundamental human rights and the protection of minority rights. Through this theatrical play regarding the changes in the Election Law of BiH, which we witnessed in the period immediately prior to the elections in BiH, we could see the unpreparedness of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the fundamental democratic principles, because the discussion about this boiled down to the construct ""legitimate political representation of the peoples"" which is not the part of the European acquis, nor is it part of the European principles and standards, and in fact represents a clear indication that democracy in BiH wants to be sacrificed by certain political parties in order for them to have a better position in forming of the government (the fear of anyone being outvoted in the European institutions simply does not stick). Something like that is not a democracy founded in the European Union, thus it is quite clear why Mr Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations, said that Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Dayton political model cannot become a candidate for the European Union, because that model differs from the European acquis. This is, in fact, an essential question because the Dayton political model has been abused by loose interpretations that ethnic political elites should be granted rights greater than individual rights of citizens. In order to strengthen such argumentation, comparisons with Belgium, the Netherlands and similar countries (and some even make comparisons with Switzerland which does not intend to become part of the European Union) are used, which is completely wrong since the historical context how these countries originated compared to Bosnia and Herzegovina is starkly different. However, these countries have certainly aligned their socio-political system with the European acquis, whereby there exists protection of fundamental human rights at an individual level, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, unfortunately, it is not the case.
Frightening the people of our country that the civic concept means a unitarian state, which then in turn means the principle of one man - one vote, which results in somebody being outvoted by someone else - these are stories for young children because the European Union is based on the protection of civil rights at the individual level, and that is what we need to do in BiH, to strengthen this principle, not to protect the collective rights as it wants to be presented. The European Union is based on this, and it has confirmed it already two times in the conclusion of the Council of the European Union. Bearing in mind where I am at this moment, the function I perform, and the fact that I am currently staying in a friendly country, I do not wish to mention even certain interventions by the neighbouring states of Bosnia and Herzegovina whose representatives went so far as to attempt to establish a new principle for EU candidate member states, so they called BiH a sui generis case in the whole story. There are no sui generis cases regarding the accession to the European Union. There is no sui generis case with regards to Belgium, where the principle of respect of basic human rights is the founding principle of the organisation of the state. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be a sui generis case with regards to the basic principles upon which the European Union functions.
The situation regarding the rule of law, which in its essence means the existence of a legal state that must guarantee all rights, freedoms and equality to its citizens on an individual level, is completely the same- which immediately differs from the policy of a significant part of the political scene in BiH whose remaining in power is made easy by the Dayton model, even though it is not within the framework of the European democratic principles. Likewise, the rule of law means that there must be a system that will effectively fight against corruption and organised crime, which, again, is not the case in BiH.
An example of this is the recent lack of political support for changes to the Criminal Law of BiH, where political parties are trying to make amendments which will result in protecting certain actors of criminal activities coming from their ranks. Therefore, there are many political structures in BiH wishing to actually move BiH further away from the key principle of the functioning of the EU, such as the rule of law, for one simple reason-to maintain its political position, influence and power and ultimately, I have to say, suspiciously acquired material assets.
Who is the promoter of EU values in BiH, who wants what? Who really wants the European Union? What are the motives behind politicians in BiH who opt for the EU? -that is a special issue. There are those who really and frankly want to join the EU, and I think that there are those who want the EU, naively thinking the European Union will agree to gamble with the principles upon which it functions.
The economic system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a deviation of the free market, where there are different oligopolies, which negotiate and agree on the market behaviour (for example, petroleum products distributors). Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign country does not fulfil the initial condition, and it particularly does not fulfil the requisite of having the necessary competitive ability in challenges offered by the large market place of the European Union.
There is no need to speak of an administrative-institutional criterion, as there are no political statements by various political actors or political parties that would undoubtedly say that they will do everything possible for Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt a complete European acquis.
How will they accept such a degree of change in socio-political reality that would surely diminish their political power, currently given to them by constructs of the type of ""constituent peoples"" or ""legitimate political representatives of the peoples"" that completely neglect democracy, to such an extent that they offer systematic discrimination which, as a consequence, gives greater political power to those same opponents of European values.
WHAT IS, THEN, THE WAY OUT OF THIS SITUATION?
The first element would be the search for those political structures, parties, concepts and personnel that can convince us in their public appearances that they know the procedures for accession to the European Union for start, and the second part, and that they are really doing it. Unfortunately, there are many public declarations claiming the commitment to the EU, as well as NATO, but essentially, this is the case of mere demagoguery. “We will strive to join the EU” is one of the most common sentences you can hear in public speeches of politicians or political elites. This gets forgotten very soon and we return to the functioning so typical for our region, that some call the Balkans, some call it the Western Balkans, while others refer to it as Southeast Europe.
What is to be done? We need help, sincere help from the European institutions. We need clear and precise positions, we know the standards, if we wish to know them. But we need, not just the message from all European officials, diplomats, but we need to see the messages in action in BiH. There should be no double standards, especially those applied by EU officials. I have been in this business for too long, and I have, unfortunately, had such experience with some EU officials, from the European Commission as well as the diplomatic corps. On the one hand, there is the general story and message and, on the other, it is the case of a classic Balkan political game. I have too often been in such situations to see it; we have often been witnesses to double standards coming from EU officials. With such a policy, the EU will not get a reliable partner in BiH, nor will BiH make any progress. I expect the EU institutions and member states to be able to recognize those forces in BiH, because it is really not difficult, that are really devoted to the European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to refrain from repeating to us constantly ""well, you know, it is your reality"". We need to adapt, but with such political action, with such philosophy, we will not get far. We had the opportunity to see this stance in the negotiations regarding the changing of the Election Law. Fortunately, such stance failed to win. We also had such an example when adopting the Excise Law in BiH. I have to say that I was shocked by what some EU officials are doing on behalf of the European Commission. You will not believe what happened. I cannot comprehend politically nor legally - that we have adopted two laws whose very important Articles clash with each other. And this has happened under the patronage of the European Union officials. In the aftermath, those officials come and state that BiH has suffered a decline. Therefore, if we are going to talk frankly, it is necessary to find BiH forces which sincerely wish, not only to formally fulfil criteria and requirements set out by the EU, but which see in those criteria the opportunity for a recovery of a whole society. Not only administration, political life and public discourse, but the recovery of the society in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We need standard criteria of the EU because of us, because they change us as people in BiH and create conditions to move away from the mud in which we live and create something out of this country which will resemble an orderly country, a democratic country in which people will be able to see their future and prosperity.
LET US SAY SOMETHING ABOUT NATO
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the North Atlantic Treaty, better known as NATO, is an international organization of military and political nature, founded in 1949 by signing the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Agreement) between the twelve states of the then Western bloc. The basis of the North Atlantic Alliance is the Agreement between Member States, which in its nature is an international treaty. The Agreement recognises and supports the states' individual rights as well as their international obligations under the United Nations Charter. It obliges each Member State to take part in the risks and responsibilities, establish a joint defence system and requires each not to accept any international obligations that might be in contravention of the Agreement.
The idea of NATO formation, besides its security nature, was the creation of a military bloc to counter the spread of ideological communism to the Western world, as a response to the historical circumstances of the time after the end of World War II. As an opposition to this military alliance, the Warsaw Pact was formed at the time, creating the then bipolar world order, and the Cold War began, which lasted until December 1989 when the US President George Bush and the then USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev announced at a conference in Malta that the Cold War was over. Regarding the Cold War, it is important to say two more things. First, it was a conflict based on ideological differences, led by all the means other than military. Second, it had its own reference terms, such as détente or peaceful coexistence between 1968 and 1975, which worked through mechanisms of the specially formed CSCE organization, at a conference in Helsinki in 1973, which served as a channel or space for communication between the West and the East. After the ending of the Cold War, this organisation was transformed into OSCE at the Summit in Budapest in 1994. This organisation represents the largest international organisation which promotes security and cooperation, ensures assistance with initiating political negotiations and decision making, and acts as support in recognising early warnings, conflict prevention, crises management and rehabilitation after conflicts. It has its six permanent missions (one is in Bosnia and Herzegovina), and several observation missions.
NATO ENLARGEMENTS
During its existence, NATO had seven enlargements, that is, acceptances of new states to its membership. Here it would be good to say one thing in terms of the enlargement, and it refers to the idea initiated by Zbigniew Brzezinski, as the then member of John F. Kennedy's Electoral Staff at the beginning of the 1960s, when he proposed, as a solution to the Cold War, that NATO expands as eastwards as possible, primarily thinking of his native Poland. Nearly 40 years later, or more precisely in 1999, NATO began enlargements to Eastern European countries, within its fourth enlargement (Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary), followed by the fifth and the largest enlargement in 2004 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia), then the sixth expansion in 2009 (Croatia and Albania) and last, hopefully not final enlargement in 2017 (Montenegro). By observing the geopolitical idea of Zbigniew Brzezinski from the early 1960s, it is obvious that NATO expanded to the east of Europe, towards Russia, as close as it was possible. This provokes Russia's opposing reaction, because any new NATO enlargement to countries in the Eastern and South-Eastern parts of Europe causes a security imbalance. It uses all means at its disposal, apart from the military for now, to fiercely oppose this. This is also the reason why Serbia is positioning itself in such a way, because of its political connection with Russia, and BiH entity, Republika Srpska, is following suite by declaring its military neutrality despite this act being completely unconstitutional. Why unconstitutional? Because Article III of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly states that entities do not have jurisdiction over membership in international organisations, if this is not approved by the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, entities cannot prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina as an internationally recognised state and subject to international law, to enter into international agreements and international organisations.
Article III / 5 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly important, as it deals with the competencies to be taken over by the state authorities for the protection of sovereignty, territorial integrity and international legality of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This Article III / 5 of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the legal basis for the adoption of the Law on Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which in its Article 84 prescribes an obligation on all state bodies to work on the future membership of BiH in the NATO Alliance.
WHAT IS MAP?
During its existence, NATO attempted to articulate its expansion through Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which set the criteria for admitting new states to NATO membership. Since the description was too ambiguous, leading to various initiatives and groups such as: Višegrad Group, the Vilnius Group, and the Adriatic Charter, NATO has designed and launched the MAP (Membership Action Plan) program, which has its own five criteria:
• Willingness to resolve international, ethnic or foreign territorial disputes peacefully, through commitment to the rule of law, human rights and democratic control of the armed forces;
• Ability to contribute to defence and missions of the organisation;
• Ensuring adequate financial resources for the armed forces in order to fulfil the membership obligations;
• Security of sensitive information and protective measures that will be provided in this regard;
• Compatibility of domestic legislation with NATO.
This is a brief overview of the significance of NATO's MAP program, with one note that this organisation sets specific criteria separately for each NATO candidate country, hence the separate criteria for Bosnia and Herzegovina, known as the Tallinn criteria.
WHERE IS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN ALL THAT?
Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed its will and aspirations to join the NATO alliance in the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2005, when a decision was made to join the Membership Action Plan. Thereafter Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the 2006 Partnership for Peace program and signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of security in 2007. This led to NATO launching an Individual Partnership Program with BiH in 2008, which led to the launch of the ""Intensive Dialogue Program"" agreed at the 2008 Budapest Summit. After that, Bosnia and Herzegovina applied for the MAP in 2009, which NATO approved in 2010. The criteria added at the NATO Summit in Tallinn in 2011 included registration and entry of prospective military assets.
This is when the problems started because NATO has set individual conditions for BiH, which refer to the entry of 63 military locations as state property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those who may have dealt with this, who are lawyers, know that this is a more administrative-technical issue, where property is checked that has been transferred to the BiH Ministry of Defence through a decision of a relevant authority, which is, a rather technical process where no negotiation or political will is required. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a problem in our country which led to the Constitutional Court of BiH having had to make a decision which ultimately resolves this type of dispute and creates the necessary legal and formal conditions for the property to be registered.
In the meantime, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska entity adopts the so-called Resolution on the Protection of the Constitutional Order and the Proclamation of Military Neutrality of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian entity. Although the Resolution is a non-binding document, and it does not have the force of law, it creates political problems in the further NATO path of BiH. This resolution is used today to challenge the Tallinn Condition; it is used to draft an annual action plan that is technical rather than a political issue; which, ultimately, can be done by the executive authority such as a minister of defence alone. No new political decision by the Presidency of BiH is necessary, or by the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH; it is not even necessary for the Council of Ministers to react, i.e., let me be more specific, the body which is equivalent to a government of a state. It is possible to do this through a decision, that is, an action by the minister of defence of BiH who will shape all we talked about technically in a document and submit to NATO. Unfortunately, we have stopped here now. The will does not exist in one part of the political institutions, political forces in BiH to realise this; one part of those who were believed to be committed to NATO path of BiH is starting to calculate politically and move away from the whole technical part of the process, so that Bosnia and Herzegovina in this moment stands on one technical question, while all necessary decisions which included everyone, that is, all segments, all political institutions at the state level have been made.
WHAT IS THE EXIT STRATEGY?
The exit strategy is precisely in looking at the annual action plan as a technical issue, rather than a political one, and to submit the plan of action at the technical level to the structures to overview, approve and state whether it is good enough for this year.
Unfortunately, we have made a big political problem out of that. We have come to the stage where, because of the announced anti-constitutional and illegal activity in the area of NATO integration, I, as a member of the Presidency, cannot give mandate to the new Chairman of the BiH Council of ministers. His name is not controversial, his political background is not controversial; the fact is that he comes from a party that is one of the winners in past elections, but because of statements from his political party that he will not enforce decisions and laws on defence, we cannot assign him a mandate.
Unfortunately, any question, whether technical such as the annual action plan within the national NATO membership plan, can grow into a top political problem here. I think that there is a way out of this situation: the current minister of defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina submits the already prepared annual national MAP plan to NATO, they review and approve it, possibly add to it, and we continue our path towards integrations.
I have talked a while longer, but it is worth recalling some technical historical facts, put Bosnia and Herzegovina in certain contexts, and try to provide some answers to get us out of the current situation. I would like to thank the organisers once again for the invitation, and I would like to thank you for your attention. I stand at your disposal for all your questions or clarifications. Thank you."

Mr Dan Preda is one such person. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank him for everything he has done so far in order to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes a member of the European Union as soon as possible.
Šefik Džaferović, BiH Presidency member
Dear ladies and gentlemen journalists, let me extend a warm welcome to you. I am grateful to you for responding to our call to be notified on what we discussed today at the meeting, which we find important, held at the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Christian Dan Preda and Mr Wigemark concerning the European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the persons who have strongly supported BiH are paying a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina today. Mr Dan Preda is one such person. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank him for everything he has done so far in order to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes a member of the European Union as soon as possible. At the moment, it is up to us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to resolve the issue of answers to the additional questions most urgently. I expect that process to be completed in the following days. There are certain problems concerning education in Chapter 26, having in mind different competencies of the state, entity, and canton levels. I expect that the Council of Ministers will complete these answers in the following days, and submit them to the European Commission. This is the issue which is most urgent concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina and its European path.
The second issue we tackled today is the specific one concerning the functioning of the Parliamentary Committee on Stabilization and Accession. You are aware that this is an old issue, that the European Parliament's Parliamentary Committee on Stabilization and Accession is composed of and led by a group of the European Parliament members, and a specific group of members of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. our Joint Commission for European Integration. You are aware that, for a relatively long period, there has been a discussion within that body on its rules of procedure, i.e. on its decision making procedures.
Namely, we have had a problem concerning the decision making procedures due to the position taken by the members of the state Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. by those who come from the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Entity of Republika Srpska. The European Parliament has its own rules, and, in my opinion, Bosnia and Herzegovina should follow the rules and decision making procedures in the Committee in accordance with the recommendations of the European Commission. We also said that, after the state Parliament committees established, we from the Presidency would try to hold a meeting with the members of that specific Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, of course, with the members of the European Parliament's Committee in order to find a solution to the problem concerned. It is our goal that Bosnia and Herzegovina gets granted a candidate status as soon as possible in the course of the current year, and that it should be done before the elections for the European Parliament would be held. As we already discussed it together previously, and as we specifically emphasized at today's meeting, the period after the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and before the elections for the European Parliament, should be used in a way ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina should not be idle or at loss concerning its progress along the European path. That was, in briefest terms, a summary of what we discussed at today's meeting. Mr Dan Preda will hold meetings with other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let me, once again, avail myself of the opportunity to extend my thanks to him.
Christian Dan Preda, Standing Rapporteur for BiH in the European Parliament
I would like to thank the media representatives for attending this event. First of all, I wish a happy New Year to you, with all of my best wishes to you and to the citizens of this country. I am here today in the capacity of the rapporteur on Bosnia and Herzegovina on behalf of the European Parliament. We adopted the report on BiH within our Foreign Affairs Committee. This is a report which was adopted in that form at the plenary session. However, as it was said already, no joint parliamentary committee has been established yet between the Parliament of the European Union and BiH. The committee would be composed of 50% members from BiH and 50% members from the Parliament of the European Union, and it should ensure a consolidated joint work on the European path of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, in the previous three years, we have not succeeded in persuading our friends from the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH to come to Brussels and Strasbourg in order to enable our joint work on these issues. Actually, what was attempted was to apply the rules used in accordance with the rules of procedure in BiH to the joint body of the two parliaments. In such way, actually, they tried to transform the European Union into a big BiH. The challenge is to do exactly the opposite, i.e. that BiH becomes a member of the European Union, and not that the European Union gets transformed into some big BiH. This would be my message. Namely, I am calling upon you as the media representatives to send an invitation, a letter to your Parliament members, and ask the citizens to do the same – ask the representatives in the Parliamentary Assembly to work together and cooperate with the colleagues in the European Parliament.
Please note that this mechanism of joint parliamentary committees is something that was already established by other countries in the Western Balkan. Further, it was mentioned that we waited for the replies to the additional questions of the European Commission. The candidate status of Bosnia and Herzegovina is something that depends on provision of replies to the additional questions because such replies will enable the Commission to prepare its opinion in a written form. So, in order to prepare such an opinion, it is necessary to have the replies submitted first. Let me just remind you that the Commission sent its additional questions in June 2018. We are now in January 2019. Therefore, I would say that it has taken a bit too long indeed. I hope that this issue will be resolved prior to any other issue.
Further, let me note that we discussed with two of the three BiH Presidency members the issue of importance of composing the authorities at all levels. After the elections anywhere in the world it is normal to compose both legislative and executive authorities accordingly. I hereby re-iterate that we are now in January 2019, so, could you please do this as well? Finally, I will add that we tackled the Dragičević case in the course of the discussion. No single political party has succeeded in mobilizing so many citizens around such issue as sensitive as this one. Therefore, I believe that the politicians should be most careful indeed. Something is going on, I would say, at the level of the society, people, i.e. the citizens are seeking justice and looking for solutions. This is not a problem of one individual, nor is it a problem of the prosecutors from Republika Srpska only. The citizens have insisted that justice should be done. I hereby invite the host authorities to solve this case as soon as possible.
Thank you very much."

Until the end of his life, Lord Ashdown was a great fighter for the values of the free world.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bosnia and Herzegovina lost its great friend. His homeland the United Kingdom lost its great politician and diplomat, and the world lost a wise and a good man.
We have gathered today to pay respects to him. He deserved it by his deeds.
He was born in 1941, in the midst of the World War II, when the international order was fiercely disturbed by the aggression, and when the whole nations were under threat of extinction. Until the end of his life, Lord Ashdown was a great fighter for the values of the free world.
When the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina started in 1992, he was at the zenith of his career as president of one of the leading parties in the British Parliament.
He recognized straight away the importance of resistance against the forces of tyranny, which conducted the aggression against our country and threatened our people with extinction.
He arrived to the besieged Sarajevo as early as in August 1992, met with the late President Alija Izetbegović, and offered his support to a struggle fought by a free and independent country, which symbolized defending the values of the free world.
Until the end of the war he was one of the most ardent advocates of the international community's intervention aimed at stopping the aggression and genocide.
It was by this undertaking during the 1990's that he won the right to repeat, years later, the truth that the genocide in BiH could have been stopped with more willingness and decisiveness of the international community. “We could have prevented this horror. We chose not to do so,“ he was saying and reminding the world.
Weighted down by quilt, such awareness became the foundation of a more decisive engagement of the international community in our country, particularly after the Dayton peace agreement was concluded.
Lord Ashdown was indeed a personification of such decisiveness.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina we will remember him as High Representative, who made the unfair Dayton peace a bit fairer through its correct interpretation and application alike, thus making Bosnia and Herzegovina more functional in the interest of all its citizens.
During his mandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 20002 and 2006 some significant reform-driven progress was made. Namely, the integration path of Bosnia and Herzegovina was laid out to its membership in the European Union and NATO Alliance.
Forming of many state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important heritage of OHR during the Ashdown's mandate.
During his mandate many democratic institutions of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina were either formed or strengthened, as the basis for sustainable peace and security, economic progress and the respect for human rights of all citizens and peoples in BiH.
A single Armed Forces, a single tax system, the state security agencies such as the Intelligence and Security Agency (OSA) and the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA), as well as the state judicial institutions are just a part of the heritage for which the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have good memories of a joint work of OHR, the Council of Ministers, and the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH from that period.
A decisive initiative of Lord Ashdown on the cooperation with the Hague Tribunal and on the persecution of war criminals and their collaborators was particularly important.
The truth is that for all his decisions he had a full political support of the overall international community through the Peace Implementation Council. However, Lord Ashdown provided a crucial contribution to the reforms by his energetic approach. These reforms enabled us to have a much stronger state.
Lord Ashdown was a man of action; a diplomat who gave priority to specific actions over being concerned and restrained.
He knew that the political forces which threatened the democratic values should be responded to decisively and prevented from their destructive intentions.
On the occasion of commemorating the 20th anniversary of the genocide, Lord Ashdown said that the western world had to remember Srebrenica not only as a witness to such horror, but also in order to understand what would happen when it turned its back.
This key lesson has resonated by the power of its essential meaning: the international community should not turn its back on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lord Ashdown did not turn his back. He fulfilled his political mission, and, above all, his mission as a human being.
He remained faithful and selflessly committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to the end. “I really love the Bosnian people,“ he said in one of his last interviews.
Let us keep our memories of him by fighting for Bosnia and Herzegovina, for freedom, truth and justice.
May our friend Paddy rest in peace."
82390,Address by BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić on the occasion of the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=82390&langTag=en-US,2018-11-30,"Dear soldiers, NCOs, officers, generals, Esteemed officials and guests! Bosnia and Herzegovina is one proud country, which has, through its thousands of years long tradition, also cherished the necessary aspect of defence of its territorial integrity to show and prove the existence of its sovereignty. The Armed Forces of BiH are yet another way of showing the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the statehood anniversary of which we have marked recently.
Protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity is the task of all states, and each country organises their own system of defence in which the fundamental role is played by the armed forces. That certainly is not an aggressive role, but the role which by its definition is defensive and serves its fundamental task – defend in every moment territorial integrity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In that regard, all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina rightfully count on the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were formed with a task that is not at all simple, but with a very clear and decisive intention.
Besides this task, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina showed readiness to participate in activities during natural disasters in our country, where you had, almost every year, an opportunity to, through your engagement, save lives of our citizens as well as their property.
I wish to pay respect to members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina for successful participation in international missions and exercises, especially for the participation in exercises in cooperation with the NATO forces, as well as congratulate the acceptance into the BiH Armed Forces six hundred new young soldiers. I hope we will create better conditions for their work in the next period.
One of the more important aspects of the BiH Armed Forces is also the part regarding NATO membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereby we need to fulfil five conditions from the MAP program. We, as the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are very close to the activation of MAP. Although we have done a lot of work on the fulfilment of conditions from MAP, we are still lacking the fulfilment of the final fifth condition or an added condition which regards the land registration of perspective military properties to the state institutions. That certainly does not depend on you, but on the current politics, but I firmly believe that we are bringing this difficult task to the end despite political obstructions directed towards weakening of the Armed Forces and the defence sector of BiH in general.
Therefore, it is necessary to, first and foremost, work strongly on modernization of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a special focus on mobility and ability to fulfil basic tasks, but also in aid to the population in emergencies. Continuation of registering of military property and fulfilment of MAP conditions, as I have already said, must be our top priority. Furthermore, in the period ahead, it is necessary to strongly commit to increasing a degree of interoperability with the NATO Alliance member state armies, as well as the increase in the budget of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and further staff training within their structures. The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only the support to peace and stability of our state, but they are also the support to peace in the world, proven by our participation in peacekeeping missions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue giving support to our allies in the NATO peacekeeping missions and show that will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder, alongside those with whom we wish to share our future.
Once again, to all members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, wishing you all the best for this day and anniversary!
Thank you!"

It all starts with a word. Heavy words, insults and untruths which are told, require an answer. Then that answer is followed by another. All this creates a spiral which produces bad atmosphere in which it is very difficult to work. That is how artificial crises arise. Investors start avoiding us. We lose time irrevocably, instead of solving real problems.
Excellences,
Eminencies,
Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen,
Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
I greet you with the feeling of great honour that I stand in this place today as a member of the Presidency – but more so with the feeling of greater responsibility towards the obligations that stand before us in leading our state in the next four-year mandate.
First of all, I wish to thank the citizens of our homeland for showing the democratic capacity in the recent General election.
It is down to us to establish the parliamentary majority speedily and efficiently, at all levels of government. In my opinion, these have to be program majorities comprised of, primarily, the winning political parties which have the capacity to rule at all levels.
We need a wide and stable parliamentary majority which would – bearing in mind the jagged responsibilities of different levels of government – cover the whole state. The election results show that such majority is possible to build. Everything else is a question of responsibility of political actors towards the assumed obligations. The government needs to be established as soon as possible, caring about the whole state, and without any conditions.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Allow me to thank the members of the Presidency from the 2014-2018 mandate, who, despite numerous challenges, did a lot in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens. Their contribution is particularly visible in the unblocking of the Euro-Atlantic path of our state.
The new Presidency members have the opportunity to enable the country to, based on the work done so far, move the country forward in the society of modern and prosperous European states from which the people would not be leaving, but would want to stay and build their and their children’s future here.
In order for that to happen, it is necessary to lead a few processes in parallel, and the key ones are reintegration of the country and its integration to the European Union and NATO. This to be followed by speedier implementation of economic and societal reforms.
People in this country are tired of useless and unnecessary quarrels. They wish to live in peace, to raise and educate their children, have security, social justice, hope and perspective. It is our duty and obligation to offer them that.
For start, it is necessary for all to think about the words they articulate in public space. It all starts with a word. Heavy words, insults and untruths which are told, require an answer. Then that answer is followed by another. All this creates a spiral which produces bad atmosphere in which it is very difficult to work. That is how artificial crises arise. Investors start avoiding us. We lose time irrevocably, instead of solving real problems.
If we approach each other with respect, even when we have different views, if we lead a civilized dialogue, if we aim to reach an agreement on key questions, and if we are committed to truth and justice, then we will be able to truly work on reintegration of the country.
That reintegration assumes the same rights for every citizen in every part of the state, regardless their ethnic and religious belonging, as well as a joint action in accomplishing the interests of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am convinced that a huge majority of people wishes to live in such a state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I will advocate such Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Young people are leaving to organised and modern European countries, members of the European Union. That process can be halted only if we make Bosnia and Herzegovina the same as those countries.
Significant steps have already been made. Bosnia and Herzegovina is about to gain the candidate status for membership in the European Union.
It is necessary for all of us to further speed up the European path of our state. Fulfilment of conditions for membership in the European Union must be a top priority. Most of the program of the new governing coalition needs to include the European Commission recommendations which we are obliged to adopt in the accession process. I believe that there is a general consensus about this in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
If we do all this, then we can expect Brussels to offer us further impetus by responding fast with approving our candidate status.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In all these processes the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina plays a special role and responsibility.
I expect this Presidency to lead responsible politics which reflect in creation and preservation of political stability.
I believe that with such a stance, the Presidency will send a clear signal to all institutions at all levels of government that they also take a serious and responsible approach in executing of their obligations.
For it to be so – and for the Presidency to establish itself in the full capacity as chief of state – we have to consistently abide by the Constitution, law and democratic principles.
We must – without any doubt – respect and implement the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its 11 annexes. We have just committed to that by giving a solemn oath. That includes the respect and implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and all decisions by the international and national courts, as well as all earlier laws and decisions,
All of that which is colloquially called “Dayton” in our public space. All of that is one whole and one package. There cannot be a partial approach. Everything must be respected and implemented equally and with the same intensity.
All of us –without holding back - must be committed to the rule of law and respect continuity of the previous decisions. That is the founding principle of a legal state. The adopted decisions by the institutions must be respected until new ones are brought, and they should not be contested or brought into question. The functioning of our system is not the thing of constant and repeated agreements, but of Constitution, law and adopted decisions. If we have adopted a law once, then that law must be implemented. Only questions which are not covered, or those that need changing can be a subject of an agreement. Until then, the current system must function and no one can condition or contend it as that would be an obstruction leading to anarchy.
Change of a political stance on some question is legitimate, but the adopted decisions and laws must be respected and they can be changed only in the same place as they were adopted in the first place.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Regarding the defence, we must commit to further reform of the defence system in accordance with the NATO standards and Defence Review which was adopted by the Presidency in the previous mandate. Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina must have the capacity to execute its tasks and missions from the Law on Defence, in every moment.
Our Armed forces largely apply the NATO standards already. They participate in international security and peacekeeping missions under the auspices of this organisation, as well as the Organisation of the United Nations. We expect that the Action Plan for the membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in NATO will soon be activated, so that we could continue with the reforms of our defence system.
Beside the Euro-Atlantic path, as our key foreign policy goal, regional cooperation and relations with our neighbours are important to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We need a dialogue in the region. There are numerous open questions with our neighbours. They can only be solved by dialogue. The Presidency needs to insist on building cooperation with neighbours on the principles of full mutual respect and reciprocity as well as the respect of international law. It also must care for the interests and rights of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the rights of our legal entities and individuals. We ask of our neighbours only that which belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will never give up on that.
Alongside the cooperation in the region, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to continue to build good relations with all our partners and friends in the world, and with all those who respect our country and are well-intentioned towards it.
There is a lot of work ahead of us, and many challenges. Let’s make this mandate be remembered as a mandate of cooperation, agreement, progress and prosperity of our state. I am convinced that we have enough maturity and wisdom to, with God’s help, make a step forward in that direction – to make sure that every person in this country feels comfortable, to live better, and to be proud of his or her homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you!"
82202,"The address by the newly appointed member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina representing the Croat people, Željko Komšić at the constitutive session of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovi",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=82202&langTag=en-US,2018-11-20,"Ladies and gentlemen, our state is founded on the principles of anti-fascism. The time that lies ahead challenges us to show Europe and the world once again that we belong in the line of states which at their core cherish civilizational, European values, and anti-fascism is one of the greatest civilizational and European values. The idea of anti-fascism, in its essence, is interwoven with a vision and necessity for equality and unity. I deeply believe that only together we can take our country into a happier and better time and a better environment.
Respected gentlemen, members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed officials, your excellences – members of the diplomatic corps, dear citizens and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, dear guests and friends, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been given a great honour and a large obligation once again to represent the interests of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the people I come from. I have just sworn not to betray the trust I have been given, and I will put all my knowledge and effort in it. I will be the president of all citizens, affirm all values of a democratic society and civilizational heritage.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank our predecessors Mr Dragan Čović, Mr Mladen Ivanić and Mr Bakir Izetbegović for their work, in, what is now already a previous convocation of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The insistence and work on the rule of law, that is, affirmation of constitutionality, legality and justice as a general category, affirmation of democratic and civilizational heritage will be at the top of my priorities list.
Without the fight against every type of discrimination there is no freedom, and there cannot be freedom if there is if only one citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina who has had his or her basic human and democratic right denied.
The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina need to know that, as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I will be an advocate to every kind of equality, national, religious, gender, social… simply, every equality.
Ladies and gentlemen, our state is founded on the principles of anti-fascism. The time that lies ahead challenges us to show Europe and the world once again that we belong in the line of states which at their core cherish civilizational, European values, and anti-fascism is one of the greatest civilizational and European values.
The idea of anti-fascism, in its essence, is interwoven with a vision and necessity for equality and unity. I deeply believe that only together we can take our country into a happier and better time and a better environment.
In order to succeed, we first must be responsible, accountable towards the state as a union and towards the people who live in it.
There is no responsibility towards the state if we tolerate crime, corruption, injustice, segregation and general insecurity of citizens, because we all know that these produce poverty, unemployment, discontent and at the end of the day despair of all kinds which drive our people from the homeland.
In its recent past, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina has overpowered all the negative circumstances due to the strength of its citizens. Conscious of our historical responsibility, we today have to look into the future because, we cannot change the past, but the future should not be uncertain!
I am firm in my conviction that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in the membership in NATO Alliance and membership in the European Union. Those are also the guarantors of security and prosperity of our state and its citizens.
The NATO path of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the same place it was when I was in the building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the same position as today, just four years ago.
The time has come to change that, and I will not miss an opportunity to change this through activation of MAP for the membership in NATO Alliance. Nor will I miss the opportunity to actively promote those policies and processes which pull or push, whichever way we wish to look at it, Bosnia and Herzegovina only and exclusively forward. I will do this led by democratic and civilizational values and in cooperation with institutions of the European Union, United Nations and the states friends of our country.
In the next four years, Bosnia and Herzegovina should stop being an object but become a subject of international and regional relations. With that regard, I am ready to make an additional effort in accomplishing greater cooperation with the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Serbia, with Montenegro, and, of course, with the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Slovenia.
Before me is also work on fulfilment of the planned activities and initiatives I presented in the “Presidential vision of progress”. This is the plan which has concrete ideas and goals. The priority is strengthening of our economic position, new approach to diplomacy and foreign policy of BiH, fight against foreign influences on the election process and prevention of the growth of violent groups in the country. I will actively promote the change of the coordination mechanism, and will also strongly advocate the implementation of the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, and equal value of the voice of every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has not been the case to date.
Ladies and gentlemen, lastly, a little reminder.
Today is the Universal Children’s Day.
On 20 November 1989 at the General Assembly of the United Nations the Convention of the rights of children was adopted. The Convention contains the universal standards the signatory states must guarantee to each child. Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the countries that accepted this Convention.
Let the leading thought for us be about the kind of the country we are leaving to them, our children, our future.
Let’s make sure they are growing up in safe surroundings without violence, war, scarcity and illness. That is primarily what we owe to them, the children. But, we owe that to ourselves too.
Thank you."
82314,"Address by Milorad Dodik, the newly elected Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the constitutive session of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 20 November 2018",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=82314&langTag=en-US,2018-11-20,"Esteemed members of the Presidency, Esteemed members of the Presidency to date, Representatives of state institutions of government at the BiH level, Representatives of entities’ government President of the National Assembly, President of Republika Srpska, Members of the government, Your excellencies Your eminences It is a special honour for me to be here today to, together with my colleagues, take over the duty of a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After the General election in which I received more than 370000 votes as a confirmation of my election, speaks about the way I will act, my basis, that is the home basis is Republika Srpska. I come to the Presidency as the representative of Republika Srpska and the Serb people, and I will fight to, together with other members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in accordance with the Constitution, return the position and dimension they have according to the Constitution. It is not my intention to do any harm to anyone or to do anything to prevent any Croat, Bosniak or any organizational unit, canton, municipality on the territory of Federation, or the Federation itself, in any development project.
I would like to make such cooperation which can prove to be effective. We have long moved from the causes of the war. This is a serious opportunity to take a step forward today and try to create a society which can exist led by democratically elected peoples’ representatives in democratic elections that repeat a few times in Bosnia and Herzegovina. My politics will be based exclusively on respecting the Constitution, that which is written in the Dayton Peace Accords, that which I accepted here to swear to, the Constitution and the Dayton General Framework for Peace Agreement. Naturally, many here know that I have many objections on the works of High Representative and the way the Constitution and the political system in BiH has been derogated. I think we will have to have discussions again about many questions and in that way show our ability to make new compromises.
The solutions reached 15 – 20 years ago may have suited that time, but the solutions which we have to adapt today must suit this time. I will advocate for the abolishment of the role of High Representative in BiH as soon as possible. I think the continuing role of High Representative has not been in the interest of the long term stability and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many decisions which were brought, and these count to over 540, contained imposed laws, to which High Representative did not have the right to do, as well as the intervention in the Constitution of the entity which High Representative did not have right to do. The role of High Representative was introducted in BiH with Annex 10 of the Dayton Agreement, signed by Republika Srpska, FBiH, Serbia and Croatia. According to that annex, he can only implement civil parts of the Agreement, and we have seen that in the past, it was more than that.
I think we will have enough wish and will to make the best, and I know I will. I have said already that I do not wish to make any bad moves towards the Bosniaks or Federation or Croats and their cantons, but likewise, I ask for an adequate treatment of Republika Srpska which I represent here and the Serb people, wherever they may be.
Our politics, the politics of Republika Srpska, which is general knowledge, will be my politics. I am here as the representative of Republika Srpska and the Serb people, to implement policies in relation to military neutrality, and to reject any processes which lead towards directing Bosnia and Herzegovina towards something that is not in the interest of Republika Srpska and its people.
I think it will be necessary to work on that together, to have more understanding and mutual respect.
In any case, regarding the military neutrality, elements for it are part of the political consensus of all, the government and opposition in Republika Srpska, and I will very proudly implement politics which have a successful, comprehensive consensus with regards to this question. Naturally, I do not exclude a possibility and I have the need to say that the European Union needs to be the goal of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, together with my colleagues, I will ask at the next session that the EU and its structures, regardless that this may appear naïve, grants the candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina at soonest, so that we could create new dynamics.
And this will not be only to our detriment. We will express our commitment with statements, but we also want to see the commitment of Europe.
Europe, which has significantly modeled the political system here, the successes and failures of BiH, will now be in a position, this is not a condition, I know perfectly well that I can not make conditions, but in any case, I think it would be reasonable to get the candidate status as soon as possible and to develop our potential within this framework, and to get a new dynamic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We will cooperate with all important factors. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a member of multilateral and other organisations will continue to act in accordance with its own interests.
I will do my best for our relations with the European Union be good, and for our relations with the USA be good also. We support the politics of the American president who does not want to interfere into the affairs of other countries. I would like to see that in practice and I will advocate this since that is what I had heard.
Likewise, I do not need nor do I want to hide the fact that my cooperation with the Russian Federation has been very successful to date, and I will naturally not give up on this cooperation.
I consider it very important also that we have comprehensive cooperation with China, which will encourage investments and our development.
I wish to discuss and to be present, together with my colleagues, as the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in other places, at bilateral and multilateral meetings and places where these questions are discussed.
I am not ready to leave the capacity gained at elections, that is 372000 votes, to anyone else and thus will not allow for anyone to impose decisions created in my cabinet. I will be very satisfied if we complete the mandate with the fact that we can say that we have done something good for all citizens and peoples in BiH, and that we did that with our own forces. As I have been doing to date, I will continue to actively and visibly advocate for foreign judges to leave the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must return the judiciary to the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as has been prescribed by the Constitution. We must conclude that the judiciary reform implemented earlier by the OHR was completely unsuccessful, that is has produced a significant degree of corruption an that it has produced one lack of functioning and alienated centre of power in BiH beyond the will of the people who voted for political representatives, considering or putting us in a position to respect the independence of judiciary, which has been dependent on international institutions.
All this will naturally be difficult to achieve. I do not have an illusion about it now. Unlike my function to date, where I was the President of Republika Srpska, now I will have to and I will with my colleagues, jointly consider and reach certain decisions, and I believe we will be able to do that. I would not have accepted this duty if I did not believe that.
If Bosnia and Herzegovina does not start showing a new dimension and a new impetus, I do not see my place here. I have not come to take photos, receive salary, nor have I come here to travel the world; I have tried and seen all that. I want us to make an agreement here with full respect of, before all, two entities, three peoples, state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you."

I am sincerely honoured by the Global Islamic Finance Awards awarded in the categories of leadership and Islamic finance. Dr Azmi, let me avail myself of this opportunity to thank You and the Edbriz Corporation Board for the award, as well as for your decision to select Sarajevo as a host of this year’s ceremony.
This year’s GIFA is organized within the Sarajevo Halal Fair. I am glad that participants and exhibitors from 43 countries have come to Sarajevo, and that Sarajevo is hosting so many foreign guests.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved a significant economic growth during the last four years. The Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina succeeded in stabilizing public finance and extrabudgetary funds, a strong GDP growth has been marked, the number of new jobs in manufacturing industry has increased significantly, a particular growth of the metal processing industry was achieved, as well as of tourism, textile and wood industry. The rise of exports last year was highest in the region, exceeding 17 percent. These facts and clearly positive economic trends in Bosnia and Herzegovina should lead to an increased share of the Islamic banking capital in the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Islamic finance may play a significant role in the building of our infrastructure, firstly through the application of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), which achieved excellent results in some countries like Malaysia, Turkey, Jordan, Djibouti. We are about to embark on a mass construction of roads, by which we will connect all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further, we will start building energy infrastructure, airports, roads, water supply systems, schools, hospitals. Given that such projects demand relatively large investments, there is an opportunity to mobilize more than one financial institution in order to ensure joint funding. I see an opportunity for funding through the Islamic finance there – in projects which would be built based on the Public Private-Partnership principle.
The potential and capability of Islamic banking in PPP have been recognized by the World Bank, too. Namely, in its analysis on fulfilment of the UN Global Agenda on sustainable development 2030, the World Bank has recommended Islamic banking as one of the most appropriate means of funding of the global sustainable development, including the infrastructure projects in particular.
Islamic finance is based on the philosophy of shared risk. In that context, infrastructure PPP projects are naturally conductive of Islamic finance. Funding of such projects requires a certain level of risk sharing with other project parties, whereas their purpose is both social and economic development.
A successful example of such business operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its region is the BBI bank, whose partnership-based projects have supported economy and industry. Very positive effects have been achieved indeed for the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina through encouraging investment and presenting projects at the two flagship business events implemented by the BBI, i.e. the Sarajevo Business Forum, and the Sarajevo Halal Fair.
As far as I am concerned, I will continue to provide support to Islamic banking, which is a synonym for both ethical and humane banking, in which attitude towards man is equally important as earning profits. Led by such values, we have successfully implemented the Turkish credit line, through which the returnees were enabled to start their own businesses. It was by this credit line that over 7,000 jobs were created. This is a significant part of the economic growth of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the segment which is very important to us, although it is sensitive and risky – supporting the poor people who start their own credit-supported business for the first time. This is a profile of people which the bankers have avoided.
In today’s word, which has comprehensively exhausted the resources selfishly and irresponsibly, the Islamic banking and halal production in general have offered hope and healthy alternatives because they have respected the God’s creations – nature, animals, and man.
Thank you!"

It is my pleasure to greet you at the start of the 9th congress of the Global Alliance of Diaspora and wish you a successful and fruitful work.
In particular, I hereby greet the leadership of the Global Alliance of Diaspora and all of you who came to your country from various parts of the world to pursue together with us solutions to the problems the diaspora has been facing, as well as the problems of our country. I hereby congratulate you for being persistent in holding the congress sessions, as well as for the serious topics you select and delegate.
Among you there is group of those who deserve to be noted in particular, i.e. those who have invested their money earned abroad in our homeland, thus enhancing the development and strengthening stability of our country. They have deserved a special gratitude.
Minister Borovac and Minister Osmanović ara also with us today. I congratulate them for their persistence in solving the issues their ministries have been facing, and particularly in view of progress achieved in cooperation with the diaspora and enhancement of its status.
This congress is an opportunity for me to present to you some processes which took part in our homeland recently. The previous several years will be remembered as the time in which a tough political struggle has been fought between those who strive to build peace, BiH, and a joint future in it, to start its progress along the EU and NATO path, and those who have strived to stop and dismantle the country, and achieve the war objectives by political means. I do refer here to the anti-constitutional referendums, verbal provocations and strikes against the territorial integrity, security and judicial systems, glorification and awarding of the war criminals and the war para-state projects. All this has taken place in our homeland. It was success to keep stability, make positive shifts forward in such circumstances and prevent blockades and deadlocks.
Under such unfavourable circumstances, we adopted the strategic documents which enabled BiH’s progress and a departure from the many years of deadlock on its EU and NATO integration path. After a 15-year delay, the Foreign Policy Strategy of BiH was adopted, too. After many years of trying to do so, we finally managed to adopt the Policies on cooperation with expatriates. By appeals submitted to the Constitutional Court we saved the citizenships of hundreds of thousands of Bosnians and Herzegovinians living abroad, their property was saved in the RS, the discriminating 9 January as the “RS Day” was disputed, and so on.
We completed and submitted the EC Questionnaire. These days we received the additional questions which would be completed shortly. We hope that by the end of the year we will be granted a membership status in the EU. The Survey of Defence, which is a precondition for our progress towards the NATO membership, was adopted, too.
Given the circumstances, the results achieved by the governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of stabilization of economic situation in our country have been solid. In this sense, we need to underline:
- A 3.0% GDP growth reaching a record 30.156 billion Bosnian Convertible Marks in 2017;
- Industry production average growth in 2016 and 2017 respectively was higher than 4.5%;
- continually increased Bosnian and Herzegovinian foreign trade, with an increased volume of trading, exports of goods, decrease of foreign trade deficit in goods and a better coverage of imports by exports. The exports have grown for almost17% in the previous year, and for the first time the coverage of exports by imports exceeded 66%.
- Concerning the public debt, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a moderately indebted country. Compared to other countries in the region, BiH is, in both absolute and relative sense, the least indebted country. The debt amounts to 6 billion Euro, which is less than 40% of GDP, whereas, for example, the public debt of Serbia exceeds 25 billion Euros (73% of GDP), and the debt of Croatia is higher than 40 billion Euros (over 85& of GDP),
- Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the list of the twenty countries in the world with highest number of tourist visits in the last three years. More than 2.6 million of overnight stays were recorded in 2017;
- My promise made in 2014 on 100,000 newly employed in the sector of production in the period of ten years will be fulfilled with a minimum 60% of that number achieved after four years already, which exceeds the plan.
Your activities, which we appreciate and for which we are grateful, have contributed to such results. The remittances which mainly represent financial assistance to families, and which exceeded three billion Bosnian Convertible Marks or 18% of GDP have helped the economic stability of our country significantly.
The state must do more for the diaspora. There are some who make obstacles to such processes as those who do not love BiH do not love its diaspora either. The resistance is strong.
The authorities of BiH, i.e. the responsible part of those authorities, have indicated a clear BiH’s commitment to be at its diaspora’s disposal, while providing a necessary support to ensure access to the diaspora’s rights in the homeland. First of all, we are dedicated to establishing and continually building a normative framework and institutional mechanisms for cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and its diaspora at all administrative levels, particularly at the local one. It is our objective that the cooperation with the diaspora becomes a part of the legal order of BiH.
It is our intention to enhance cooperation in ensuring that you have access to your rights in the countries in which you live now through bilateral cooperation with such countries, as well as through establishment and strengthening of your representative bodies. We need to pay a particular attention to supporting the preservation of the mother tongue, culture and identity of the peoples and minorities of BiH.
At the same time, we expect a proactive approach from you, as well as initiatives and suggestions in the form of specific projects and programmes. As you become increasingly important actors in the political economic, educational, sports, cultural life of the countries in which you live now, we expect from you to engage yourselves that in a similar way in the processes in your homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina,
You have possessed love for your homeland, but also the knowledge, skills, valuable information, financial and social capital, you have the experience gathered in the developed countries. We therefore invite you to build Bosnia and Herzegovina together with us and enhance it to the point when it will meet the standards of the countries you come from.
Let us be partners in building of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a modern, European state in which, at its every square foot, each citizen, regardless of a religious or national affiliation, will be equal and satisfied.
These are the processes which will last for years, and even for decades. These processes will demand patience and persistence.
There are also processes which last for one day only, i.e. sudden shifts which may compensate for the lost years. On the seventh of October this year the diaspora can show its strength and change the political balances in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in RS, in which Bosniaks and Croats are still the third-class citizens.
The patriotic political forces in the country have become an important factor without which there are no calculations in BiH or in the Balkans. However, such political factor, in most cases, is capable of stopping the negative tendencies and attempts only.
We do not have enough strength for starting the country in the right direction. The instances of resistance to such endeavour are too strong. Additional strength can be given to us only by you, the diaspora. A mass registration and voting in the elections, voting for the patriotic, peace-making political forces may change the situation in the country which you love in one day only.
Do organize yourselves and make such effort!
Do make the 7th of October a day which all of us will remember.
Thank you, I wish you all best!"

Turkey has supported us in the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), in our aspirations concerning the European Union, our membership in the European Union and NATO, as well as in the economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina has supported Turkey in regards to the stability of that part of the region. We extend our congratulations to you for your strength demonstrated there in order to stabilize the situation not only in Turkey but for the entire Europe by doing that job. You have succeeded in taking care in a very humane way of three million refugees, in mitigating that pressure advanced towards Europe. You have been fighting with the terrorists from DAESH, FETO, PKK, your military actions conducted at the borders of Turkey did not result in large numbers of victims. Moreover, such actions were very successful in a military sense. Address delivered by Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of BiH Presidency:
Esteemed President Erdoǧan, let me, once again, welcome you to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is our second meeting this year as we met already in Ankara. You are here with us today. In the meantime, Prime Minister Yildirim visited Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have maintained a good dynamics of mutual visits.
Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina have excellent relations. Turkey has supported us in the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), in our aspirations concerning the European Union, our membership in the European Union and NATO, as well as in the economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina has supported Turkey in regards to the stability of that part of the region. We extend our congratulations to you for your strength demonstrated there in order to stabilize the situation not only in Turkey but for the entire Europe by doing that job. You have succeeded in taking care in a very humane way of three million refugees, in mitigating that pressure advanced towards Europe. You have been fighting with the terrorists from DAESH, FETO, and PKK. Your military actions conducted at the borders of Turkey did not result in large numbers of victims. Moreover, such actions were very successful in a military sense.
Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina have the highest number of signed agreements. Therefore, the economic cooperation has grown significantly and its current trend is to grow further. In the previous year the trading between our two countries rose to almost 800,000,000 American Dollars, which was doubled compared to the situation four years ago. I hope that many free trade agreements which we should sign shortly will additionally strengthen this cooperation, so that we will exceed the trading worth 1 billion Euros shortly. In particular, those parts of the agreement are important which refer to the meat quotas, which will be defined and fixed at eight thousand tons a year of exports to Turkey by preferential prices, which are somewhat higher than the current market prices, and we will be safe for five years in this way. So far this was done each year anew to ensure that sufficient time and incentives for the people to develop that business. Concerning the wheat flour, sugar and oil quotas, which will be exported from Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are talking about tens of thousands of tons in the forthcoming period. The most important project we discussed today with the Turkish side was, of course, the construction of the motorway ring leading to Belgrade via Tuzla and Bijeljina, and returning through Požega and Višegrad to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The feasibility study, completed by the Turkish side, is not too optimistic regarding the south branch of this road, i.e. there is no sufficient frequency over Goražde, so that, probably, we will have to decide to go for a slightly cheaper version of a fast road. After the meeting between the delegations, we continued the meeting with the prime ministers and ministers of traffic of both countries only, and it was agreed that in the summer we would launch a public call, a procurement notice which will define potential investors and builders of this road. A letter of intentions was signed today in this sense – the two ministers signed the letter of intentions containing the main elements. We support continuation of the bilateral cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey and Serbia, and we hope that during the summer we will have a meeting in this sense. Further, the present meeting, which was supposed to be an official one, was turned into a working one. We were supposed to hold one in late June. There is still time enough to organize an official visit, too in the course of July or August, particularly if by we get to have new elements concerning the construction of the motorway.
The Turkish credit line has had excellent effects. It employed thousands of returnees to RS, and some in the FBiH as well, and ensured a normal living standard to dozens of thousands of families. I believe that we will soon have a response from the Turkish side, i.e. that the credit line concerned will be extended, and that it will be available for ten more years again, while we still have four years remaining to implement the current one. This cooperation should be mutual, so that today we noted with care the remark made by the Turkish side which re-iterated a lack of raw material for the two large Turkish investments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e. for the Sisecam in Lukavac, and for the Natron Hayat. Bosnia and Herzegovina promised to provide a stable supply with the raw materials, and it does not meet that condition. Thus, we will have to invest an additional effort in order to keep these investors in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in order to get, eventually, new hundreds of jobs which they are offering if we succeed in guaranteeing the raw materials.
I informed Mr Recep Tayyip Erdoǧan about the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I think that the image projected by the media is somewhat worse than the actual situation. Namely, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a very active attitude of the Council of Ministers, the present ministers and the Council of Ministers’ Chairman, has actually arrived to the front door of the European Union, and the front door of the NATO Alliance membership. We have followed the region on economic issues, so that we are not lagging behind at all. In increased exports, which reached almost 17% last year, we are the leader in the region. We are the leader in the region in terms of reduction of the number of unemployed persons. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the least indebted country in Europe. Thank you.
Address by Recep Tayyip Erdoǧan, President of the Republic of Turkey:
Esteemed Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed ministers, and esteemed media representatives!
I hereby extend my most cordial and respectful greetings to all of you. It is my great pleasure and honour, after three years, to be in Bosnia and Herzegovina again.
Let me, once again, extend my thanks to Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for his hospitality to me and my delegation.
We held very constructive bilateral and inter-delegation discussions. We discussed in detail a number of issues focused on politics, culture, tourism, transport and agriculture, i.e. on what we could do and on which steps we would make.
We discussed the bilateral relations and many issues, including economics, trade, infrastructure, transport, energy and tourism. Moreover, we discussed specific applied industry sectors. We would like to advance our cooperation in all these areas in the forthcoming period, too.
Turkey will continue to provide all kinds of assistance for preservation of stability, peace and prosperity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let me, once again, confirm hereafter the importance we attach to the preservation of territorial integrity of the united and sovereign state which consists of the two entities and one district. I wish that the forthcoming elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina contribute to enhancement of peace, stability and prosperity.
We will hold our elections on the 24th of June. There will be the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in October. I hope that these elections will be opportunities for enhancement of our relations. I hope that the elections will be held in accordance with the democratic rules, in peace, and in a transparent and fair way. We believe that the issue of changes of the Election Law, which is an important issue on the agenda in this election period, is an internal issue of this country, and we believe that the parties will resolve this issue in accordance with the reason, dialogue and mutual understanding.
Esteemed media representatives, we have advanced our trading, and, in a short period, we would like to increase its worth to one billion dollars. We already have sufficient willingness and readiness to achieve this. Therefore, it is of huge importance to sign a new Free trade agreement promptly in order to continue to work on the basis of it. Likewise, it is our shared wish to ensure that all agreements needed for continuation of the negotiations enter into force as soon as possible. An intense cooperation between our officials will be continued in the areas of transport, logistics, energy, tourism, agriculture and livestock sectors. We have encouraged the Turkish companies to implement large investments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the whole of Balkans alike.
Our country has provided a strong support to infrastructure and transportation projects in this region. The Turkish companies are always ready to participate in these projects. I believe that the Turkish companies will work more on the infrastructural projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I believe that the project on Belgrade-Sarajevo motorway will be the best example of such infrastructure building projects.
Likewise, we attach a huge importance to establishment of regional relations, which will be based on trust. These relations will be led by the relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia and Serbia.
We will continue to implement the triple mechanisms with significant contributions provided by all sides, between Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.
Dear friends, we will continue to work actively in order to activate the NATO Membership Action Plan as soon as possible, and we will never leave Bosnia alone on this path. It is our great pleasure that Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfilled its obligation within the European integration process. It is very important that Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its replies to the European Union questionnaire on 28 February. We hope that such acceleration achieved within the European integration process will be continued without delays.
Following the attempt of a military coup on 15 July, let me, on my own and on behalf of my people, re-iterate my gratitude to Bosnia and Herzegovina for its solidarity demonstrated in relation to Turkey. As also underlined by Mr Izetbegović, FETO has continued to exist as an octopus grabbing all levels of the society. Therefore, we have to conduct a huge fight against this issue. We also expect that the efforts and measures against all structures of the terrorist FETO organization in Bosnia and Herzegovina will get completed as soon as possible. We are ready for all kinds of cooperation on this issue, and we will continue to cooperate with the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to implement the specific steps. Turkey will continue to provide support to Bosnia and Herzegovina in all areas. Our country has not had and will not have any hidden intention or agenda other than establishing prosperity, unity and economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in the area of economic development and the issue of sending 8,000 tons of meat. I believe that this is insufficient. As we said today, we can increase this figure to 15,000 tons, and this will contribute significantly to new employments in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I used to work a bit in this sector in the past, and I am very well familiar with it. I know what livestock means, and I know what sliced meat means, too. Therefore, we can contribute, through our joint work, to Bosnia’s huge progress on this issue.
Finally, let me reiterate my thanks for your hospitality and close friendship, and extend my most sincere selams and greetings to all of you."
76837,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member at the opening of the Muslim",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=76837&langTag=en-US,2017-08-07,"Salam, Shalom, and good afternoon.
I am deeply honoured to speak at the opening of the eighth Muslim-Jewish conference, which is held in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina this year, in a city in which Muslims and Jews alike have lived in unity for almost half a millennium, and in which the monotheistic houses of prayer have literally leant on one another.
Universal values are made of several milestones of human activities accumulated slowly in many layers over time, which, then, through culture and tradition, imbue each other over epochs and lead to one conclusion: it is futile and wrong to look for the meaning of existence in differences and divisions. Instead, it should be pursued in sparkling moments of understanding and unity which have almost always led to spiritual and material wellbeing and creation of great and powerful cultures and civilizations. It is this attitude indeed towards the use and misuse of an increasing power which will define most of the future Muslim-Jewish relations, as well as of the entirety of relations in the world.
Power without true belief, morality and responsibility loses its basic function and turns into violence. All divine revelations, including the Qur'an, the Old and the New Testament, have emphasized the value of a righteous leader. The Almighty God bestowed a unique power upon Sulaiman or Solomon, but warned him that power without responsibility and righteousness is nothing but a worthless violence. The Almighty God bestowed upon Davud or David a victory against a stronger and more powerful opponent in order to convince him that injustice and violence, regardless of their impact, cannot lead to a durable victory. The remains, ruins of once mighty civilizations and cultures are nothing but an advice to contemporary man that any instance of misuse of power leads to an inevitable disaster.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Islam and Judaism testify a belief in one and the only God who does not have a companion. The essence of belief is the same for Muslims and Jews alike.
The most important Jewish festivity Passover celebrates their departure from Egypt, i.e. the salvation from the unjust and Godless ruler. The Muslims count time from the Hijra, i.e. from the day when they departed from the blasphemous and violent community. Therefore, those who seek true friendship between the Jews and Muslims, rightly, ask themselves how comes that the peoples whose core belief is the same, and who have been exposed to so much injustice and violence, cannot find a shared word based on the Word of God, and establish a lasting peace? Fortunately, links between the Muslims and Jews have been more encompassing and stronger than the differences and disputes between them. Such differences and disputes started in the first half of the 20th century, and have reached their climax nowadays. Radicalization of events and resorting to violence as an ultimate solution will not bring about enhancement of the Muslim-Jewish relations worldwide. “All people are equal, as equal as the teeth of a comb”. This Hadith Mohammad Alaihissalam, Messenger of God, points to man’s undeniable responsibility for efforts not made towards achieving equality amongst people, and thus for a lasting peace everywhere and at all times. Peace that we constantly refer to and advocate by greeting each other with Salam and Shalom is a universal value and a shared responsibility of all people.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is, in the European and global terms alike, an example of how Muslims and Jews can live together in unity, while respecting and accepting their mutual differences and using mutual similarities. In the times of increasingly aggressive forms of antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of religious and cultural intolerance, the Muslims and Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina have continued to nurture mutual respect and tolerance. That was how it was in the past, too.
In the course of the appalling persecution the Jews were exposed to in the Second World War, the Muslims saved their Jewish neighbours selflessly. All of us are proud of a considerable number of the Bosnian Muslims honoured as the Righteous among the Nations in the Yad Vashem Museum.
However, it was not only the human lives that were saved then. It was also the culture and heritage of the indigenous Bosnian and Herzegovinian people. On the two occasions, in 1942, and then in 1993, the Bosnian-Muslim intellectuals, both at positions of curators of the National Museum in Sarajevo, i.e. Dr Derviš Korkut and Dr Enver Imamović, preserved the Sarajevan Hagaddah, a valuable cultural evidence brought to Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Jews who had been expelled from Spain. Therefore, it is only natural that during the most recent aggression against our country the Jews, to whom Bosnia and Herzegovina has been the only homeland, were among the resistance leaders. Finally, I can bear witness myself on a deep connection between the Muslim and Jewish communities in Sarajevo, where I have been raised. The man I was named after was killed in the concentration camp together with his Jewish neighbours. Therefore, I have done all I could to support a sparse Jewish community. Certainly, without our Jewish community, Sarajevo and the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina would lose a part of their identity that others recognize and respect us for.
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen,
I am glad to see that most of one hundred and thirty participants of the Eighth Muslim-Jewish conference are young people. That is why I will end my today's address by delivering a message to them, who are the only true future of our mutual relations.
Talk to each other and look for paths to reach others. Do not abandon dialogue as long as there is a single person willing to listen to you.
Finally, all that is reflected by this world of ours and life in it, including thoughts, efforts, achievements, have strived to reach out to the opposite shore, to the other side to which it aims and where it gains its true meaning.
Remember the words of God set out in the Torah, and repeated in the Qur'an, that “the one who kills one innocent man acted as if he killed all of humanity, and the one who saves one innocent man acted as if he saved all of humanity“. Do defend innocent people and you will save humanity.
I extend my heartfelt welcome to you to Sarajevo and the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish you to have a successful conference, whose message is in encouraging mutual dialogue and understanding because that is the true nature of man. With these thoughts in mind, I declare this conference open."
76714,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member at the commemoration in Potočari",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=76714&langTag=en-US,2017-07-11,"Dear mothers of Srebrenica, dear people from the Podrinje area, esteemed guests,
Nothing but silence and prayer are appropriate on this very day at this very site.
However, the time we have lived in demands that we speak out – raise our voice and respond to those who have not understood yet, or do not want to understand, a scary message of the genocide committed here.
It is well known what happened here in summer of 1995.
Pursuant to many years when they were conducting the siege, the death squads of the malefactors Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić crashed resistance of the exhausted defenders and executed thousands of previously detained Bosniak men and boys in order to exterminate entirely the existence of one people in this area.
What was it and against whom that those boys and elderly men, who were executed mercilessly, of whom each and single one had defended their families and bare lives, did wrong? The answers to these questions will remain secrets hidden forever in the dark abyss of the malefactors' souls who executed them.
The entire guilt of the 15 year old Damir Suljić and the 72 two year old Alija Salihović was that they were Muslims, Bosniaks, and that both of them were born in Srebrenica. Džemila Mahmutović, in addition to the same guilt as Damir and Alija, was also guilty of being loyal to her brothers and male relatives, with whom she stayed, and refused to leave them behind even when she was faced with death approaching all of them.
We do know that the United Nations remained mute and passive. For days they used to receive precise data on massacres which were in progress, they had satellite images of the mass graves which were constantly growing. However, cowardly, they surrendered the “UN safe area“ to the total slaughter, which would be remembered as the United Nation's unfinest hour and one of the darkest moments in human civilization.
The conscience of the malefactors has never been awakened. They have continued, even now, as well as in the course of the previous 22 years, hiding and negating the crime they committed here.
However, the conscience of the civilized world, after the initial shock it suffered, was activated after all.
Both international and domestic courts have faced the horrors of brutal executions, mass graves, but also the perversion of the ideology which had ordered such crimes to be committed. They called it and judged on it by assigning it the only name possible – genocide.
The gruesome experience of Srebrenica has posed serious challenges and difficult questions before all of us who witnessed it. It sometimes seems to us as if there are no answers to those questions and challenges.
However, there must be answers!
The answers lie in the future filled with life and peace. The path to such future leads through reconciliation.
Reconciliation is needed by all – both ourselves and the future generations.
It is needed in order to ensure that never again any single mother in Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to look for the bones of her children throughout any mass graves.
However, one issue needs to be clear to all – there can be no reconciliation and better future in Bosnia and Herzegovina without justice and truth.
For, truth is the only supporter when one is faced with difficult challenges. We keep facing such challenges each time when the word Srebrenica is uttered. It will not be before we get strengthened by the truth that we will be able to resist such challenges.
The foundations of reconciliation must be built upon justice and truth. No reconciliation is possible if based on lies, denial of the genocide, relativization, provocations such as those we once again, witnessed prior to this anniversary. The reconciliation and better future will not take place until the ideology which created the genocide in Srebrenica is defeated entirely.
Therefore, it is today that from this sacred site we, once again, invite the Serb people and its political, religious and intellectual elites to accept the truth and cease to deny the genocide which was committed here – to, finally, make that step forward to a true reconciliation and a better future for all of us.
The truth requests from the Serb people not to invest their trust into those who offer them any artificial myths, those who lead them into conflicts, those who need that people only as accomplices or silent supporters in crime.
Such people, unfortunately, are still present. They continue to deny the genocide, decorate war criminals, adding salt to the survivors' wounds by doing so. Furthermore, they continue to threaten daily by secession of a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is our message to them that they will not succeed in such endeavour. We will never allow that Srebrenica, Tomašica, Brčko, Zvornik and all other sites of horrific crimes against the innocent Bosnian people be anything but Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is requested from the international community to ensure that the horrible lesson of summer 1995 should be learned in order to prevent any future Srebrenicas. While contemplating with anxiety on everything happening in today's world, I fear that such lesson, unfortunately, has not been learned fully.
Srebrenica is the deepest wound for the Bosniaks and they will never forget it. The violence they were exposed to demands that they detest the idea of any violent revenge, and they have detested it indeed. It is difficult to find any peoples in the world against whom such horrific crimes, including genocide, were committed, and who, nevertheless, succeeded in overcoming a drive for revenge thanks to their internal being and their spiritual strength. It is good that our position on revenge has been like that because any revenge would lead us into a vicious circle, from which there would be no way out. Justice and truth must be, and have been indeed, our only revenge.
Therefore, we will never quit our struggle for truth and justice.
Srebrenica was the scene of a horrific tragedy first. Then, it was a stage of speechless grief. It should become a reconciliation site in the future. It depends exclusively from readiness to accept the truth and discard lies whether the citizens of the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Srebrenica, will start living in the prosperous future focused on life and peace, or whether such future will remain our unreachable dream."
76872,"Speech delivered by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member at the opening of the First posthumous retrospective exhibition of Mersad Berber’s paintings, Vijećnica, 6 July 2017",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=76872&langTag=en-US,2017-07-07,"At the start of all our roads there is a clearly marked path at which a man stood up for the first time and started walking. At one such path, and there is an indefinite number of them in Bosnia, each one of us based his vision on wealth, beauty, and on the meaning of the world and life. On all paths one travels later in life, in all remote places scattered all over the world, most of our people draw their inspiration from that very first image conceived on some Bosnian path while they learned their first steps.
Dear members of the Berber family, your excellences, eminences, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
At the start of all our roads there is a clearly marked path at which a man stood up for the first time and started walking. At one such path, and there is an indefinite number of them in Bosnia, each one of us based his vision on wealth, beauty, and on the meaning of the world and life. On all paths one travels later in life, in all remote places scattered all over the world, most of our people draw their inspiration from that very first image conceived on some Bosnian path while they learned their first steps.
Ladies and gentlemen,
One of the most important painting exhibitions in the last half a century is now before you. It is an example of a magnificent artistic perception of condensed history and cultural heritage of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as a testimony on a long and complex path travelled by the renowned artist Mersad Berber.
Only he and his family know how difficult and demanding that path he travelled was. However, one is certain, as it was said nicely by one of the leading thinkers of our times Peter Sloterdijk: “A man becomes man by choosing a more difficult path”.
And how many such paths are scattered throughout Bosnia which Meša Selimović, Mak Dizdar, Ivo Andrić, Aleksa Šantić, Nedžad Ibrišimović, Roman Petrović, Ibrahim Ljubović, Gabrijel Jurkić passed through? How many paths are there which, like the Zmijanje embroidery, wind through Bosnia, lending themselves to our sons and grandsons to learn to walk and stand up?
Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
The position of my country has led to permeation of different cultures and civilizations, leading to an unquestionable ethno-cultural intertwining and interdependence of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
If there is anything certain in Bosnia, if history has taught us anything, then it is that our best people have remained loyal to their country at all times: ”Loyal to God, loyal to Bosnia”, as late noble Friar Petar Anđelović said.
“At moments, when in a foreign country, in which I lived due to bad circumstances and kept myself alive by miracle”, says Bosnian and Herzegovinian Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić in his memories, “piously, as a believer spreads his prayer carpet, I spread before me a hard and lofty Višegrad’s path along which I walked out into the world. That very path was the only one which cured all pain and eased all suffering.”
The work of Mersad Berber, like a windy, hard path conceived seventy years ago in Bosanski Petrovac, testifies on exactly that wealth and diversity of our culture, as well as on the climate we live in all its hardship and beauty alike.
Thus, for every person from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from birth to death, there is an obliging rule and motto – that all of us are indebted to our homeland as long as we live. Mersad Berber bestowed a lot to his Bosnia and Herzegovina. He repaid his debt. Actually, by repaying his debt to his homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina, he has never left it.
For, a human life is indeed nothing but a persistent returning to that path a man learned to walk on, and from which, really, that man never steps down.
Your excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
It is with great honour that I am the patron of this unique cultural event – the First posthumous retrospective exhibition of Mersad Berber’s paintings – Allegory of Bosnia, which we present, with our hearts full of joy, to all citizens of Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina tonight at this hall of the Bosnian culture and tradition, which we restored and raised from the ashes.
Thank you."
75750,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member on the occasion of marking the 25th jubilee of the Special Police Unit “Lasta“",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=75750&langTag=en-US,2017-05-12,"Dear member of the Special Police Unit “Lasta“, dear friends, as-salāmu ʿalaykum, and good afternoon,
It has been twenty five years since the Sarajevan “Laste“ (Swallows) started their warpath. That path was motivated by defending the right to life, to freedom, to equality of all citizens of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
While preparing this address, I remembered an event which I attended and memorized clearly at the time.
In 1994, two years after the Unit “Laste“ was founded, the Armed Forces of RBiH commander-in-chief late Alija Izetbegović handed over the war flag to the unit commander Mr Rusmir Mrković. Even now I hear the sound of Alija's words echoing as if uttered this morning. There was some fatherly care in these words, as well as the warrior's pride, given that there were best sons of our homeland affected by the aggression who were standing before him then.
“Do not forget“, said Alija Izetbegović then, “you can say with pride that at these both difficult and glorious times you were with your people. The people trust you. Do everything in your power to preserve that trust earned in the most difficult of circumstances. Such trust is the highest recognition one can receive indeed. “
Our president, our commander-in-chief Alija Izetbegović was referred to by these famous words of Richard Holbrooke: “If it were not for Alija Izetbegović, Bosnia would not exist today! “. Let me be more precise today and amend this Holbrooke's statement in the following way: “Were it not for the courageous guys like you and the units like “Laste”, who followed the political wisdom and estimates of Alija Izetbegović, were it not for such amalgam of the young and the old age, of wisdom and courageousness, there would not have been Bosnia and Herzegovina! “.
Twenty years later, we live in the times of difficult political and economic reforms which we must implement on our path to the European Union.
It sometimes seems that in such arduous daily political life, in the course of the political efforts which we have invested, the images of the war-related past have faded away, including the great and moving moments like the said meeting of the commander-in-chief and his elite unit. It seems that under the burden of daily responsibilities and pressures we tend to forget how expensive each piece of Bosnia defended by you actually is.
However, let me assure you that we will not get tired, we will not accept to forget. The reason why we cannot do that is each one out of the fifty six members of the “Laste” unit who did not return to their nests, to their families. The opponents of Bosnia and Herzegovina will get tired. We will not do so. That is my message to you today. We do not have the right to get tired, to forget, to become complaisant as being complaisant may lead to relativization of truth on our struggle.
Dear friends,
The “Laste” unit is an image of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the overall BiH Army, composed of all patriots of this country, regardless of their religious or national affiliation. The names of Saša Petrović, Toni Badrov, Slavko Andžić, Darko Polunić have testified, and will continue to testify, how sincere and spontaneous that gathering was. In the name of those golden guys who, in the decisive moments - when faced with a dividing line between survival and disappearance, laid down their lives for their homeland, we cannot and will not allow the memory of their sacrifice and courageousness to fade away, and that the generations who now grow up think that the benefits of peace and freedom, which they possess and enjoy today, have been achieved or inherited in an easy way.
Therefore, in all our future efforts, we will drive our strength from that memory of the heroes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They must be woven into each detail, into each step forward which we make. While moving ahead, we must be aware that change and prevalence in historic events are always brought about by small groups of courageous people.
Finally, let me share with you a short definition in order to remind ourselves of the essence of the war path of your unit: this was a unit without any stain on its path, without any doubt cast on it, without any crime committed or non-military behaviour exercised. It is there that the main difference between you and your enemies lie. They wanted one nation and one-mindedness, whereas you opted for democracy and multiethnicity. You opted for a possibility that peoples of different faiths and nations continue to live together. You defended the idea and the very being of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is your identification card, the identification card of each and every one of you. You can and should be proud of it.
Dear friends, dear stouthearted good guys, I hereby extend my congratulations to you for this valuable jubilee, with my best wishes that in the near future we will make Bosnia and Herzegovina such state and society that you were fighting for!
May you live long and prosper."
75758,"Address of Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member delivered at the International Symposium “Middle way in religion, culture and politics – a thought on balance and moderation in the works of Alija I",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=75758&langTag=en-US,2017-05-12,"Esteemed Reisu-l-ulema of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed President of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe Mr Locker, esteemed Working Presidency of this scientific event, esteemed participants, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen!
It is my great honour to be with you at the opening of the International scientific symposium “The middle way in religion, culture and politics - a thought on balance and moderation in the works of Alija Izetbegović“. I hereby express my gratitude to those who initiated and organized the symposium for their noble idea and efforts invested in it. Furthermore, I hereby extend my thanks to all participants who, through their presentations, will contribute to a further scientific research of the works of a thinker and a statesman Alija Izetbegović.
One of the key thoughts in the context of confirmation of both balance and moderation in the works of Alija Izetbegović can be found in his book “Islam between the East and the West“. It refers to face off and reconciliation between the religious and the materialistic concepts, which have been the cornerstones in the ideological perception of the world. “It has always seemed to me“, said Alija Izetbegović, “sometimes more and sometimes less clearly, that the main message of religion is responsibility which cannot be avoided“. The skill to find a middle way in reconciling these two concepts was to become the main feature of Alija Izetbegović as a thinker and a statesman alike. His acknowledgement that doubts of the young age, triggered by the communist teachings on religion as “the opiate of the masses“ actually contributed to the firmness of his personal conviction that “the Universe without God is both impossible and meaningless“ lent itself as an evidence that Alija Izetbegović never distorted such balance of facing off. Re-recognition of faith, questioning, and raising the level of responsibility as the main feature of religion, would not be possible without the omnipresent materialistic counterthesis.
Moreover, in the “Islamic Declaration“, the work which has been attacked and defended with equally passionately by its respective attackers and defenders, the idea which dominates the text refers to the responsibility of Muslims to do something for their own history. However, on the other hand, as confirmed by the contemporary interpretations of this work, the responsibility as the main message of religion has been consistently incorporated in the core of the materialistic and social justice - by means of demanding more rights for Muslim women, protection of the weak, enhancement of the rights of minorities, etc. It is today that we can understand that, regardless of how much this book annoyed the Yugoslav ideological and political elites, it was, to the same extent, not in accordance with the Islamic conservative circles at the time because, through the model of Islamic understanding of responsibility, it opened numerous social justice-focused issues. Peacemaking is not an excuse for cowardness, dedication of the Muslim women to their homes and families does not lead to their passivity or the lack of access to their rights, rejection of one's own culture and tradition in exchange for faddism of the Western civilization does not mean progress by default. It is exactly the contrary indeed. In this regard the examples of Japan and Turkey have remained classic ones in the modern history. Namely, both these countries used to be empires respectively, each with its glorious past, and they used to be at approximately the same level of development and equal opportunities for the future. The reforms took place in both countries respectively then. In order to continue to live its own, and not someone else's life, Japan reconciled its tradition with progress. The Turkish “modernistst“ chose an opposite direction for Turkey. At the time of writing the “Islamic Declaration“ in the seventies of the previous century, Alija Izetbegović noticed that Turkey at the time was a “third-rate country“, whereas Japan grew into one of the world's leading nations.
“Can a country which does not know who it is and where its roots lie have a clear idea on where it is going and on what it should try to achieve“, wondered Alija Izetbegović in his “Islamic Declaration“. He provided an answer, which the comprehensive interpretations of his work, with a good reason, portray as a pattern for understanding of “the other and the different“, and of the way in which such relation need to be managed and should be managed indeed. In the “Islamic Declaration“ there is almost nothing of corresponding to the reason for which Alija Izetbegović was sentenced and imprisoned. However, there are a few definitions defining, almost exactly, a clear curve of development of the modern Turkish state as we know it today. Cultural heritage is a manner in which a nation remembers and lasts throughout history. By rejecting its rich tradition, the Kemalist Turkey rejected its memory of the past.
Spiritual poverty was promptly transferred to the sphere of public works and to lives of most of the people. It looks as if the new generation of Turkish politicians, led by Tayyip Erdoğan, studied closely the pieces of advice provided by Alija Izetbegović. They reconciled the tradition and progress and brought Turkey into the circle of fastest growing world’s economies.
Pursuant to this example, we can plastically point to the essence of both philosophical and political discourse of Alija Izetbegović, which can be discerned more clearly and easily from the following examples: “The core of all human civilization and progress lies in continuation, and not in destruction or negation“. It is there that we can find the answer to all confusion of numerous international and regional officials who expected that the Serb barbarism and destruction of religious, cultural and scientific institutions and edifices in the period of the aggression against BiH would be responded to by the same measure. They were not surprised less by the commitment to multiculturalism demonstrated by Alija Izetbegović, or, more precisely, to his commitment to preserving Bosnianhood as a multicultural concept of life in Bosnia. The Western civilization, as well as domestic radical and conservative circles, listened in disbelief to the Bosnian Muslims' leader focusing his attention, in the midst of the war, to preservation of the Orthodox churches, as well as the Jewish prayer books, while he was claiming that the spirit of Bosnia was preserved most authentically in the language of her Franciscans.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We can flick through hundreds and hundreds of pages of the works of Alija Izetbegović, and yet the lessons which will be found by any objective and well-intended readers will be: responsibility, consistency, unity, gathering, compromise, always at a clear distance from extremism and radicalism. It is as if, while writing his books and managing often difficult, fateful processes, Alija Izetbegović always had on his mind the ayahs from the Qur'an in which the Creator bequeathed moderation as the final stage of human wisdom and achievement. That is the very “middle way in religion, culture and politics, a thought of balance and moderation in the works of Alija Izetbegović“ as defined by the organizers of this scientific event; that is the very “thought-focused key“ of Alija Izetbegović, which has unmistakingly opened doors to all his books, as well as to his achievements.
One cannot demonstrate Islamic belief while carrying out non-Islamic acts, one cannot prepare anything, govern in a non-Islamic way, said Alija Izetbegović in the final part of his “Islamic Declaration“, while pointing his finger to such disharmony, a disbalance between words and deeds in which the whole reality of today's world may sink. Thus, such “middle way“ and “moderation“ exist only in harmony between the two mentioned demands – responsibility and consistency.
While he was imprisoned in Foča and Zenica, Alija Izetbegović was most horrified at the merciless communist censorship, which annulled even most fundamental human rights, including, first of all, the right to truth. Years later, in the besieged Sarajevo during the war, Alija Izetbegović responded to numerous remarks made by his interlocutors that “journalists write whatever they want in the war situation, and this sort of writing should be limited“ by stating that it was in the silence of the Foča prison that he took an oath to himself that he would never be in favour of bans of such kind.
“Even when I was faced with a possibility to spend the rest of my life in prison and die there among the convicts“, said Alija Izetbegović in his book “Memories“, “I reminded myself of the fundamental oath: consistency“. These two demands support and hold in balance, in harmony, what Alija Izetbegović was thinking and doing.
The meaning of the word Islam is translated from the Arabic to our language as: “commitment, peace, reconciliation“ - reconciliation with God, with fate, with people, as well as with everything that surrounds and reaches us. Alija Izetbegović, as a man, as a father, as a thinker, as a statesman, as well as a prisoner, both testified and confirmed such reconciliation wholeheartedly and truly."
75511,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency member at the International Scientific Symposium “The Bosnian language over time“ in Zagreb",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=75511&langTag=en-US,2017-04-21,"Dear Mayor of Zagreb, esteemed organizers of the International Symposium on the Bosnian language, esteemed participants, guests, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, Let me extend my sincere greetings to all of you on the occasion of the opening of the Symposium on the Bosnian language, which has gathered a significant number of participants from the whole region.
The issue of language is one of the most important features of each people's identity. Language has always been a symbol and always a re-confirmation of both one people's spiritual being and their ethnic belonging. Language, as a poet put it, is “a real homeland of the specific people“. This definition is very simple and it represents a national model which has been functioning in Europe, with certain variations, since the mid-19th century. Struggling to preserve one's own language has often meant struggling to preserve the whole of a specific culture or, in the opposite, its inevitable assimilation and melting into other national groups. The Hungarians stand for a particular example of such model of preserving one's own identity through radical preservation of purity of their language. They preserved their language to such extent that nowadays there are almost no words of foreign origin in it.
The Bosniaks have remained committed to their language. Namely, from the late 15th century to the early 20th century they created literary works in the Oriental languages, too. Such languages, except at the level of usage of specific words and names, have never reached wide public and have not affected the purity of the mother Bosnian tongue.
Close to three hundred authors from that period left behind their works of various genres, in which, without exception, the language of the residents of Bosnia was called the Bosnian language.
Furthermore, many hundreds of authors from that time added to their name the reference Bosnavi/Bosnali/Bosniak/Bosnian, which underlined their powerful and durable connectedness with the motherland - Bosnia.
In the course of the four centuries of the Ottoman rule, our people never forgot or abandoned their language, and never forgot their homeland.
However, the Bosnian language has never been the language of Bosniaks, Bosnian Muslims only. There have been numerous examples in literary and historical sources of the presence of the Bosnian language in use by other Bosnians.
The key Croat writers in BiH- Matija Divković, Ivan Franjo Jukić, Anto Knežević, and others also called it the Bosnian language respectively.
Friar Pavle Dragičević, the Bishop of Duvno wrote in 1735 that there were nine priests in Bosnia who used “the Bosnian language“ to assist them in performing the religious ceremonies because they did not understand the Church Slavonic language well enough.
The Herzegovinian Orthodox leaders, including Prokopije Čokorilo, asked Ali-Pasha Rizvanbegović to appoint such Bishop who should be a man “adept in the Bosnian language“ It was back in 1881 that the Bosnian Bishop Vujičić called this language Bosnian.
In 1894 the Franciscans sent official letters replying to their opponents that they did not speak Serbian language, and that they spoke Bosnian instead.
It was not sooner than in 1907 that the Bosnian language was withdrawn temporarily from the official use in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was done by the Austro-Hungarian Government for BiH in 1907. However, the Bosnian language has not been withdrawn for a single moment from the life of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Why was the Bosnian language so widespread and accepted among the people? This was because it was based on the old heritage language, i.e. on the language we found as the primary source on the mediaeval Bosnian tombstones (stećak).
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Language, as defined by the European national movements in the mid-19th century, defines national borders. Therefore, accepting the existence of the Bosnian language is the ultimate obstacle to some greater states-focused ambitions at the expense of BiH, of her cultural and territorial integrity. This is a stigma which has followed the Bosniaks throughout the 20th century, in the period of compromiseless and destructive unitarism carried out by the Karađorđević' dynasty, as well as in the period of the Yugoslav communist utopia, whose pattern of equality and equal access to rights, in its essence, maintained the Euro-centric national distinctiveness model. Initially, in the course of the Anti Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) session in Jajce, the Bosniaks had been recognized as the distinctive people, as the sixth flame in the coat of arms symbolizing the respective peoples within the new state community of South Slavs. However, it was then by the Constitution of 1945 that they first lost their constitutiveness again, and then they lost the right to their language
The so-called 1954 “Novi Sad“ agreement on a shared language only reaffirmed the imposed constitutional changes.
The working group, in which three BiH representatives participated, including the Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić, concluded that the Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins were using the Serbo-Croatian language.
The Bosniaks, given that they lost their constitutiveness by the Constitution of 1945, were not even registered within the new Yugoslav language reality.
Fortunately, the Bosniak intellectuals, including Alija Isaković with his demonstrated uniqueness and persistence for example, have never accepted such imposed reality.
By the 1990 democratic changes, followed by the 1992-1995 defence and liberation war, in which independence of the state of BiH was renewed, the Bosniaks restored both their constitutiveness and the right to their Bosnian language, as one of the three languages in the official use now. The fact that almost 53% of the overall population in BiH speaks Bosnian today is encouraging indeed.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
The international symposium on the Bosnian language in Zagreb is one in a series of attempts undertaken over many decades by the Bosniak associations and institutions, aimed at finally affirming the Bosnian language officially, too, or, to put it more precisely, to ensure its systemic and organized teaching and learning in the Republic of Croatia.
Therefore, this symposium should contribute to a faster implementation of the Bosnian language in the curricula in the Republic of Croatia.
It is unacceptable that the Bosniaks, who are the second largest national minority in Croatia, do not have their mother tongue available in primary and secondary schools by any model, with the exception of the Islamic Secondary School “Dr Ahmed Smajlović“. It is obvious that assistance from the competent institutions has been insufficient to a necessary extent which would ensure the implementation of such objective. A lack of bilateral agreement between the two countries on the protection of rights of the Bosniak minority has certainly contributed to such situation. Such bilateral agreements have been signed with the neighbouring countries for their minorities in the Republic of Croatia. These issues can be resolved in a relatively short period. In my own capacity, I will aim to address these issues in my further discussions with the Croatian colleagues. What has been encouraging to a certain extent is that Zagreb and the Republic of Croatia are open for a discussion on the Bosnian language, as demonstrated by this symposium under the auspices of the Mayor of the City of Zagreb, and with the participation of the important persons from the Croatian academic community.
Finally, it is also a moral responsibility of the Republic of Croatia to make necessary steps to ensure that the Bosnian language becomes adequately represented in the official curricula. Let us not forget that the Bosniaks contributed to the defence and creation of the modern Croatian state with over 25,000 Bosniak defenders; 1,187 Bosniaks who got killed, as well as several thousands Bosniaks who got severely wounded in the process. All this constitutes our shared commitment and connectedness.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Let me extend my congratulations to the organizers of the International symposium on the Bosnian language for their courageousness, and for their persistence to address this difficult issue in the struggle for a full affirmation of the Bosnian language in the Republic of Croatia. To the participants and patrons of this event I owe my sincere gratitude for recognizing and supporting such idea.
It is my sincere wish that this symposium
I wish this symposium to meet the expectations concerned, as well as its set objectives. Let me extend my sincere greetings to all of you, and wish you all best.
Thank you."
74880,"Media statements by Dr Mladen Ivanić, Chairman of BiH Presidency and Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74880&langTag=en-US,2017-03-06,"Generally speaking, a message for the region and the international community is that there are two states in this area – i.e. Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have affirmed good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation as an example, and we invite all those who see this example as a good one to follow it fully, while we will continue, in the spirit of good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation, to maintain a full closeness and effectiveness of such cooperation.
Dr Mladen Ivanić, Chairman of BiH Presidency:
It is my pleasure to extend our welcome to Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro have had best relations possible. I believe that ours are best bilateral relations within the region as, practically, we do not have a single open issue between us. We were the first ones who signed the Border Agreement without any particular problems, thus putting an end to the issue which has always been sensitive in this area. We have shared views on many issues both within and beyond the region. Discussions on the issue of the agreement on social insurance have been close to their final phase. Most of benefits covered by this agreement should be enjoyed by the citizens of both countries concerned. I hope that we will finalize it relatively shortly. There is a very high level indeed of mutual understanding and mutual support. We are very glad that Montenegro has made some significant steps forward, that it has started a serious economic development, and that it has been getting closer to the European Union. I believe that, in a way, it is one of the serious motors in the region, which drives it in the EU direction. We have discussed today a need to engage ourselves a bit more in some infrastructure projects, which are not only our shared topic, but the topic of other countries in the region, too. Such discussion includes the Adriatic-Ionian Motorway. Furthermore, there is a discussion on the pipeline which should start from Azerbaijan, and one of its branches would be installed through these areas. Better connectedness of the countries in terms of infrastructure is another shared topic we discussed. In particular, following a suggestion of Mr Vujanović, we will think very seriously on an option to have the border crossings between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro with practically one border control point per crossing only, i.e. to have one joint instead of two border control points per crossing, thus demonstrating to people who travel how good our relations are. I have to underline that this is the idea of President Vujanović, but I believe that we will do something on that issue, too. Therefore, this is a very pleasant visit. It is our pleasure to host President Vujanović in Sarajevo. We had a very pleasant discussion and a high level of shared views on practically all issues discussed.
Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro:
Esteemed Chairman Ivanić, dear Mladen, let me extend my thanks once again for the invitation, a cordial welcome and, as always, an open, constructive, and very friendly discussion. Namely, we have indeed, as you said, affirmed the position of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina as a good example in the region, i.e. as a good example in terms of both our good neighbourly relations and good regional cooperation. We have succeeded in resolving all issues. There is no single open issue between us, whereas there is a wide room still open for our further cooperation. It is our shared responsibility from the presidential level to encourage it – to make it comprehensive at the level of the two governments concerned, and, at the level of entrepreneurs, to make it economically effective. We concluded the State Border Agreement, which is the first agreement of this kind between any two countries of former Yugoslavia, thus showing that a sensitive issue could be resolved by an agreement between the two countries, without any external agency. Furthermore, we concluded a series of necessary agreements on cooperation in all fields, together with the latest agreement on cooperation in the field of European integration, in which we agreed that we would do everything together in order to enhance the progress along the path towards the European integration of both our countries respectively. We have made progress on this issue. However, we are ready to do everything we can to enhance further the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We extend our congratulations to the Presidency and the Government for truly impressive progress achieved on the European integration process. We also express our expectations to you because we have communicated a message to the European Union to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina a candidate status by the end of this year or the beginning of the next year. We have achieved success through the implementation of the specific shared cooperation. However, there is a lot of room for our extended cooperation. At the bilateral level and in the spirit of good neighbourly relations alike, we must do everything we can to ensure that such cooperation is of highest possible quality. Within the regional organization of initiatives, we have really had a full and excellent cooperation. For example, within the Presidential initiative Brdo Brioni, which in many aspects initiated a renewed attitude of the European Union towards the Western Balkans region, such excellent cooperation was obvious. Furthermore, within the Belgium process, in which governments have exercised a high quality cooperation, but also within CEFTA, we have worked together to enhance mobility of goods and people and improve economic environment to enable further cooperation. Chairman Ivanić mentioned the specific projects we discussed. I believe that we must make use of that activity within the Belgium process, which provides an opportunity to implement regional projects in a high quality way, with the participation of the European Union member states, in the fields of road infrastructure and energy infrastructure. We have also discussed possibilities to enhance and encourage together the Adriatic-Ionian pipeline because that project does not have any problem of funding. In that sense, we have discussed a need for the two governments to cooperate more frequently and closely in order to achieve an even better quality of cooperation. We recently hosted a visit paid by Mr Denis Zvizdić, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and had very concrete discussions. I will have a meeting with him later today. I am grateful to the Chairman for making this initiative public – our interest in border crossings with one border control post per crossing only. This model is very efficient. We have one such border crossing post with Albania. The effect of control of illegal trade is best there, whereas the satisfaction of those crossing the border is full because they face smallest of obstacles. Therefore, generally speaking, a message for the region and for the international community is that there are two countries in this area – i.e. Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have affirmed their good neighbourly relations and the regional cooperation as an example. We invite all those who see this example as a good one to follow it closely. We will continue, in the spirit of good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation, to nurture full closeness and efficiency of such cooperation.

74815,"Speech delivered by Dr Dragan Čović, the Croat member of BiH Presidency to mark the occasion of the 1st of March, the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74815&langTag=en-US,2017-03-02,"Your Excellences, Eminences, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen! It is my pleasure to address you today on this day which invites all of us to renew an intra-societal dialogue and commit more strongly to the idea of our homeland as a community of its constitutive peoples and all others who do not declare themselves like that, the community of equals who have the same rights.
All those fears that we experienced 25 years ago on the eve of the referendum itself, all the doubts and discussions on the wording of the referendum question, even back then exposed all the weaknesses of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, as we witness, are still following us today: political immaturity, mutual distrust, rejection of constructive dialogue as the only path to achieving inclusive vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suited for all of us who perceive it as their homeland.
We all have to find the strength to look at events from the past in a way that does not burden our relations today, in a way that does not undermine the ability of thinking about common future. We need to have a much more courage, self-criticism and the strength to admit our own mistakes. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an abstract idea. It is made out of social fabric, the groups that are living here for centuries; three traditional communities - the three constituent peoples and all others who care to nurture their language, culture, identity and uniqueness.
To glorify and celebrate BiH means to glorify and celebrate its people, their communities, but also everything else that defines them. The interest of any nation in BiH is not above the interests of BiH, as the sum of the interests of all its peoples. Our country is hostage today to issues of whose BiH is it, which parts of it belong more to whom, who is more equal, more thorough, more qualified, more important, better. I am deeply convinced, and I can assure you that we all want it equally, but not in any state.
We would BiH that is just, in which each nation has secured an institutional position and subjectivity, to elect their political representatives, manages its identity and all that is important for its maintenance in the areas of culture, information, public, education, economy, entrepreneurship and standards.
Tonight, as we celebrate independence of our Bosnia and Herzegovina, I invite partners in government to make a step towards the amendments of the electoral law. Croatian political representatives, gathered by the Croatian National Congress, have offered acceptable solutions that address the merits of the decisions of national and international judicial institutions, in the spirit of everything that what we had in mind when we went out in the 1992 on the referendum polls, to support the vision of an independent and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a state of equal peoples, established to suit us all.
On this occasion, I also invite all those who shape public opinion to responsibly understand their role in building a healthier social and political environment. We have to be even stronger in strengthening of everything that binds us, in settling our relationships, removing tensions. I responsibly claim, there is no need for anyone to feel uncertainty and redundancy in this beautiful country, to say its name with apprehension and anxiety, to express their religious or national affiliation.
If in these times, full of trials, we succeed to maintain a common dialogue in the wake of a general consensus on the European future of BiH and its pluralistic multi-national and multi-cultural character, we will come to the stage of viability, which will include the ability to run this country and decide on all issues without outside help or coercion. Let us not seek role models and protectors beyond the country, but let us turn to each other. Let us use our freedom in the interest of unity and equality. Let us be responsible and respect the institutions whose credibility we are painstakingly building for years.
Dear friends,
to all of you gathered here tonight, and to all the residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I congratulate you Independence Day of our homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I wish you all the best and cheers."
74566,"Address by Dr Mladen Ivanić, Chairman of BiH Presidency on the occasion of the opening of “The BiH Economic Forum 2017“ organized by the Faculty of Economics in Sarajevo",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74566&langTag=en-US,2017-02-09,"Esteemed participants, let me, first of all, extend my congratulations to you on the idea to organize this kind of forum. This is a great opportunity for the executive authorities, academic public, people from the economic field, who create business environment and work in it, to share views on an adequate business-friendly environment which should be established.
BiH needs to dedicate more time and attention to the field of economics, which is a precondition for development. If we continue to focus on politics only, without turning towards economics, we will continue to be confined to the current position. Instead, we need to make giant steps forward in order to create an environment worth investing in.
BiH must change her political and economic image. There are issues which are not bad, but there has not been much discussion on these.
Regardless of criticism, we have a stable currency. It is important that it remains stable, that no experiments are made with the Central Bank of BiH, with money printing or anything similar. If this would be done, the ultimate consequence would be both inflation growth and currency instability in BiH.
The essence of economic reforms should be to reduce importance of the public sector. The share of beaurocracy and administration in GDP is too high, while there is not enough investment, particularly from the real sector.
Creating a favourable environment should be a priority. Tax rates should be reduced, while the monetary system stability should be maintained, and such conditions created that would ensure repayment of investments in a faster and easier way.
I do not refer to foreign investment only, but to domestic one, too. There will be no foreign investment as long as domestic investment does not raise profit.
The environment should be improved because the unemployment rate is still high. In the course of the previous year, there was one embassy which issued more than 15,000 working visas alone. There was no job for these recipients of the working visas so that they were forced to look for it outside BiH.
If we do not change something, such situation will become our durable prospect. We have avoided the reform of both pension and health care systems, and it is these reforms that are essential for improvement of the situation.
We have turned towards the economic reforms thanks to the British-German initiative. However, but we have lacked our own initiatives. That is why this forum is good, where the speakers are local people, with no external intermediaries. I am looking forward to hearing optimistic messages.
I declare the Forum open."
74299,"1995 Genocide against the Bosniaks“ Project launch, Sarajevo, 12 January 2017",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74299&langTag=en-US,2017-01-13,"It was the idea of late Alija Izetbegović that a book which would contain a comprehensive registry of crimes committed against the Bosniaks in the previous war should be made. In the late 1996 he presented this idea to Amor Mašović, suggesting he led a team of the book co-authors. However, Amor Mašović judged that it was still too early, that an important part of evidence material and documentation were not available yet at the time. Twenty years later, in the autumn of 2016, I discussed this issue again with Amor Mašović, and with the representatives of the Institute for Research of Crimes against Humanity and International Law. This time the idea was accepted.
Esteemed defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed Grand Mufti Kavazović, esteemed representatives of the churches and religious communities in BiH, esteemed Parliament members, prime ministers, heads of municipalities, mayors, ladies and gentlemen,
Esselamu Aleykum and good evening to you.
Thank you for attending this event. It is not easy to face again the images of horror which devastated our people in the course of the latest aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. I extend my particular gratitude to the heroes present here, as well as to the families of the heroes who are not with us tonight. They risked and lost their lives while defending their innocent and unarmed people's right to life and survival. Without them, evil would have won. Without them then, there would not have been us, and there would not have been any Bosnia and Herzegovina now. The genocide would have been completed. Our people would have been extinguished.
The idea on a book which would contain a comprehensive registry of crimes committed against the Bosniaks in the course of the most recent war originates from late Alija Izetbegović. In the late 1996 he presented this idea to Amor Mašović, suggesting to him to lead a team of co-authors who would make such book. However, Mašović judged that it was too early, that an important part of evidence material and documentation were not available yet. Twenty years later, in the autumn of 2016, I discussed this issue again with Amor Mašović, and with the representatives of the Institute for Research of Crimes against Humanity and International Law. The idea was accepted this time.
The aim of the project is to establish a database which, in one place, down to the last detail, in a comprehensive and professional way, will register each crime, each victim, each perpetrator, all judgements, all testimonies and memories. The outcomes of this project are to create a truth-driven dark and bloody mosaic of genocide committed in order to extinguish one indigenous people from the territory they inhabited since the beginning of time; to preserve it from oblivion, manipulation and forgeries; to keep memory of victims alive, their faces, their life stories; to create a multimedia audio and visual presentation which will be easily accessible and available to all, and which will serve as remembrance and warning to both present and future generations.
Numbers are important indeed. They speak volumes. However, numbers alone are insufficient because people are not numbers. Each man is a specific world for himself, and it is with death of each man that the entire human species die anew.
The number of Srebrenica's 8,372 persons who were shot dead, would obtain its actual dimension and meaning after we see again the scenes of execution of the boys from Srebrenica committed by the “Scorpions“ unit, and when we try to imagine that all 8372 men and boys, each single one of them indeed, who used to be detained prior to being executed, had the same destiny and lived through the same suffering.
I was forced to listen and think about war crimes since my early childhood. Both my uncles - my mother's brothers - were killed at the Jasenovac Concentration Camp. My mother never stopped remembering them. As a middle-aged man, I was faced again with the horror of crimes committed against civilians, with the instances of ethnic cleansing and the genocide. I had to keep following a series of appalling news containing horrific details. I have tried to figure out what were the reasons behind these crimes. I have never succeeded in finding an answer to the question how is it possible for people to engage themselves en masse in torturing and killing innocent civilians, women and children.
A part of that reply was contained in the closing arguments made by prosecutor Alan Tieger in the trial against Ratko Mladić. The second part of the reply has been contained in the dark abyss of the perpetrators' souls. Prosecutor Tieger set out unemotional yet rational reasons for the genocide committed against the Bosniaks of Prijedor. He said that “... the genocide was a part of the wider objective, an organized effort aimed at reshaping the demographic structure of Bosnia... while it was clear that an ethnic division of ethnically mixed Bosnian population was not going to happen miraculously, but that severe crimes would need to be committed in order to achieve it... the genocide became the means aimed at achieving a permanent removal of non-Serbs from the targeted territories... this aim demanded from the military forces to create a new situation on the ground, which both the Muslims and the international community would be forced to accept... for, when in a place like Prijedor, in a short period, 1,500 people gets killed, thousands get starved, humiliated, tortured in appalling detention facilities, where they either died slowly or were brutally executed, when their homes were destroyed, mosques devastated, and when they got scattered penniless in the misery of exile... The real word describing these crimes, committed with such intention, is the word genocide...“.
Tieger emphasized in particular the murdering of reputable individuals, leaders in their communities, and the crime of mass rape as a method of shattering self-confidence of the attacked people, aimed at provoking a wave of ethnic cleansing. I quote: “... A group is not only a physical or a biological entity; its existence is based on the links established between its members, as well as on the factors of harmony which enable it to exist as a group... sexual violence has a destructive impact not only on direct victims, but also on their families, communities, and the groups as a whole... Such wider destructive impact is not the issue of physical destruction of some members of the group only, the aim is achieving destruction and dysfunctionality of family and social ties by means of sexual violence...“.
It is difficult to nurture painstakingly a collective memory of horrifying evil which devastated the Bosniaks in the recent past. However, we will have to remember it because those who forget risk that evil will be inflicted upon them again. We can forgive. However, we will never forget. Furthermore, we will never again be weak because it is weakness that invites those who are ruthless.
We need to and we will commit ourselves to working patiently on reconciliation. We will never by any means strive for revenge. Only the perpetrators need to be held to account, and they are the ones who must be punished.
Bosniaks and Serbs, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as those in Serbia, have lived together for centuries, and will continue to live together in the forthcoming centuries. Such shared living must not be poisoned by hatred and retaliation. However, it must be based on truth, on accepting the truth – no matter how bitter and hard the truth may be. Such shared living and peace will be stable and durable only if it gets built upon the solid foundations of truth and justice.
That was my recent answer to a diplomat of one friendly country, who expressed his concern that the event taking place this evening could be perceived as a provocation against the Serb side. I told him that the truth can never be a provocation against anyone.
Therefore, I will finish this address by quoting the words of God's Last Messenger, which talk about the Truth – “Truth brings about salvation, even when it seems that there is disaster in it; while lie brings about disaster, even when it seems that there is salvation in it“.
Thank you!"
74094,"Address by Dr Mladen Ivanić, Chairman of BiH Presidency at the Third Convention of the Coalition of the Marginalized Groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina - “KOMA“",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74094&langTag=en-US,2016-12-21,"Good afternoon to all and thanks to the organizers for inviting me. I believe that it is a giant step that you have made by establishing this coalition of the marginalized groups because there is not much which can be achieved by disunity. When united, you can and will achieve much more. I think that your presence will certainly make an impact not only on politics, but on media, too, and, let me add, on the society as a whole, too. You will affect us to pay more attention to this segment of our society, which we have not dealt with often enough.
As a politician, I have tried to find a way to communicate with you. Many of you I have seen here whom I used to meet with at the time when I was still the President of the Government, as well as subsequently. Once when one feels the problems these persons are facing, when one really feels it, then, no matter how thick-skinned that one is, he will not be able to forget such problems. It is sufficient to have one conversation conducted by a serious politician with these persons to ensure that the gravity of the problem gets understood by that politician.
The name marginalized groups is not a good one. That very name proves that it was not created in accordance with the will of the persons who belong to these groups. It was, instead, created in accordance with the will of the majority in the society. It was the majority, and not the group members themselves, who marginalized these groups. Such marginalization was partly based on taboos, partly on prejudices, and partly on many other reasons. Within each such group there are individuals, persons, their lives, happiness, suffering, sorrow, pain, problems and struggles they struggle with. Attention must be paid and importance attached to these persons continuously.
I sincerely believe that this is not a problem that politics can solve on its own. It is a problem of the society as a whole. The society does not pay enough attention to these persons. Here follow two examples illustrating this. First, last year, I presented some small technical device to the Association of the Blind in Banja Luka. No media representatives attended the event. Second, as the Chairperson in the new mandate, I received the representatives of the World Congress of the Persons with Deafness and Hearing Impairments. No one attended the event either, although all were invited. I used to try in the past to attach more importance to these issues. However, I have had an impression that the society is not ready yet to do this in a way which is sufficiently good, and sufficiently comprehensive, that we need much education indeed, as well as basic human culture to approach these issues. We need to ensure that we do not run away from these persons, hide, or ignore that the specific problem exists.
It is not important to ensure funding only, although funding is important indeed to improve the position of these persons. However, I believe that it is much more important to treat the persons who belong to the marginalized groups as normal members of the society, as individuals who have their respective roles in the society, as opposed to perceiving them as a burden.
When we know that the general framework is as I described it, and I believe that, objectively speaking, it is like that indeed, then your organization, approach, accompanied by the media and public civil pressure exercised against the dominant majority in the society may make necessary impact in order to bring about change of approach.
I hereby fully support you to undertake such endeavour. At any time when you believe that it is appropriate and adequate, I will really do as much as I can in order to contribute to achieving the necessary change.
It is most important to demonstrate willingness. It is necessary to make pressure because, without it, many will not make any change upon their own initiative. I really encourage you hereby to exercise such pressure because it is your right to do so. It is the only possible way in which you can draw attention to yourselves, to your existence. That is how you will affect these persons, who spend their days, hours, weeks, months discussing the issues that ultimately remain unresolved, spend not even one tenth, but at least one thirtieth part of their time to try to understand and start solving problems of the persons who fall into the category of marginalized groups in BiH.
There is no one else to do this but you. Of course, we can and must help. That is our responsibility. But, creating a general environment, exercising some public pressure, opening issues, breaking taboos, removing prejudices - that must, dominantly, come from your own surroundings.
Therefore, once again, I extend my thanks to the organizers and to all of you for making this happen. I am certain that the Coalition, will keep gaining more and more significance over time, that, if it will prevail by remaining persistent, and accumulate a serious power necessary to change things in the right way - both in politics, but also in creating an adequate general social environment. Politics cannot do this on its own. The society can do it, the media can do it, too, and the intellectual circles can do it indeed. All these together can create such surroundings which will enable an individual, who belongs to the group, to be as happy as possible, live as normally as possible, and not to be treated as a problem but as an integral part of the society.
Thank you for your attention!"
74079,Address by the Croat Member of BiH Presidency on the occasion of 2016 Christmas reception,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=74079&langTag=en-US,2016-12-20,"My joy tonight would be complete if we could know that all of our countrymen, and all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, can celebrate the upcoming holidays in the warmth of their homes, relieved of temptations and uncertainties of life.
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen,
Your Excellences,
Your Eminence,
Dear friends,
please allow me to welcome you this evening, as the host, on behalf of the great family of the representatives of the executive, legislative and political authorities of the Croat people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I want to share with you a sense of joy, happiness and togetherness, as we have traditionally gathered during this time leading to Christmas.
Christmas enriches us, gives us strength, brings joy to our lives and restores faith in a better and brighter tomorrow.
Christmas fills our hearts with the blessings of love and peace, and inexhaustible desire to build a society of prosperity and love among people.
My joy tonight would be complete if we could know that all of our countrymen, and all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, can celebrate the upcoming holidays in the warmth of their homes, relieved of temptations and uncertainties of life.
Let us, please, send our thoughts from the comfort of this Christmas gathering of ours, for at least a moment, to those exposed to the horrors of war throughout the world.
Let us also hope that the good Lord will send through our positive thoughts encouragement to all those who make decisions and can stop conflicts, to stop the suffering of innocent people, especially children.
Perhaps none of us gathered here can make global decisions or significantly influence those, but each of us can give at least a small contribution towards the prosperity of our homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear God gave us this beautiful country to nurture as our inheritance, and it is up to us to run it in a way that will make it a pride of all three of its constituent peoples and each of its inhabitants.
During the last year’s Christmas celebration we clearly indicated the need to accelerate the Euro-Atlantic processes.
Despite the multitude of disbeliefs, today we can proudly say that we are successfully implementing these processes. That has not been an easy job. But it is possible.
I would like to thank all of you who believed in us, who helped us submit, despite the doubts of many, a credible application for the EU membership. That was recognized ten days ago when Commissioner Hahn handed us the Questionnaire for Bosnia and Herzegovina, marking yet another significant step forward made by this country. We certainly will not stop there.
In the year ahead, and on this path, we can not be stopped by any doubts about the functioning of the EU and the issues recognized regarding the concept of its expansion.
We all have a lot of work to do. We have to agree on the legislative infrastructure, to implement the decision of the Strasbourg Court and the ruling of the Constitutional Court.
Ultimately, at the beginning of next year, all that should be built into the electoral law regarding the election of the members of the Presidency, selection and the manner of decision-making at the House of Peoples, as well as the functioning of the City of Mostar.
The sense of constitutional and institutional equality must be complete and it should be the foundation of the modern and European Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Following the submission of the answers to the already received questionnaire, I am sure that by the end of 2017 we will get the status of an EU candidate country and activate the NATO membership action plan.
I believe that we have the political wisdom to recognize the need to seek strategic partnerships with our neighbors to the east and west.
In the New Year, at the internal level, our primary task should be the strengthening of the economic stability of the whole country and each of its parts, as well as the need for increased social sensitivity in all structures of society.
In order to succeed in all of this, dear friends, we should strongly focus on our collectiveness.
Let us be inspired by this festive time, let us find the strength and motivation to look forward together, while building peace and love among all people.
Be illuminated by the light of the birth of Jesus Christ and let it enlighten you with the truth and warmth to share with your loved ones."
73685,"Address by Dr Dragan Čović, the Croat member of BiH Presidency at the reception marking the occasion of the Statehood Day of BiH, Sarajevo, 24 November 2016",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=73685&langTag=en-US,2016-11-24,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, dear friends! With cordial, friendly greetings, let me extend my welcome to you to the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We gathered today in order to show our adherence to our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina, and remember the values woven into the foundations of her statehood – a historic commitment and decision made by all peoples of BiH that their country should be a state union of equal peoples and citizens. Such commitment was shown in a special way 73 years ago, when it was firmly built into our constitutional tradition. Then, in an identical way, it was transfused into the referendum question of March 1992, and included into the Dayton Constitution of BiH subsequently.
The statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been inseparably connected to her multinational character and plurality of her society. That is the true spirit of our country, the spirit which has permeated her throughout history and entrusted her, in entirely equal way, to all her peoples - the Serbs, the Croats and the Bosniaks respectively. Diverging from that vision, misunderstanding it and dreaming on establishment of a monolith society either in the whole territory of BiH or in just one of her parts, has been the greatest threat to her statehood, the statehood which we are solemnly marking today in a special way.
Despite of such tendencies, one should not have a slightest doubt that the constitutiveness and equality of peoples and equality of all citizens will remain the main determinant and direction after all future changes of the Constitution of BiH are completed. Such changes will have to harmonize, continue to affirm and implement the equality and equal rights for all. Sooner or later, the constitutiveness has to reach each citizen of ours because to be constitutive means to be satisfied, have equal rights, be equal and feel this country truly as one's own. This is a precondition of dignity for each person in BiH, both as an individual and as a member of any of her peoples. Finally, this is our constitutional and patriotic obligation, too. Due to all this, any hesitation in view of our fundamental constitutional values is, at the same time, the hesitation in view of Bah.
Those values which connect us, expressed nowadays in the form of principles of constitutiveness and equality, oblige us to keep contemplating on a far better and fairer Bosnia and Herzegovina than she is today, on a country in which all her peoples will have equal rights in institutional and political, social, religious, language, media, economic and any other sense. Therefore it is of extreme importance in these challenging times of ours to rely on the fundamental principles that are the foundation of statehood, as well as a kind of signpost marking a democratic construction of BiH. I am deeply convinced that it is within such frameworks that we have to look for inspiration for a vision of our homeland organized to suit all three peoples, as well as all those who are outside that identification framework.
Do all of us firmly believe in it at the moment? Honestly, I am not sure. It is certain that BiH is at a junction. It is no secret that today there are many who have doubted the European project. Such doubts and scepticism can only be conquered by a belief in the European future and a dedicated work aimed at achieving it. The reason for a true concern is that there are political calculations and insufficient honesty of many who are called to declare themselves on this destiny-shaping project. I fear and feel that not all of us are fully committed in our minds and hearts to fighting for and winning the European future of BiH. A doze of internal resistance is palpable, and that is a particular challenge facing all of us. Indeed, the only way to fight against it is through togetherness, which can only be achieved by building mutual trust, based on credible political actions. Due to all this, we have to find a way to unite ourselves around the shared constitutional values and organizational principles, and carry out a dedicated work in order to affirm them at all levels and within all structures.
It is entirely clear that many issues have not been resolved fully and consistently in our homeland, certainly not in a way that would ensure that all can feel equally good here. I believe that it should not be too demanding to regulate by law marking of the state and religious holidays. I believe that it is not a problem to regulate the election law to suit the needs of all peoples of BiH in order to introduce more symmetry, and more equal rights for all through that symmetry.
The EU accession process, which we have initiated, is an opportunity we have to make use of in order to achieve internal harmonization and meet our objectives. It is by regulating constitutional and legal frameworks that we eliminate disputed issues and enhance a democratic environment. At the same time, we have to fully commit ourselves to building a society of economic, social, political stability and comfortable standard of living. Attitudes to all these issues, derived from the imperative of constitutiveness, will show very shortly where each of us stands individually in relation to the values which have gathered us today, and to which extent we really are honest in everything we pledge for.
I extend my invitation to you hereafter that we build together, through a different, more responsible approach to mutual dialogue and understanding, a more positive environment in our Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I wish you all best. Cheers!"
73768,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of BiH Presidency to the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=73768&langTag=en-US,2016-11-08,"This morning I would like to talk about these three issues: 1) the vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina's future within the European Union; 2) the steps we have made in order to turn this vision into reality, and, when I say “we“, I refer to the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina together; 3) the threats and challenges we have been faced with, and how we can oppose them together.
Esteemed members of the European Parliament,
Mr Brok,
It is always my pleasure to be in Brussels – particularly in the European Parliament, where there are so many friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I extend my thanks to all of you for this opportunity to share views with you.
This morning I would like to talk about the following three issues:
1) The vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina's future within the European Union;
2) The steps we have made in order to turn this vision into reality, and, when I say “we“, I refer to the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina together;
3) The threats and challenges we have been faced with, and how we can oppose them together.
For a moment, let me bring you back to 6 February 2014, when the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted its annual Resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina. You set out in that Resolution your deep concern due to „a lack of shared vision on the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed by the political leaders“.
A day later, on 7 February 2014, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina gathered in the streets to protest against the hardship social and economic situation and request from us, their elected leaders, to offer a vision of the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to make concrete steps needed to turn that vision into reality.
Ten days later, Mr Štefan Füle, EU Enlargement Commissioner at the time, arrived to Sarajevo with a conclusion that there would be no agreement achieved by the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the implementation of the European Court for Human Rights' judgement concerning the case of Sejdić and Finci versus BiH. This did not happen because we had not been trying sufficiently. Namely, in the course of almost thirty months, we held more than 150 meetings, at which we discussed over 50 various suggestions. We did not manage to reach an agreement because some of the participants of these negotiations were expressing a mix of populism and alienation from the actual needs of our citizens. Therefore, it came as no surprise that Mr Füle stated, pursuant to our last meeting, that the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina “had to act more responsibly to address the citizens' needs“ – ensure more new jobs, more justice and better life standard.
In the weeks and months that followed the protests held in February, we held numerous meetings with various representatives of the academic community, civil society and businesspersons throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. When friends from the EU capitals or Brussels visited us in Sarajevo and asked how they could help and what kind of assistance they could provide us with in order to ensure that we start moving forward, we told them what we understood through those meetings and encounters – that it was in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all her citizens that we should focus on the two issues: social and economic reforms and convergence in the European Union.
The idea was simple: that we dedicate ourselves to the actual needs of our citizens through the implementation of difficult social and economic reforms, while hoping that, pursuant to progress that we would achieve due to such reforms, it would also be easier to achieve agreements on the issues such as the implementation of the Sejdić – Finci judgement. Our friends from Croatia, Slovenia and other EU countries helped us present this argument throughout the EU. In November 2014 Germany and Great Britain officially proposed to other EU members the so-called “renewed EU approach“. In December 2014 their proposal was supported by all 28 member states, and it became the official EU policy then.
And, what has happened since then?
In short, Bosnia and Herzegovina returned to the EU accession path, and achieved more progress on that path in the previous 18 months than in the entire previous decade. The renewed EU approach enabled us to achieve such progress. We did the job ourselves in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the EU provided us with its invaluable support.
Mr Ivanić and Mr Čović, my colleagues in the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Id I initiated progress along that path by preparing the “Declaration on commitment to reforms within the EU accession framework“. It was not an easy task to gather the leaders of all 14 parliamentary political parties in order to ensure their agreement on the content of the declaration concerned. Our good friend Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative, who was with us in Sarajevo on the day when this declaration was adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, referred to that adoption as “a historic step in the right direction“.
The three of us in the Presidency agreed that it was our task to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina would keep moving forward in the set direction. The Chairperson of the Council of Ministers and the two entity prime ministers conducted very intense negotiations for months on the content of the social and economic reform agenda for the period from 2015 to 2018. Taking into consideration the lessons learnt from the previous experience, particularly concerning the need to enhance functioning of the labour market and the structure of the budget expenditures, we agreed on a comprehensive Reform Agenda, which promised most significant redirection of our economics since the time of the Dayton Peace Accords – from enhancement of the business climate to the reform of labour legislation, from the health care system reform to the implementation of a comprehensive pension system reform and more efficient collection of taxes. The content of the Reform Agenda was drafted in close cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the EBRD. These institutions have provided their financial support to the implementation of the Reform Agenda. The European Commission has established that significant results have been achieved already due to the implementation of the Reform Agenda.
One such result was a significant increase of economic activity. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most rapidly growing economy in our region at the moment. The GDP increase of in 2015 was 3.14%, which was twice as much in relation to 2014. We expect the GDP growth rate to remain at 3% this year, with a possible rise to 4% in the mid-term period. The revenue from indirect taxes has grown by 3%. The industrial production has increased by 2.2%. The unemployment rate has fallen by 4.4% in relation to the previous year.
We have also made significant steps towards convergence in the EU. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement came into effect in summer 2015. In February 2016 Mr Dragan Čović, my colleague filed our application for membership in the EU. In September 2016 the EU member countries accepted our membership application as a credible one. We are delighted that we will host Commissioner Hahn in Sarajevo on 9 December, when he will hand over the European Commission's questionnaire, which will assess our readiness for obtaining the candidate status. Let me assure you that completing the questionnaire will be the priority for all administrative levels in BiH because we want to receive an opinion from the European Commission as soon as possible on our readiness for the candidate status. That opinion will help us realize to which extent our institutions, legislation and practice deviate from the EU standards. Businesspersons and civil society representatives keep telling us that they see achieving the EU standards as a priority. Our citizens want to buy quality goods and services in accordance with the EU quality standards. Business companies and investors want to see legal security and the EU standards applied in BiH because that will enable them to do business with the EU in an easier and more simple way.
Dear friends,
I am not here to show you a pink image of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina, or to assert that a bright future is granted. We have been faced with many challenges and we have had many open issues. The political relations are still very fragile. The level of trust is not satisfactory yet. Instances of turbulence occur almost daily. To achieve the current progress has not been easy at all, and the path ahead will bring about even more challenges. Therefore, I believe that we should proceed along this path cautiously, while making sure that we do not jeopardize what has been achieved so far.
I believe that most of you will agree that mobilizing such political forces which will resist the growing populism, as well as winning our citizens' sympathy and support for such resistance, have never been more difficult than now. Support provided by some third countries to populists throughout the EU countries, as well as throughout the countries striving to join the EU, has been much stronger nowadays than it used to be a few years ago. They are not interested in any facts or in the long-term impact their actions will have to our societies.
In the EU member states these forces have been directed against the EU and our shared values. In Bosnia and Herzegovina they have been directed against the constitutional order, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as against our goal to reach the destination preferred by 80% of our citizens – i.e. the family of Euro-Atlantic states. In the RS entity such actors conducted a referendum by which the Decision of the Constitutional Court was flagrantly breached, the constitutional order was challenged, the Dayton Peace Accords was breached, and a serious threat to security and stability of BiH was posed. We have been faced with the populist forces which have obstructed adoption of the social and economic reforms. While playing the card of ethnic differences, some of these populists have also raised inter-ethnic tensions by making unfounded statements on their endangered vital national interests. They want to return us to the counter-productive and polarizing debates on constitutional reforms. We should not let them prevail!
The struggle against these growing forces can only be won if we oppose them together. Therefore, I firmly support the decision of the EU member states to accept our application for membership. We also appreciate all the assistance which we have received from the EU institutions and individual EU member states in order to enable us to meet the conditions we were given. Such support is very important because it sends a strong message to those political actors who have received support from the third countries to work against our shared future in the EU and NATO.
Dear members of the European Parliament,
In view of Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the EU, I want to share with you what I believe is realistic for us to achieve in the next 12 to 18 months.
First, we will complete the European Commission's questionnaire.
Second, we will intensify the implementation of the Reform Agenda.
Third, through the Coordination Mechanism adopted this summer, all administrative levels in our state will agree and adopt the state-level strategies in the fields of transport, energy and agriculture – in order to enable us to, finally, start using the pre-accession EU funds.
Fourth, as soon as the European Commission prepares its opinion on our readiness, we will work in accordance with that opinion towards achieving the candidate status. Our goal is to achieve the candidate status by the end of 2017.
And fifth, there is a possibility that we will reach an agreement on the implementation of the Sejdić-Finci case. That agreement could also take into account some legitimate remarks made by the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Croats. However, let me be honest with you. I fear that, despite urgency, it will be very difficult to agree on these issues because it is necessary to win a two-third majority in both houses of the State Parliament, gathering the representatives of 14 different political parties.
It would be of huge assistance to us if the implementation of the judgment on Sejdić-Finci case is not posed as a firm condition to our accession to the EU. I invite all in the EU to cautiously proceed, while thinking strategically which particular approach would bring about best results for all of us. It is my suggestion that all constitutional issues should be considered within the framework of opening chapters on negotiations for our EU membership. Wider constitutional reforms, which fall out of the framework of the Sejdić-Finci judgement implementation, are neither desirable nor doable at this moment because the key political actors in BiH would simply not be able to reach an agreement on their scope and content. In the next two years we will have to focus on the social and economic reforms, building of transport infrastructure, public administration reform and strengthening of the rule of law. These are the issues that the citizens need addressed, and that is what they expect from us.
Dear friends,
I would now like to talk about the contribution of Bosnia and Herzegovina to promoting our shared values, vision and objectives in the domain of foreign and security policy. This morning you shared views with High Representative Mogherini on the implementation of the Global EU Strategy. Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully committed to the principles and priorities set out in the Strategy, and will contribute to its implementation to the extent in which she can do so as a potential candidate state. We will accept our part of responsibility for facing security threats and challenges that Europe is facing nowadays.
We have been committed to the fight against terrorism in all its forms. As a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, we will continue to contribute, within our capabilities, to the international efforts invested in degrading and defeating this terrorist organization. We are the first country in the region which adopted the amendments to our Criminal Code in order to establish legal sanctions against fighters who fight wars abroad. Our legislation has been additionally strengthened in its segments concerning the prohibition against the financing of terrorist activities.
Terrorism is a threat which has affected all of us. No single country or society has been immune to that threat, and no single country can oppose it on its own. Terrorism has become a growing challenge which requires a comprehensive reply based on cooperation of all states not only through security measures, but through preventive measures, too.
Those who conduct, organize or encourage terrorist attacks, while claiming that they do it in the name of Islam, act absolutely contrary to the values of Islam and its universal principles of tolerance and coexistence. Violent extremism and terrorism are entirely unacceptable from the point of view of Islam. Terrorism in the name of Islam is terrorism against Islam.
Stability and security of the Western Balkans, and its ultimate consolidation within the EU framework are of Bosnia and Herzegovina's top strategic importance. We will continue to cooperate closely with the EU and the countries in the region in view of achieving these shared objectives. To that end, we very much appreciate and commit ourselves to regional dialogue and cooperation. We will continue to participate actively in all frameworks and mechanisms of regional cooperation with the EU, particularly through the Berlin Process. The instance of regional cooperation on projects of infrastructural connectedness builds trust, improves relations, and offers palpable economic benefit to our citizens.
However, political leaders in the region, from time to time, continue to use such rhetoric or activities which raise tensions and cause regional instability – very often due to mutual misunderstanding and a lack of trust. We witnessed it during the migration crisis, and during the elections held in the region recently.
I am convinced that what is needed, and still missing for the time being, is a high-level political dialogue between the EU and the Western Balkans, which would enhance stability and security in the region, and ensure its ultimate consolidation within the EU frameworks. Certainly, the political leaders in the region bear primary responsibility for building stable and safe environment which is conductive for general progress. However, the EU itself has a role to play in this process. Carefully defined and well structured political dialogue at a high level between the EU and the Western Balkans countries would create a much needed platform and mechanism through which the EU could provide its assistance and support to our region in achieving the following two shared objectives:
- Stabilize the political environment by mitigating crises and lowering tensions at their initial stages, and resolving disputes and remaining open issues in accordance with the international and EU standards;
- Develop both comprehensive and coordinated approaches through which the EU and the Western Balkans would react to security threats affecting the region and the EU, such as the migration crisis, organized crime, terrorism and radicalisation, with an ultimate goal of developing security networks and interoperability within the region, as well as building such networks between the region and the EU.
To conclude, let me assure you that we in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain fully committed to supporting a positive momentum and continuing implementation of the reform agenda within our EU accession process. The future of BiH lies firmly in the EU. We are convinced that a full integration into the EU is best course, leading to achieving stability, security and progress in our country. The accession process itself is most efficient mechanism for transformation of our country, aimed at achieving the contemporary democratic standards and enhancing our economic growth. No matter how many challenges there will be on that path, and no matter how many obstacles we will encounter, we will keep moving forward. For us, there is no alternative to that.
Thank you for your attention, and I remain available for your questions."
72843,"Statement by H.E. Mr. Bakir Izetbegović,Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the General Debate of the 71St Session of the United Nations General Assembly",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=72843&langTag=en-US,2016-09-21,"We are facing the worst forced-displacement crisis since the Second World War. Sixty million people have been forced to flee their homes because of wars, persecution, and human rights violations. They are scattered around the world, their livelihoods and communities shattered into pieces, their nations and cultures torn apart. Robbed of their dignity, living in despair in refugee camps, they are compelled to seek a better future on the borders of other countries. They are not faceless statistics, but human beings with every right to a future free of violence, a future of hope and opportunity. Their tragedy is our tragedy. Their future is our future.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Peace and security, human rights and development are the pillars of the United Nations -- a founding promise to the world this Organization was created to safeguard. Yet, our world today is anything but peaceful and secure. It is marred with injustice, inequality and intolerance that erode the foundations of our humanity. We are witnessing human suffering of an unprecedented scale, reaching far beyond national boundaries or capacities. Poverty, hunger, disease, natural disasters and climate change afflict millions of our fellow human beings. Many states and societies are trapped in protracted conflicts, with cycles of violence claiming countless victims.
We are facing the worst forced-displacement crisis since the Second World War. Sixty million people have been forced to flee their homes because of wars, persecution, and human rights violations. They are scattered around the world, their livelihoods and communities shattered into pieces, their nations and cultures torn apart. Robbed of their dignity, living in despair in refugee camps, they are compelled to seek a better future on the borders of other countries. They are not faceless statistics, but human beings with every right to a future free of violence, a future of hope and opportunity. Their tragedy is our tragedy. Their future is our future.
This crisis requires not only a humanitarian response, but a sustainable political solution. It requires stronger political leadership and resolve, as well as rethinking of policy, operational and financing strategies at national, regional and international levels. But all too often nanow national interests impede the formulation of such joint responses. When crises transcend borders, like the current refugee and migrant crisis in the Middle East and in Europe, we must look broadly, not merely from the standpoint of national interests, because the consequences of our actions and omissions resonate beyond our borders.
As a country whose hundreds of thousands of citizens experienced the plight of being forced out of their homes, Bosnia and Herzegovina attaches a great significance to addressing this challenge. We recognize the importance and timely organization of the High-level meeting on large movement on refugees and migrants, and we welcome the adoption of the Outcome document that is clearly linked to the Agenda 2030. We hope the commitments Member States made in this meeting will have meaningful impact on the ground. In the Agenda 2030 we pledged that ""no one will be left behind"", and committed to empower the most vulnerable. For the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons that means the ability to return to their homes, to be better integrated into their host societies, or to be settled elsewhere if needed. It means the difference between a life of aid dependency and the opportunity for a life of dignity and self-reliance.
Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the Agenda 2030. As a newly elected member of the Economic and Social Council, we will play an active role in the implementation of this transformative blueprint for change. Our achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals will depend on the availability of support for national implementation -- primarily from the revised and improved Global partnership for sustainable development, which must be a true global platform for exchange of best practices in the field of finance, trade, technology and capacity building between Member States. We support the Global mechanism and the monitoring of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, which will outline critical milestones towards a coherent and inclusive follow up and review of the Agenda at the global level.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Terrorism is a global threat that affects us all. No state or society is imrnune from it, and no state alone can counter it. With violent extremism on the rise, and a growing number of foreign terrorist fighters, terrorism is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge that requires a comprehensive response involving the collaboration of all States, employing not only security, but preventive measures as well. We face a problem that has deep and complex roots, that transcends national boundaries, and that cannot, and should not, be associated with any one religion, nationality or ethnic group.
Those who perpetrate, organize, and inspire terrorist attacks -- claiming to do so in the name of Islam -- want to turn Islam into an ideology of global fear. Violent extremism and terrorism are unacceptable from the viewpoint of any religion, including Islam. They undermine its system of values and its universal teachings of tolerance and coexistence.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is strongly committed to combating terrorism in all its forms. We are deeply concerned with the rise of violent extremism, and attach a great importance to countering it. We welcome the Secretary General' s initiative and Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, as another useful tool in a comprehensive, whole-of-UN approach to preventing violent extremism.
Prevention of extremism and promotion of human rights cannot be separated. Inclusive governance and respect for the rule of law are of paramount importance. Political, economic and social injustices around the world contribute to the rise of despair and hopelessness, creating a fertile ground for the emergence of radicalism and violent extremism. There is ever more injustice in the imperfect world we live in, but actions causing even greater injustice are not the right response. Our governments must and will respond to violence with force and repressive measures. However, if that part of our response is not can-ied out precisely and selectively, with respect for human rights and the rule of law, it will only cause a new wave of radicalization. The real fight and ultimate victory must and can only be on the ideological level.
Our approach and strategy must be holistic. We must apply a wide range of policies and measures that address the economic and social conditions conducive to the spread of violent extremism, which terrorist organizations exploit to drive recruitment and radicalization. In particular, we must work harder to eliminate discrimination, prejudice and xenophobia in our societies, reduce poverty and inequality, improve education and expand opportunities, especially for our young generations.
Mr. President,
Engagement of the United Nations has never been more critical, as we face unprecedented challenges in confronting the surge in violence of various forms around the world. Global action, guided by the principles of international law, is required to put an end to the violence and instability in UM-aine, Syria, haq, Libya and other crisis areas. Ensuring protection of civilians and compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law is imperative. Neutrality and indifference lead to resentment and frustration, further emboldening those who leave devastation and sorrow in their wake.
Humanitarian aid can never serve as a substitute for solutions that address the root causes of conflict. Nor can it create the necessary conditions for lasting peace and stability. The main causes of modern conflicts are discrimination and exclusion, failures of governance, impunity, deep-rooted poverty and lack of opportunities, aggravated by the growing effects of climate change. In our increasingly interconnected world, we can no longer keep the impact of far-away conflicts outside our borders, nor can we ignore their global consequences.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Over the past year we saw a renewed sense of unity and unprecedented levels of commitments. We agreed to the Sendai Framework, the Addis Ababa Action Plan, the Agenda 2030, the Agenda for Humanity and the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We collectively committed to humanity, with renewed focus on conflict prevention and resolution, strengthened efforts towards sustainable development, equal opportunities for all, promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.
Peace and security cannot be detached from either development or environmental agendas. Peace is not merely absence of violence. It is a freedom from fear and insecurity. There is no lasting peace and security when injustice and inequality are an everyday experience for millions of people, when basic rights and freedoms are denied to so many human beings. The resulting grievances make our states unstable and our societies vulnerable, and readily fuel extremism, radicalization and violence. Injustice and inequality diminish the human potential of our communities, leaving development and prosperity beyond their reach.
The road of progress goes from ending poverty to reducing inequality and building just, equitable, tolerant, open and inclusive societies, with respect for human rights and promotion of the rule of law at the core of our every action. History will judge us by the difference we make in the lives of millions of people who are suffering from marginalization, discrimination, poverty, malnutrition, disease, natural disasters and climate change. We must listen to their voices and respond to their needs, hopes and aspirations. We must find the will and courage to take urgent action to turn the agendas we agreed upon into instruments of true global change, honoring our pledge to humanity and leaving a legacy true to our values.
Thank you!"
72902,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency of BiH on the occasion of construction works at Hydroelectric Power Plant (HE) Vranduk launch",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=72902&langTag=en-US,2016-09-08,"We live in the times of great challenges. However, much has been accomplished in the course of the last several years. Out of issues that should be pointed out, I would mention hereafter the start of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on the European path and a continued economic growth, as well as the launch of significant projects in the areas of infrastructure and energy industry.
Dear Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Prime Minister of the Federation of BiH, dear ministers, heads of canton and municipal authorities, esteemed investors, creditors, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen!
It was on the pages of the reputable British journal ”The Economist” that I recently read that actual improvement of issues was a result of a vision-driven acting. It seems to me that all of us here, who are dedicated to Bosnia and Herzegovina, should contribute to turning vision into action. Bosnia and Herzegovina does have its vision: membership in the European Union, and reliance on a new model of economic growth through exports, increased productivity, job generation, labour market-driven enhancement skills, energy efficiency, social inclusion and poverty alleviation.
We live in the times of great challenges. However, much has been accomplished in the course of the last several years. Out of issues that should be pointed out, I would mention hereafter the start of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on the European path, and a continued economic growth, as well as the launch of significant projects in the areas of infrastructure and energy industry. Within the Reform Agenda we launched efficient projects on protection of the poorest and on mitigating erosion of human capital.
Furthermore, it cannot go unnoticed that Bosnia and Herzegovina has played a responsible, constructive and active role in the international community, as well as in the region.
In short, in the last several years, we have moved Bosnia and Herzegovina in the right direction.
The launch of the construction works at Hydroelectric Power Plant Vranduk is yet another indicator of stability and a strong economic momentum in our country.
This project is an impressive one. Its investor – the Public Enterprise “Elektroprivreda BiH”, the creditors – the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but all of us as well, can be proud of it.
This is one in a series of megaprojects, whose implementation will start in the course of the current and next year, when Bosnia and Herzegovina will become a huge construction site.
Ladies and gentlemen,
If we know that the hydro energetic potential of Bosnia and Herzegovina is four times larger than the one we have used so far, if utilization of the hydro potential in our country is lowest in Europe, than the conclusion is obvious indeed. The fast rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina are our huge, but still untapped, strategic development opportunity.
Of course, in development strategies and plans, no one will take such risk as to jeopardize the environment and residents in the valleys of our rivers. Environmental standards must be our top priorities.
Finally, it is my wish that we send a clear message from here on the positive environment and potential of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as a message to investors that our country is ready for enhanced development, and that it is a safe place for placement of investment and money.
I hereby extend my congratulations to both the investor and implementers for the launch of construction works at the Hydroelectric Power Plant Vranduk, with wishes for prompt and safe implementation, and for a successful exploitation of the future plant.
Thank you!"
72007,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, Chairperson of BiH Presidency at the commemoration on the occasion of marking the 21st anniversary of the genocide committed against the “Safe UN Srebrenica Area“ Bosniak",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=72007&langTag=en-US,2016-07-11,"Dear Srebrenica mothers, family members of innocent people from Srebrenica who were killed, esteemed mayor Duraković, dear members of the Organising Board, dear guests, your excellences, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen!
I hereby express my gratitude to the Organising Board, which ensured today's commemoration to take place. I commend their commitment in pursuing truth and preserving the fundamental values of humanity, often under circumstances of open intolerance shown in view of their work. I extend my deepest gratitude to those who were stricken most by the genocide committed in Srebrenica. Nothing would have been achieved without their courage.
It is difficult at this place of such tremendous pain and suffering to find proper words to express what I have felt since the time when I first walked among these white gravestones in Srebrenica. What can be said to mothers, wives and children of those who, by their own lives, bailed out both this place and the state we have today? Pain, sorrow, and suffering of those who outlived their dearest ones, who are buried at this place, are of such nature that it would be best just to remain silent. The only voice worthy of their peace is a voice of prayer, of a sincere dua placed before their souls.
Let us also pray today for the boy called Avdija, who was fourteen, and for the old man called Mustafa, who was seventy seven. They were killed because of their names, their religion and their people to whom they were born into. Thousands of those like them lie here side by side. We are still trying to find at least one more thousand of them.
Namely, the remains of those killed were hidden in ditches, dug into the ground by excavators, scattered across the hills and forests with the intention of completing the crime and leaving no trace of the victims.
Twenty one years after the appalling aggression against BiH, validated by the genocide committed in Srebrenica, I am determined, more than ever before, to seek justice and truth for each killed person from Srebrenica.
Are we on a path towards achieving such justice? Are we on a path towards achieving justice for both the victims and their families in Bosnia and Herzegovina? We must achieve justice because, unless we do so, there will neither be reconciliation nor necessary prerequisites for forgiveness and rebuilding of trust. The souls will find rest, and the victims' eye lids will only close together when justice is achieved, or they will not close ever.
It will be only then when we, without any hesitation, put things in their right places, when we remove a slightest doubt on who stood on the right and who stood on the wrong side of history, that we will free ourselves from divisions and burden of the past. This is our debt to all to whom we are paying respects today, to each killed person, but also to the overall community struggling against fascism anywhere in the world. Finally, it is our debt to next generations. Both the past and the present need truth. However, it is the future that needs truth most.
In order to remain in the past forever, a crime must be matched with its punishment, whereas victims must be granted justice and satisfaction. It is justified to ask ourselves whether we in this region are bliss for the future or a curse from the past to one another.
The answer to this question lays in our readiness to draw lessons from history and turn them into a vision of peace-making, understanding and tolerance.
We have learnt a painful lesson, and it is our duty to share a warning driven from it – that a dream focused on destroying others always ends in self-destruction and defeat of its dreamer.
The policies which in the late 20th century saw a solution in divisions and separatism, force and violence, exclusion of others, in spreading fear and injustice, the policies which, ultimately, led to Vukovar and Srebrenica, must, once and for all, be abandoned.
Dear friends, brothers and sisters!
Today we remember the horrors of the past, but we take an oath that the past will not paralyse us. Today's commemoration at which we gathered is about the future – the future of our children and of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All of us lived through some tragedies. However, despite of devastating pain, it is our obligation to those who survived, to continue to make this country a better place.
No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People, unfortunately, learn to hate. Therefore, may those who negate the genocide in Srebrenica or remain silent think deep about it and reconcile themselves with darkest stain in their history. They must know one thing – accepting and recognizing truth is a first step to true reconciliation.
That is where any thought on coexistence lays and starts. Regardless of how unpleasant it may be, ultimately, the only thing which will be remembered the truth. It is indeed nothing but the truth, when uttered and accepted, which can liberate the future from horrible mortgage carried over from the genocidal past.
Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen!
What happened in the past cannot be changed. It can only be remembered, and it will be remembered indeed. However, we can change the future – the future of this country and the next generations to whom all of us owe accountability, peace, as well as a vision of prosperity.
Evil cannot be deleted, but we can defeat it by goodness. We owe such victory to those who lie here. It is our obligation to preserve memories, defend the truth, strengthen and build a community from which they were streamed away because it is only by doing so that we will preserve their lives and sacrifice from oblivion. This Potočari field full of gravestones, and the new rows of tabuts in it, remind us of sorrow and pain. However, they are also a plight for the ones who are alive, a testimony of the struggle which we ought to continue and complete.
Therefore, we will not become exhausted, and we will not allow lies, injustice and evil to prevail. The ways in which we will oppose lies, injustice and evil are by building unity instead of divisions, spreading love instead of hatred, and choosing life instead of death. We will guard truth and seek justice in the name of the past which we cannot change and the future which we must build."
71997,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, Chairperson of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the NATO Summit (the meeting on Afghanistan) on 9 July 2016 in Warsaw",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=71997&langTag=en-US,2016-07-09,"Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully aware of complexity of the strategic context of Afghanistan, which is characterized by prompt changes, uncertainty and surprise, and strong impact they have on internal processes and their respective dynamism in Afghanistan.
While recognizing the characteristics of this context, Bosnia and Herzegovina has fully supported the instruments NATO has used throughout its ongoing mission aimed at achieving stability and prosperity in Afghanistan. We are ready to provide a military contribution to NATO efforts in order to train, advice and support development of the state security forces of Afghanistan by the time they will take over a full responsibility for the security of Afghanistan. We are ready to offer such support as long as there is a need for military resources and competencies which Bosnia and Herzegovina can place under the Alliance's disposal.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has supported the concept of the “Decisive Support“ Mission for Afghanistan. We understand that the moment of transition from the first to the second mission phase will be determined based on the status of the security situation on the ground and the level of readiness of the Afghan security forces to take over a full responsibility for their country's security. Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined, should there be a need for it, to offer NATO the same military contribution in the second phase, too, regardless of the envisaged structural reduction of the mission.
In addition to our contribution in terms of military resources, Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to support the mission in Afghanistan by a symbolic participation proportionate to her capacity in numerous aspects of an ongoing comprehensive restoration of Afghanistan. In cooperation with allies and partners, we will also support financially the process of enhancing sustainability of the Afghan state security forces. We are determined to ensure a new donation of military equipment and ammunition for the Afghan state security service, in accordance with the Decision adopted by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as offer cooperation on issues of special interest for Afghanistan.
Bosnia and Herzegovina reaffirms her interest to participate in planning and establishing a new, civilian mission in Afghanistan, after the “Decisive Support“ mission is completed.
On the basis of the information collected on the content and features of a long term partnership with Afghanistan, the needs of the future mission and economic potentials of our country, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina will adopt necessary decisions in view of using resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina in development of a stable and prosperous Afghanistan.
Ladies and gentlemen!
This is also an opportunity for me to share with you a survey on preconditions which Bosnia and Herzegovina has to meet for MAP to be activated.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is decisive in her intention to continue the process of registering perspective military locations into land books. The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina obliges itself to complete, pursuant to the activation of MAP for BiH, the registration of all remaining perspective military locations within ANP.
We have achieved a considerable progress in view of “Defence Review“. Based on the major work carried out by the Ministry of Defence of BiH and the Armed Forces of BiH, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina recently resolved all doubts and open issues within the documents concerned, and we now expect it to be completed successfully by end-November this year. The HQ of NATO in Sarajevo had an active role in creating this document.
Moreover, Bosnia and Herzegovina has had an active role in fighting all forms of radical extremism, whereas, within its capacities, BiH has supported the global coalition opposing the so-called ISIS. Last year we donated 600 tons of ammunition to the Government of Iraq. Last month, the Presidency of BiH approved of another donation amounting to the same quantity of ammunition for the Iraq Army.
We are grateful to the U.S. Government for the assistance in preparation of these donations.
From the moment of transformation from a beneficiary to provider of security, we have decided to make further steps towards enhancing regional and global security, as well as steps directed at enhancing our partnership with NATO, which, ultimately, leads to our full membership in the Alliance.
Bosnia and Herzegovina extends congratulations to Montenegro for joining NATO. We see the membership of Montenegro as an additional factor of stability and cooperation in the region."
71397,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegović at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the SEECP in Sofia,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=71397&langTag=en-US,2016-06-01,"Honorable Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my pleasure to address you today. As you are well aware, Balkans is the region where history often creates burden too heavy to bear. But what we can and want to do, is to develop close relations with our neighboring countries and beyond, based on mutual respect and mutual interests
Bosnia and Herzegovina is positioned within the region as one of its core countries, and we develop close partnerships with all the countries in the region. The future of this region is integration, in the best interest of all the countries involved.
Bosnia and Herzegovina truly appreciates the importance of the South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) in bringing together the countries from the Adriatic and Black Sea to the Ionian and the Mediterranean Sea, and resolving important issues for two decades. This process has proven its lasting value, from its origins in Sofia 1996. up to the recent activities led by Bulgarian Chairmanship-in-Office.
All this time we have joined our forces to create a better atmosphere, to coordinate important matters in mutual cooperation, to reach our common goals – stability and progress for our countries.
Bosnia and Herzegovina remains strongly determined to continue strengthening regional cooperation in all areas. Successful regional cooperation is essential for creating a stable and secure environment, which the key the condition for economic development. I can say with firm conviction that we have the capacity and will to join forces allowing the South East Europe to become the exemplary case of successful regional cooperation, infrastructural connectivity, and friendly relations.
Two days ago the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina hosted the Brdo-Brijuni Process Leaders’ Meeting in Sarajevo, with the participation of the President of Italy as a special guest. The Summit was an opportunity to use the dialogue at the highest level in order to give an additional impetus for strengthening the regional cooperation and the processes of EU integration.
We also see the regional cooperation as a solid preparation for our future activities within the EU. I wish to remind you that the ""Sarajevo Declaration"" adopted on 21 April 2004 emphasizes regional cooperation as a basis of the European Union policy in the region of the Southeast Europe.
The EU itself has been built on foundations of regional cooperation in strategic areas. We see the EU membership as a chance for lasting peace, stability, security and prosperity, for all of our citizens.
Europe as a continent, including our region as well, faces a number of challenges; violent extremism, radicalism, and terrorism, human rights violations – those are matters of concern for all of us. European security and stability is an issue we take seriously. The crisis and conflicts in some parts of Europe concern us all, and it is our sincere hope that these conflicts will be resolved timely and peacefully.
However, we also need to be aware that some of these challenges, such as the vast migration of refugees heading north and west through our countries is a challenge that puts to the test not only our political resolve to cooperate, but also our very humanity. Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been on the path of this human wave. But we have been close enough to perceive and understand the magnitude of these events.
Many people in our countries have had the experience of seeking refuge from violence away from home in the past. We should draw a lesson of humility from that fact. And we should do our best to coordinate our efforts in handling this crisis.
Ladies and gentlemen,
In the framework of South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP), our countries took political initiative to assume regional ownership in fostering peace, security, good neighborly cooperation and economic development. Our efforts have a core purpose to leave behind the past instability, conflicts and collective apathy, in order to become a partner to EU on equal footing.
The path to developing relations and fostering cooperation in the region is building trust, favoring economic ties, resolving conflicts by compromise, and developing joint projects in the strategic areas of development.
The region and its people need more trust, and it has to grow organically, at the grassroots level, in order to have a full and meaningful impact.
I firmly believe this process is irreversibly under way, but it takes time, and time waits for no man. Neither would it wait for our peninsula, rich and varied in culture, history, natural resources and human talent, but still prone to falling into stereotype of „Balkanization“.
Trust is the only lasting cure for „de-balkanizing“ the Balkans.
To build it, it is instrumental to communicate, as often and as sincerely as possible, both in bilateral and multilateral settings. SEECP is a major regional forum for political dialogue and we should live up to its purpose of ensuring the voice of the region is heard on all the matters of importance.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a clear and strong interest of joining a stable and prosperous European Union. Bosnia and Herzegovina has cultivated many forms of coexistence in diversity, such as multi-ethnic solidarity and understanding, for centuries of our turbulent history. The core values of European Union correspond to the rich heritage we draw from the positive aspects and periods of our past. In many ways, the model of living together that developed in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a precursor of modern EU.
Hence, the EU membership is a top priority in foreign policy, and a strategic goal of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We submitted the application for EU membership on 15th of February, in Brussels. Our objective is to become an EU candidate country by the end of 2017. We will work to fulfill the remaining conditions, in order for the EU Council to consider positively our application as soon as possible, and forward it to the European Commission. We are already making institutional preparations to provide the Commission with required answers, once we receive European Commission questionnaire. We are aiming at and looking forward to a positive Avis.
Finally, I wish to congratulate Bulgaria, as the chairing country of SEECP, for the one year term of chairmanship-in-office, and to express my wish for the future chairmanship of Croatia to be successful.
Thank you!"

Dear presidents of the entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Dear high officials of other religious communities,
Your excellences,
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am particularly glad that I can extend the salaam and greetings to all of you on this truly great day.
In histories of states and peoples rare are the events like today's one.
In the dark times when Ferhadija was demolished there were very few who believed that a day such as today would ever arrive.
However, those who had believed it would be possible, and made it possible by their good deeds, have achieved victory today.
Let us avail ourselves of this opportunity to remember all of them today, let us pay respect and extend our gratitude to them.
It is with particular piety that we remember Murat Badić from Cazin, who testified and confirmed his faith and commitment to this mosque with his own life.
Let this day be a permanent warning to those who demolished Ferhadija.
It was their goal to demolish and deny a multi-century context of co-existence and tolerance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They have not, and, with God's help, they never will achieve such goal.
The messages which we have sent today from the courtyard of the restored Ferhadija have historical importance and strength that future generations in particular will bear witness to.
Notably, those messages are powerful because we have sent them together with the representatives of the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have strongly supported the restoration of Ferhadija with various means.
By her monumentality and beauty Ferhadija bears witness to values which overarch time and space, while linking people of different cultures and beliefs in the same way in which good people of different religions and nations have been connected in the course of its restoration.
Let me extend my gratitude to all those who invested their material goods into this splendid building.
In particular, let me extend my gratitude to both the people and the Government of the Republic of Turkey, who have contributed over 4 million Convertible Marks to the restoration of Ferhadija.
Among hundreds of monuments of material culture, which have been restored by our friends from Turkey in the last decade throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, many are of extraordinary beauty and importance, and some are part of the UNESCO-protected world cultural heritage.
However, you will agree that Ferhadija is the most beautiful of them all!
In its full symbolism, the restoration of Ferhadija is a confirmation of the victory of life and hope, a confirmation of a strong conviction that we will continue to live together in these areas.
The restoration of Ferhadija is a symbol of durable return of Bosniaks to these areas.
Namely, God's houses are not only the places where people pray. They represent a confirmation of survival of people who pray within them, too.
We, as responsible persons, have an obligation to build such future which will be based on mutual respect and appreciation.
Let us do everything we possibly can in order to understand each other better. Let us not jeopardize each other in any way. Let us learn about each other with lots of good will, appreciation and sincerity instead.
Dear friends,
Our numerous our cultural and historic monuments were wiped off the face of the earth in the course of the last war.
What was demolished most often were the waqfs - endowments, an important part of the cultural treasure owned by all our citizens and a confirmation of the identity of Bosniaks, as nation-building people. Unfortunately, among such demolished monuments were all mosques of Banja Luka, too.
Instances of such demolition also occurred prior to the last war, but never before did it happen to such large extent, with such intent, and with such persistence.
While not losing sight of the truth about the past, let us be decisive in our intent to go forward, and to look towards the future.
Harmonious relations between the peoples of different religions and nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina have their roots in the distant past and represent the value the generations of our ancestors have been proud of. The sounds of church bells and ezzans have never disrupted one another in this country. Indeed, they have complemented one another instead.
Therefore, I hope that our neighbours Serbs will experience the restored Ferhadija as a reunion of people, dedicated to their religious and cultural tradition, who respect the identity of others and of those who are different.
I believe that, by accepting the restored Ferhadija, the citizens of Banja Luka, while being determined to build a prosperous future in this beautiful town on the Vrbas river, have sent a message that they welcome and accept the return of their expelled Bosniak neighbours, with whom they wish to build such future together.
May the opening of the restored Ferhadija serve as an incentive for us to restore and strengthen these values to the benefit of all citizens of our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I am certain that we are starting fresh now. After Ferhadija opens its doors to worshippers, let us continue to open doors to each other, assured that our differences do not jeopardize anyone nor do they limit anyone."
71023,Address by the Chairperson of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegović on the occasion of marking Europe Day on 9 May 2016 in Sarajevo,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=71023&langTag=en-US,2016-05-09,"Openness, unity in diversity, mutual respect and tolerance are such values which Bosnia and Herzegovina, its peoples and citizens have shared with Europe. I am certain that it is neither exaggerated nor pretentious to say that Bosnia and Herzegovina and this city in which different houses of worship almost lean on one another is a precursor of the spirit of a united Europe.
Dear excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, today we are marking Europe Day and Victory in Europe Day.
We are marking and celebrating decades of peace, decades of development, cooperation and freedom.
The Old continent resisted the evil of Nazi totalitarianism and Fascist monism – of the darkness which had engulfed the whole continent.
Without the 9th May 1945 there would not have been the May of 1950.
Therefore, first of all, let me express my warmest congratulations to you on the occasion of Victory in Europe Day.
Europe Day marks a seemingly modest beginning of a glorious vision.
The Declaration of the French Minister Robert Schumann was initiated as an appeal to France and Western Germany to prevent next wars in Europe by uniting and coordinating their management over strategically important resources – coal and steel.
However, the principle initiated by this Resolution, on whose foundations today's European Union rests, has had far-reaching positive effects.
It is the principle of shared interest-focused cooperation, as an alternative to conflicts, which has made Europe more successful and advanced than ever.
The idea of cooperation aimed at strengthening of peace and progress has grown and broadened, branching out across the whole continent.
Obstacles to spreading to the East ceased to exist due to the fall of the Iron Curtain.
In the new century numerous new members have enriched the European family, shared new experiences and provided their contributions to further deepening of cooperation within the framework of the European Union, with a shared objective of preserving and developing democracy.
Such Europe that we have strived to reach is the Europe of open borders and open spirit.
That is not a Europe which is fenced-off and partitioned by barbed wire.
Openness, unity in diversity, mutual respect and tolerance are such values which Bosnia and Herzegovina, her peoples and citizens have shared with Europe.
I am certain that it is neither exaggerated nor pretentious to say that Bosnia and Herzegovina and this city in which different houses of worship almost lean on one another is a precursor of the spirit of a united Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen!
There is a heavy burden of history in our country.
The 9th of May is the Day of Golden Lilies for us, too, when we celebrate resistance, and the Day of Camp Detainees, when we remember the victims.
However, we are determined to learn a lesson from the conflicts we lived through, and to offer to the next generations the future of peace and progress - the European future.
Earlier this year we submitted our application for membership in the European Union. We will work diligently to meet all necessary requirements in order to be granted the candidate status by the end of 2017.
We are aware that our European course brings about an abundance of challenges as, in addition to the integration into the European Union, we must work even more diligently on the internal integration of the state, on reforms, on strengthening of the rule of law.
This process of positive reforms is equally important as the act of integration itself.
We can solve all problems, no matter how difficult or complex they may be, by joint forces – by dialogue and compromise, while being decisive to achieve the final goal.
That goal is clear – we want to be a part of an ordered, developed and united Europe."
70892,Address by the Chairperson of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegović at the 7th Sarajevo Business Forum,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70892&langTag=en-US,2016-05-04,"It is particularly important this year that Sarajevo Business Forum takes a step forward: it has exceeded its regional importance by hosting the Forum 16+1 for cooperation between the People's Republic of China and sixteen countries of Central and Eastern Europe. China is an economic generator of global importance. Its strategy of cooperation with economies of Central and Eastern Europe, whose economic impetuous has been powerful, is a huge opportunity for cooperation that will be useful for all who take part in it.
Esteemed excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the seventh Sarajevo Business Forum. I am very glad that there are so many of you in Sarajevo today. We are grateful to you for your support to this forum, whose importance has grown each year and confirmed that Sarajevo is a relevant starting point for such big business visions that we, by joint forces, have turn into reality, into development and progress.
It is also thanks to the organizers from the BBI Bank that Sarajevo Business Forum has achieved such results. The engagement of this diligent team, led by Mr Amer Bukvić has been decisive in creating and constant advancing of this event, which keeps attracting investors from the whole world to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to the region.
Since it was established, Sarajevo Business Forum has had an ambition to gather and connect business persons and investors from all over the world with business persons, entrepreneurs and politicians from the region, using our specific position in the heart of Eastern Europe – at the crossroad linking the East and the West in both geographical and civilizational sense.
It is particularly important this year that Sarajevo Business Forum takes a step forward: it has exceeded its regional importance by hosting the Forum 16+1 for cooperation between the People's Republic of China and sixteen countries of Central and Eastern Europe. China is an economic generator of global importance. Its strategy of cooperation with economies of Central and Eastern Europe, whose economic impetuous has been powerful, is a huge opportunity for cooperation that will be useful for all who take part in it.
The Chinese vision of mass investment into infrastructure and energy projects along branches of the former Silk Road was initiated in 2011. It advocates linking Asia and Europe with high quality traffic corridors, along with development of business and trade links through joint investment. Such vision of huge potential is founded in history. However, it is entirely directed at the future.
We can be proud that Bosnia and Herzegovina is recognized as a possible focal point of that vision. By virtue of her position at the crossroad between the East and the West, Bosnia and Herzegovina can play an important and active role in creating economic potential and dynamism along the new Silk Road, as a link between the Chinese economy and the European one through Central Asia, Turkey, and the Gulf states.
Esteemed friends, dear guests!
This is the year when we wish to invest all our strengths in order to turn it into a year of success. Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted an application for membership in the European Union in February. A full integration into the European Union and NATO is best way to preserve stability, security and progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These integration processes are most effective tools for transformation of our country, for achievement of democratic standards, strengthening of the rule of law, strengthening of our institutions, building of competitive market economy, creating a powerful impetuous of economic development, and for enhancing such environment which will be entrepreneurship-friendly and investment-friendly.
It is clear that capital seeks prosperous countries and regions. The prospects of our country and region are prompt integration into the European Union, followed by strengthening of economic development and growth. That is the vision which we have implemented step by step, year after year.
We have witnessed that coordinated approach have ensured significant foreign investment inflow into the whole region – particularly in the areas of energy, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism – in which the scope of projects dictates the scope of cooperation. I hope that there will be more such projects in the near future.
Bosnia and Herzegovina shares three thirds of its borders with the European Union, and implements strongly the necessary reforms at all levels in order to join the EU as soon as possible.
Investors who recognize timely the potential that we have will stay a step ahead of those who hesitate, who stay trapped in the stereotypes of Balkans turbulent history. The times of conflict are over. The times of cooperation lie ahead.
What BiH can offer to investors in various fields right now is a dynamic development of traffic infrastructure, in which a lot has been done, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
There are also investment possibilities in the energy sector, which is a backbone of our economy. In the domain of energy our potentials are among most significant in the region. Our hydro-energetic potential is ranked as the eighth in size in Europe, while we have been using only 36% of it. We are a member country of the Energy Community. We also have coal reserves amounting to 6 billion tons.
With two and a half million hectares of arable land in the zones of continental, but also of the Mediterranean belt, our agriculture is capable of producing various fruits and vegetables, including the ones of highest quality – i.e. organic, for which there is a competitive demand from the developed markets.
The sector of tourism in our country has been constantly growing, and its full expansion is still ahead. We are ranked as the sixth destination per growth in tourist arrivals. It is estimated that by 2020 this market segment will have an annual growth of 10%.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a signatory of the Central European Free Trade Agreement, which enables access to the market of almost 27 million consumers in Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania and Moldova for the products from our country. We have the Free Trade Agreement with Turkey, and preferential import regimes with the European Union, Canada, Japan, Russia, and the United States of America. Our currency is stable because it is pegged to the euro, which is why we do not have currency fluctuations. Our inflation rate is extremely low.
Our workers are skilled, knowledgeable, educated and they work at competitive prices. Our administrative structures have worked diligently on creating investment-friendly conditions by implementing accelerated reforms. Today foreign investors in Bosnia and Herzegovina have the same rights as the domestic ones. The tax rate for corporations is fixed at 10% and there is no capital gains tax, whereas imports of equipment needed for investment are exempt from customs duty.
We are determined to create a space for enhancement of domestic investment in the real sector of the economy and for strengthening of the private sector. The focus of our development is strategically focused on small and medium enterprises, which have been proven as best generators of economic growth. We have worked on reforms which will ultimately improve the business environment, remove administrative obstacles, and put public administration at service of investors and entrepreneurs.
Dear friends!
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country of cordial and welcoming people, a country of rich history. Sarajevo is an open and cosmopolitan centre, in which friends from all parts of the world have been hosted with warm and cordial welcome.
I wish you to feel comfortable as our guests, while exchanging experiences and ideas, creating new partnerships and building new visions.
I wish you successful and fruitful work during the seventh Sarajevo Business Forum."
70811,Address at the Croatian National Theatre by the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Bakir Izetbegović on the occasion of the solemn academy marking the 100th anniversary of the legal and institutiona,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70811&langTag=en-US,2016-04-27,"Dear Madam President of the Republic of Croatia, dear President of the Republic of Turkey, esteemed representatives of the Government and the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia, esteemed Grand Mufti of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, esteemed president of the Mesihat of the Islamic Community in the Republic of Croatia, esteemed officials of other religious communities, your excellences, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a true honour and a great pleasure to be with you today.
I extend my congratulations the authorities and the citizens of the Republic of Croatia on the occasion of this valuable jubilee.
Historical zeal, which has borne fruit, has brought Croatia into the new century.
It is not by coincidence that, after all grave challenges it lived through, Croatia has progressed parallel to the growth and affirmation of the Islamic Community in this country.
Nowadays, Croatia is a bright example that, in a contemporary European society, it is possible indeed to arrange the relationship between a state and an Islamic community on the basis of true integration-focused principles.
While Muslims in some European states have been struggling spasmodically to preserve their identity and protect their religious and civil rights, they have had full access to such rights in Croatia.
Such Muslims are reputable Croatian citizens who have contributed in all areas to the state and the society.
The way in which Croatia solved the status and position of Muslims should direct and inspire others in Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The presence and activity of Muslim intellectuals from Bosnia and Herzegovina in the late 19th and early 20th century in Zagreb, in both cultural and political sense, is closely related to the chronology of the official recognition of Islam in Croatia.
The Bosniaks laid foundations of the Islamic Community in Croatia as we know it today.
They brought from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia their experience of co-existence and tolerance, accumulated over centuries. Numerous historic examples have borne witness to such experience, including the presence of the Bosnian Franciscans, which has lasted for almost eight hundred years, the arrival of the Spanish Jews, who found refuge in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the exodus - when no one else in Europe wanted to shelter them.
Moreover, in the course of the most recent aggression against the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not a single church, monastery or synagogue got devastated in towns with Muslim majority population.
The Bosniaks have reciprocated Croatia in many ways.
They have demonstrated their belonging to this country, without hesitation or calculation.
Reputable artists and sportsmen, over 25,000 participants in the defence of the Republic of Croatia, as well as numerous silent and diligent neighbours have woven their lives into the progress of this state. The latter have done so outside the public arena.
Driven by the experience from their homeland, the Muslim Bosniaks have integrated effortlessly into the Croatian and other European host towns – while contributing with what was most valuable to these social environments, and accepting from them their positive experience and values in return.
Diversity should be our shared treasure today, too. Diversity should not be treated as a subject of controversy, divergence or conflict.
Muslim Bosniaks are a proof that the Islamic values have enhanced Europe to the same extent to which the European values have enhanced the overall Muslim community.
We have witnessed that Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia have served more and more often as a good example applicable to the integration of a hundred thousand Muslims who have sought refuge in Europe from the horrors of war and violence.
Islam is not alien to Europe, nor is it alien to her spirit.
To the contrary, what we now know as the spirit of Europe would probably not have existed without the participation and contribution of Islam in, literally, all areas of social live: from religion and philosophy, through arts, politics, economics, and state administration, to natural sciences, crafts, and even culinary art.
If Europe would try to eliminate systematically all Islamic elements and influences from her heritage, her own foundations would have collapsed.
The present Europe is home to over 20 million Muslims, who have become her increasingly important social segment.
They have been an integral part of the European culture and the best bridge for dialogue, understanding and cooperation between Europe and the Muslim world.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
There are plenty of reasons for us to be proud tonight.
However, all of us will be filled with even more pride if we use our knowledge and wisdom to enhance the position of minorities throughout Europe in our respective contexts.
It is thanks to all religions and cultures in Croatia that we are marking this jubilee tonight.
Each one of them should consider their own internal relations as an example of a commitment to the fundamental values important for all man – such as the value of life and respect for its integrity, the value of faith and respect for its diverse expressions.
The protection of human dignity and respect for each and every one's specialness are such values that should be carefully nurtured and maintained by a modern society.
Therefore, let us keep opening doors towards other religions and different cultures, assured that cultural and religious diversity do not restrain or restrict anyone.
This has to be a vision of our shared future!
Thank you!"
70799,The speech given by BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović at the official opening of the annual meeting of the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ),https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70799&langTag=en-US,2016-04-25,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Esteemed Excellences, Dear guests! It is my honour and pleasure to address you at such a great and important gathering of professionals from all parts of Europe and the world, dedicated to the topic which I consider extremely important – the freedom of expression and journalists’ rights.
First, I would like to express my sincere regret that the member of the delegation of the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, Mr Omar Nazzal is not with us today. I most strongly condemn the action of the Occupation Forces which arrested him at the border passing of al-Karameh. I hope that your colleague will be freed as soon as possible.
The new century changes the rules of journalism brining increasingly greater challenges. Development and progress in the field of technology is speedier than ever before – journalists, in their everyday work, have to follow these trends, and governments need to create legislative frameworks speedier and with more flexibility than was the case in the past, so that both would keep the pace up with the times. The public, the space in which media and politics intertwine, often has no understanding nor patience for it. Traditional media relent under the market pressures, and new media set new rules of the game. What is good in all that is the widening of space for interaction of citizens, media and governments.
Technology brings about new dynamics, but the essence of democrating forming of public opinion and relations within it remain the same: politicians, those in power or in opposition crave influence, and control over media. Media, on the other hand, crave more freedom, as well as more influence. Many politicians control journalists, and some journalists would like to control politicians.
I believe the freedom of expression is of crucial importance for development of a democratic society, and a guarantee of development and preservation of democratic conscience in general public. However, what is often forgotten is that freedom also means responsibility. I am not talking here about the responsibility towards the government, opposition, politicians – but about the responsibility for every publicly spoken word and responsibility towards citizens.
Trust is hard to gain, easy to lose, and for a success of a society trust is essential. This means that in the work of the media, and in relations between media and government, it is of crucial significance to establish quality standards at the highest level. This ranges from the legislative framework, which will protect journalists from prosecution, public personalities from slander, and citizens from manipulations – from professional and ethical norms and codices, as well as regulatory and self-regulatory mechanisms which will enable public to trust media because it is from them that the citizens seek and expect timely, truthful and complete information.
In the fourth decade of democratic transition, at the door step of the third decade of peace, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made progress in the field of establishment of democratic institutions and forming of a democratic public. We are aware that there is a lot more effort ahead of us, but the goal is clear and achievable: a democratic political framework worthy of the state which aspires to become an EU member state at soonest, free and various media, and an informed citizenry."
70676,Address by the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Bakir Izetbegović at the central solemn event marking the 11th anniversary of the Armed Forces of BiH 2nd Infantry (Ranger) Unit and the 24th annive,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70676&langTag=en-US,2016-04-15,"Dear Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina members and generals,
Esteemed representatives of the families of shaheeds and fallen soldiers, and all combatants’ associations,
Esteemed representatives of all levels of legislative and executive authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Representatives of military and diplomatic missions, media, and all guests participating in this event dedicated to marking the 24th anniversary of the Army of the Republic of BiH and the 11th anniversary of the Armed Forces of BiH 2nd Infantry (Ranger) Unit,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Today, when we renew our commitment to remembering the historical role of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is worth recalling some most important features which determined indelibly the historical dimension of establishment, performance and durability of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian armed force, which represents the essence of the enigma known as “The miracle of the Bosnian resistance“.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina resembled its people. From its foundation and earliest activities, in addition to its military professionalism, it has also nurtured some distinctive values of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian spirituality, as well as of the characteristics of the peoples who live in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in earlier decisive moments in history, when viability and subjectivity of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina were defended, the Bosniaks constituted majority within the Army structure. However, it is equally important to underline that all BiH peoples took part in defence of freedom and independence of their homeland.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina differed from its opponents. Although it was faced with brutal attacks, mass crimes, destruction of religious and cultural treasures, and violence from a much better armed and equipped aggressor, it strived to conduct its defensive struggle parallel to respecting the high moral and military norms. Such respect had ensured its first and decisive victory – the Republic of BiH Army had first achieved supremacy and victory in terms of morality, and then it started winning its battles at the battlefield, too.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was fighting for the universal values of civilisation and humanity. In its defensive and freedom-loving expedition, the Republic of BiH Army was recognizable for respecting the universal values of civilisation and morality – it fought against killing of the weak and the unprotected, against devastation of religious and cultural monuments of any affiliation, and for protection of many other universal principles and norms, which ensured affection and support it received from a number of justice-loving and freedom-loving countries from all over the world. Such support is present nowadays, too, and it is very important for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its integration into the family of most democratic and most advanced countries of the world.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina stands for one of the most obvious examples of invincibility of the people. It emerged from the people, resembled its people, and was close to its people. Thus, the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a bright illustration of invincible power of the people, of their indestructible and invincible energy and ability to cope with temptations and challenges of any intensity or duration.
The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is yet another philosophical and practical illustration of the belief that smaller and weaker armies, when fighting for just causes, can defeat larger and stronger opponents. Justifiability of causes the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was fighting for, despite all deficiencies and limitations it was faced with, particularly in the early phase of the war, stands for one of the most distinctive reasons and explanations why the strength of the members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as of the Army in its entirety, were growing over time, why the Army of the Republic of BiH thrived and created the final preconditions for the defence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Committed to the future of a democratic and multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Army of the Republic of BiH has never exhibited triumphalism, including at times when others expected it to do so. It has demonstrated piety to its shaheeds and fallen combatants, respect to all categories of disabled war veterans, and gratitude to all its members who contributed to the defence and liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Convinced that in times that lie ahead Bosnia and Herzegovina will have an increasingly recognizable face showing unity of its diversity, we are grateful to all members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we extend our deepest respect to all those who built their lives, parts of their bodies and health into the possibilities of a continued existence and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We hope that any new anniversary of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be marked in such Bosnia and Herzegovina which will grow more and more free, democratic and prosperous."
70614,Address by the Chairperson of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegović at the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) Heads of States Summit in Istanbul,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70614&langTag=en-US,2016-04-14,"President Erdoğan, Secretary General Madani, Your Excellences, Your Highnesses, Excellences, as-salāmu ʿalaykum (peace be upon you)!
I am honoured to address the thirteenth Summit of the Organisation of Islamic Conference. I would like to extend the expression of my gratitude to my dear brother – President Erdoğan, and to the Government of the Republic of Turkey for their hospitality. I congratulate them for taking over the chairmanship, and for hosting this summit. Let me extend my most sincere congratulations to the Secretary General – His Excellence Iyad Madani for his skilful leadership over the Organisation, and let me thank him for promoting the participation of my country at this summit. We appreciate very much indeed the support provided by this organisation and its members to development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a democratic, multiethnic and multicultural state. On behalf of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of her people, let me thank you for your efforts invested in improving the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We believe that a full integration into the European Union and NATO is the best way to achieve stability, security and prosperity in Bosnia. The process of European and Euro-Atlantic integration is the most efficient tool of transforming our country and society, aimed at attaining modern democratic standards, building a competitive market economy and enhancing our economic development. I am certain that, throughout this process of maturing, we will achieve an internal consensus to file an application for membership in this organisation in the near future. In the meantime, we will do our best in order to strengthen and improve our relations and cooperation with this organisation and its member countries respectively.
The Muslim world has been faced with serious challenges, including terrorism, sectarian violence and armed conflicts – to name a few most dangerous ones. Unity, solidarity and reconciliation among the Muslim countries are necessary for addressing these challenges. We have to join forces in order to find new approaches and right solutions to the problems that we have been faced with. Negative trends can only be stopped by a coordinated action of the united Islamic ummah (community).
We shared your concern about a continued implosion of peace and stability in the world, particularly in the Near East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has lasted for over 60 years, has been the main and constant source of instability in the Near East. The standstill in finding a solution to this conflict is worrying. A New incentive for negotiations is urgently needed there. We have strongly supported the current Quartet initiative on holding a peace conference, which will bring about a durable and just solution to the Palestinian issue, based on the principles of the international law, as well as on a consensus about peaceful coexistence of the two independent and sovereign states. This is the only realistic way in which the conflict can be solved. Peace in the world has also been jeopardized by violence and crimes committed against the Syrian people. The images from Syria have reminded us of the tragedy of Bosnia – we in Bosnia have also felt the pain of the Syrian people as our own pain. It is deeply concerning that the most powerful countries in the world, including the most powerful Muslim countries, have failed so far to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria.
Bosnia fully supports the Geneva peace talks. The Syrian people have to decide on the future of Syria. A peaceful future of Syria is based on respecting the political will of the Syrian people, who must be allowed to demonstrate such will at a free and democratic election. If the will of the Syrian people were respected from the start, this war would not have taken place at all. I hope that this summit will contribute to peace and democracy to be established in brotherly Syria.
The plague of terrorism has affected all of us. It is unbearably sad for the whole of Islamic ummah that some of our mentally disturbed sons have spread death and destruction throughout the world. Bosnia condemns in strongest terms the recent terrorist attacks in Ankara, Brussels, Istanbul and Lahore. We would like to extend our deepest condolences and our express our most sincere solidarity with the families of the victims, as well as with the governments and peoples of Belgium, Turkey and Pakistan.
Bosnia, too, has been affected by the phenomenon of a radical interpretation of Islam, which has resulted in violent extremism and terrorist acts in the previous few years. Deviant ideology of tafsir has found a fertile soil in the post-war Bosnian society. We were late in recognizing the dangers represented by such ideology because it is in contradiction with our own inner beings, and with our understanding of Islam. For half of the millennium, the Bosnian Muslims have practiced an inclusive Islam, protecting and supporting diversity and cultural pluralism in our society. Exclusiveness, radicalism, violent extremism and terrorism are absolutely unacceptable from the position of Islam. Such features undermine the Islamic value system and are in contradiction with the universal values of tolerance and coexistence – which have been nurtured in Bosnia for centuries, and which we have been proud of indeed.
Islam stands for light, peace, goodness, forgiveness and reconciliation. It is our duty to defend Islam from darkness, evil, violence and hatred. We have to defend a bright and beautiful face of Islam. However, we also have to oppose anything that is contributing to the growth of radicalism or extremism in our societies. We have to eliminate injustice, inequalities, reduce poverty and unemployment, particularly among the young, while offering them hopes and new opportunities.
Political, economic and social injustice against Muslims throughout the world have contributed to the growth of desperation and desolation, and created fertile soil for the phenomena of radicalism and extremism. We are now faced with the problem whose roots are deep and complex. Our governments ought to and will use force and repressive measures to respond to violence. However, such components of our response must be both surgically precise and selective because, should they not be so, they will trigger a new wave of radicalisation. The real struggle and the final victory must and can be won at an ideological level only.
The key to a solution lies in the authentic interpretation of our Islamic tradition and in development of such contemporary social and political practices which are consistent with the authentic principles and teachings of Islam. United in our solidarity, we must seek global solutions in order to root out the causes of radicalism and violent extremism. Bosnia is committed to strengthening and deepening our mutual cooperation, as well as to preventing and fighting against terrorism.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has gathered the Muslim world and represented its collective voice. However, the Muslim communities of Europe – which are important parts of the Islamic ummah – have not been adequately represented in the Organisation. Europe is home to over 20 million Muslims. Some of them, like Bosniaks, are autochthonous European peoples, who have inhabited the European continent for centuries. In addition to them, millions of Muslims have arrived to Europe either within global migration processes in the second half of the previous century, or within the current dramatic migration wave. Their integration into the European societies has remained a challenge, to which this organisation should pay a particular attention.
Islam is neither a foreigner in Europe, nor alien to the European spirit. To the contrary, without the contribution of Islam to establishment of the European identity and culture, the European spirit, as we know it now, would not have existed. Muslims have sought to preserve their identity and protect their rights, while constantly trying to find a formula for integration and inclusion, for a functional combination of Islamic and European values. The European Muslims represent an invaluable social, cultural, political and economic resource for the whole of Islamic ummah. They are the best bridge for dialogue, understanding and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe, particularly at the times of crisis and evident growth of intolerance and prejudices against Islam.
Therefore, I believe that it is of utmost importance and urgency to find a mechanism which would enable the European Muslims to receive more attention and have more significant representation in this organisation. I hereby invite the esteemed Summit to consider most seriously a possibility to establish a European group within this organisation, modelled after African, Asian and Arab group examples respectively. I hope that you will support this proposal because the European Muslims need and deserve the attention and assistance of this organisation and of its member states in addressing the challenges, which keep multiplying.
Thank you.

70693,Address by the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Bakir Izetbegović at the opening ceremony of the “19th International Economic Fair Mostar“,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70693&langTag=en-US,2016-04-12,"Dear organizers, esteemed businessmen, dear president Vujanović, president Grabar-Kitarović, prime minister Vučić, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş, ladies and gentlemen! It is my utmost pleasure to be with you again at the opening of the “International Economic Fair Mostar“, a manifestation which has grown into one of most important fairs in the country, as well as in the whole region.
Since it was founded, Mostar has been a city which has connected people, a city of businesspersons, a city of tradesmen, a junction point, and a meeting place. I am glad that this tradition is continuing, that Mostar keeps gathering businesspersons, including those who run large and small business, domestic and foreign investors. Mostar is an active and efficient centre, whose importance keeps growing from year to year slowly but surely. This kind of manifestation is precious because it sends to the world a positive message on both Mostar and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fifty thousand visitors are expected to attend this year's Fair. I am certain that their number will continue to increase in the years to follow.
I am particularly glad that the Republic of Turkey is this year's partner country of the Fair. The cooperation in all areas between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey has been enhanced in the previous years. Between 2013 and 2015, BiH exports to Turkey doubled, amounting to over three hundred and fifty million Bosnian Convertible Marks, whereas the export - import coverage ratio has risen by around 20 percent. And this is, I am convinced, only the beginning, given that there is a lot of room for cooperation, and there is mutual willingness and eagerness to deepen this cooperation. I believe that the growth of the Turkish economy will continue in the future, and that the interest for investment to BiH will increase.
There are many areas in which such cooperation can be enhanced in the future right here, in Herzegovina. First of all, I would like to underline the areas of tourism and agriculture, which have been the axes of such cooperation. Therefore, it is very good that there are a number of additional events within the present event, including the Tourism Fair. With a bit of effort invested, Herzegovina can lead in this economic field, not only within the framework of BiH, but regionally, too. The tourism offer in Mostar will be enriched early next year with an opening of the restored Hotel “Ruža“ (Rose). The restoration was funded by the Turkish Ziraat Bank. This hotel will be available to host the guests who will attend the next fair.
Before almost two months, BiH filed her application for membership in the EU. Despite all our differences, disagreements, and conflicts from the past, we have had the strength to recognize the path which leads to the future. That path is the one of progress and integration, and it will enable our citizens to use all their advantages fully. Let me remind you that our currency is stable, regulations are investment-friendly and ensure safe foreign investment inflow, our energy sources are significant, we have remarkable natural beauty and cultural heritage, and, above all, we have a sufficient number of skilled and educated people who are ready to work hard.
When I delivered my speech at the opening of the 17th Mostar Fair in 2014, the environment in the country was different. At that time, we had seen mass riots and buildings set on fire. Catastrophic floods of the unimaginable scope were about to strike at that time, too. However, we have overcome all the difficulties, preserved the stability, and now we have the reason for being optimistic again. We have based such optimism on our aspiring to achieve a common goal, i.e. the progress for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the progress for all who live in it.
We wish betterment and progress to our neighbours, too. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been committed to ensuring closest economic cooperation with her neighbouring countries – Montenegro, Croatia and Serbia. It is good that in the current period we have shared the same determination to achieve what Croatia achieved already – a membership in the EU. Furthermore, it is good that we have been ready to help each other progress in that direction.
Bosnia and Herzegovina can do better, as indicated by the changes we initiated in the previous year, the changes within which we committed ourselves to dialogue, compromise and reforms aimed at achieving progress. Events such as this Fair are concrete steps taken in that direction.
I extend my congratulations to the organizer for the effort invested, and I wish to all a successful and fruitful work at the Fair.
Thank you."
70694,Speech delivered by the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Bakir Izetbegović on the occasion of marking the 70th anniversary jubilee of the Faculty of Law in Sarajevo,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70694&langTag=en-US,2016-04-06,"Dear Chancellor of the University of Sarajevo, dear Dean of the Faculty of Law, esteemed professors and students, dear guests, your excellences, ladies and gentlemen! Law has been studied in Sarajevo and in BiH since the 19th century. Over a century ago, the College for Sharia Judges was established, which taught courses in law and legal science, and was one of the foundations of the current Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo, established in 1946.
In the course of its fruitful history, this Faculty has contributed significantly to further dissemination of knowledge on law and to the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the rule of law, while capacitating generations of judges, attorneys and other specialists in various legal fields.
Throughout various historical circumstances, this reputable institution has nurtured high standards of legal profession, regardless of a side its cadre has occupied as judges, prosecutors or attorneys. Such contribution of the Faculty has been most significant and durable to development of the profession and enhancement of knowledge and necessary educational standards in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is worth pointing out that the Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo has operated well beyond its sole service provider role in education. It has also, to a considerable extent, educated young people in the spirit of our tradition, which requires that we respect our history, origin and diversity of our cultural and religious space.
It is of particularly important for future generations to continue to develop themselves in the same spirit, as well as in the spirit of those statesmen and scientists who marked this institution, including Aleksandar Solovjev, Hamdija Čemerlić, Alija Izetbegović, Sulejman Tihić, Kasim Begić, Vlado Jokanović, Samuel Kamhi, and others.
Such process is a continuous and demanding one indeed, and it includes re-defining of objectives, needs and agency for our whole community.
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
After renewal of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo has continued delivering its rich scientific and educational agency. Such agency is particularly important nowadays, given the primary task of Bosnia and Herzegovina and her active inclusion in Euro-Atlantic integration processes.
All important processes and relations in a modern state are regulated by laws. Well educated professionals from the field of law are the only ones who can create good and high quality laws. Only high quality and good laws can build a stable and prosperous state.
Political and social reforms are neither an easy nor a simple process.
Such reforms demand that we harmonize legislation, state administration and judiciary with the European norms and criteria. It is precisely within these processes that we expect the Faculty of Law in Sarajevo to be an active actor in harmonizing the rule of law in BiH with the EU legal framework, regulating market and modern competitive economy, in developing of a democratic state committed to respecting the human rights, rule of law and values of the international order, particularly at this time of Bosnia and Herzegovina's submission of her credible application for membership in the EU.
We have not implemented reforms due to our European path only.
This obligation is, at the same time, a basic interest of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina because a developed, democratic and prosperous state is an ultimate objective for all.
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
Let us do everything we can in order to convey to our young people an idea and a drive on advancing and preserving the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
If we work like that, I am convinced that our prospects will be good, and our future among other European states will be bright and certain.
With such wishes, I extend my congratulations to the management, professors, and, in particular, the students of the Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo on the occasion of marking this valuable 70th anniversary jubilee of its work and existence."
70993,Address delivered by the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Bakir Izetbegović at the solemn academy marking the 24th anniversary of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=70993&langTag=en-US,2016-04-06,"Esteemed “Bosna“ Special Unit members, dear friends! I extend my congratulations to you on the occasion of marking the 24th anniversary of the first war action and beginning of the war path of the RBiH Ministry of Interior Special Unit – the Police Squad “Bosna“.
While preparing this speech, I was thinking if there was anything more that one could say about the people who were at the first lines acting as organizers and most powerful link in a chain of resistance in most critical times of defending the city of Sarajevo and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in times when there was a thin line dividing our survival and destruction, when it was questionable, under a strike of the brutal aggression, whether we would succeed in preserving sobriety and gathering people...
Is there anything more one can say about the people who could already see everything clearly at that time, and who were ready to give up everything for the freedom of this country?
It seems that, in the course of the last two decades, we have used all expressions of gratitude in order to show them our understanding of how sincere their struggle was, how great their courage was, and how deserved our ultimate victory was.
However, we should not get tired of expressing our gratitude because those who do not learn from their past, and who do not recall it, live through the same or similar adversities again. Therefore, we will re-iterate and remember, and seek anew such words which will be our reminder that those best among us were members of the Special Squad “Bosna“.
A multiethnic composition of this Squad is a synonym of the whole Army of BiH, consisting of all patriots of this country, regardless of their religious or national affiliation. The very fact that a significant number of the Serbs and Croats wished to join this unit on voluntary basis speaks about the character of its establishment, which was both sincere a spontaneous.
The first Bosnian special force member who got killed was Ozrenko Mandić-Buco, who defended his and our homeland from Karadžić' army.
Vinko Šamarlić, a pre-war special force member and a top athlete, got killed during the attempt of the special force members to unblock Sarajevo, just a day before he was supposed to depart from Sarajevo in order to participate in the Olympic Games in Barcelona.
On behalf of these people, who chose struggle and freedom in the decisive times when one was choosing between disappearance and survival, we cannot allow that remembrance of their sacrifice and their courage fades away, that the generations who are maturing and gradually taking over this country think that our current peace and freedom have been achieved and inherited easily.
There is no other way but to re-iterate and recall. All peoples who turned their struggle into healthy and functional states built such states on inherited values carved out by the people such as Dragan Vikić and Vinko Šamarlić, Kemal Ademović and Ozrenko Mandić.
I am encouraged by the fact that I can now see ex-members of the Special Squad “Bosna“in our highest legislative and executive bodies. They are a guarantee that we will, sooner or later, in these peace-time struggles which may not be as hard as the war-caused challenges, defend our values for which we have remained loyal to this country at all times through generations.
Loyal to God, and loyal to Bosnia - as it was nicely said by the late friar Petar Anđelović.
Challenges are still ahead of us, including arduous political and economic reforms, as well as changes that we have to make on our path to the European Union. It sometimes seems that, in such political spinning wheel, the pictures from the past are fading away, that we forget, under the weight of responsibilities and pressures, how expensive each piece of this country, which we defended, was.
But, there is no oblivion! In each next temptation we will keep deriving our strength from that remembrance, from memories about the heroes of Bosnia, about the sons who cancelled the Olympic Games, weddings and careers because Bosnia and Herzegovina was more important. That is why they need to be woven into each detail, each step forward which we will make.
God bestowed physical strength and courage on many people. However, rare are the ones who will use such gift in most selfless way – who will enhance their skills through laborious training sessions and abstinence, and then expose themselves to wounds and death, while protecting the weaker ones from strong and dangerous violators and attackers. Only the ones who are chosen and best dare to and can protect citizens, peoples, and the state from any sort of criminals, attackers or aggressors. I am honoured to have met most of you personally in most difficult days this city of ours and this country lived through.
Special forces members, courageous and good people, sincere Bosnians and Herzegovinians, I extend my congratulations of this anniversary to you from the very bottom of my heart."
69870,Speech delivered by Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Dr. Dragan Čović at the reception to mark Independence Day of BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=69870&langTag=en-US,2016-03-01,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, Your Eminence, Your excellences! It is my special privilege to be able to welcome you tonight, on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, of course, on my own behalf, on the occasion of marking Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As you can see, I will avoid any stereotypical reading of a speech, but you will allow me to feel free to bring a bit more of emotion into it on this day because I believe that the current day and the current time in Bosnia and Herzegovina deserve it.
Therefore, dear friends, at the time when we are marking Independence Day, we are still very exposed on all sides, we are very vulnerable both as an organization and as a social community, and, as you can notice, I have greeted you on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, although not all three Presidency members are together.
However, this does not diminish neither the importance of this day nor the importance of history and times that all of us have lived through together. But, there is a particular commitment, which all three Presidency members made some one year and three or four months ago, that they would not make a single decision which would question the institution they represent, that, each time when they would go anywhere either individually or together, they would represent their homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina wholeheartedly.
And that is what, exactly, will be our attitude to the current day this evening. Therefore, I extend my thanks from the bottom of my heart to all of you who are here, thank you for being here, and to all those who are listening to this speech I extend, from the bottom of my heart, my congratulations on the occasion of Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I am certain that the current time deserves a few words to be said on the past, but only a few words on the past, given that I am sure that we, from our present perspectives, have at least three different views on that past. And, I am not sure that we can change that easily.
I am certain, though, that there is something else that we can do together. We can think together in a harmonized way about the shared future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That makes me happy, and that is what we will do together on behalf of the Presidency and all institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on behalf of the executive, legislative and political authorities. You can also understand my tonight’s greeting to you, as well as our gathering tonight, as an incentive to do much more for Bosnia and Herzegovina than what we have done so far.
Let us not focus all the time on our differences, on what is separating us in a certain way, but let us look upon, in a particular way, the ways of creating such an environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will ensure that this is a country to which people will return, in which they will stay, and in which they will want to live. As I re-iterated a number of times, there is no country in the world that is more beautiful, and it depends entirely on ourselves how well we are going to live here.
To you, dear friends, your excellences who represent international institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I extend my deepest gratitude for the attention you have given us in the last 20 and more years. I am sure that we can expect you to continue paying your attention to us in the following period, too. Bosnia and Herzegovina does have its future indeed. I am sure that it is, above all, a Euro-Atlantic future.
Therefore, I am proud that, as the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH, I can now, a little while after the submission of our application for EU membership, assert that we have made a giant step forward, regardless of how we perceive it within Bosnia and Herzegovina, and regardless of how we perceive Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, how anyone contemplates, doubts if we have deserved it, if we are credible, and if we are trustworthy. I am convinced that the time has never been better for submission of such application, and that it is up to us, together with our friends from the European Union and beyond, and with friends from the international institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina which have commitments towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, to continue to work faster, and that we will receive a positive opinion in the course of the current year, and that we will also become a candidate for the European Union membership in the course of the next year.
There is not a single reason for us not to make another giant step forward in May and June this year, also, and not to activate our action plan regarding our membership in the NATO Alliance.
Also, I believe that you can help us a lot in this endeavour of ours, but we have to be trustworthy ourselves, and show readiness to make key, bold decisions. I think that the previous period was not characterized by such attitude.
I am convinced that we have made a key step forward, despite all the challenges that we have been faced with. The remaining tasks are now those that we have to carry out at the domestic plan.
I cannot see a single reason why anyone would consider it a division of the country if we have to ensure information sharing in a language of constitutive peoples. I cannot see why it would be a problem and division if anyone requests to select representatives on behalf of their own people. That is why I am convinced that we will have the wisdom, courage, decisiveness, patriotism and love of this homeland of ours Bosnia and Herzegovina to pass our election law shortly, in order to resolve the issue of the judgement made by the court in Strasbourg, the issue of our Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding the City of Mostar, and many other issues which would include us in the group of more orderly and more organized countries in our surroundings.
Of course, the key issue is the one of living conditions of those, primarily the unemployed, who depend on politics. These are pensioners; these are many groups of people who have struggled daily to provide for their basic living needs. I am convinced that this is, perhaps, one of the key issues that we have to resolve at the domestic front, and, I will underline it again – we have to do it ourselves.
We will not succeed without new jobs, without investments. Yet, I am sure that we have so many interested friends from abroad. It is for that fact only that, for me, the submission of the application for membership is a great act. It has to motivate us, encourage us strongly to pass laws promptly at both state and entity levels, as well as at all other administrative levels, i.e. such laws which will promote the values of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and enhance investment inflow to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I think that the time has come for us to close down on admission to the state institutions and public companies. We have spent huge amounts of money on exactly those areas in which we should not be spending. If we succeed in celebrating one of the following anniversaries – i.e. 1 March 2017 or 1 March 2018 - in the way that we do not re-open such issues in this way, then we will have succeeded for sure, and then we will have a full membership in the European Union and NATO Alliance.
Regardless of when will we become full members of these institutions, I am convinced that there is sufficient decisiveness today for such membership, even among those who negate the current day. We should not confront our ideas and discussions about the current day. It is a historic date for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately, we do not have the power to pass strong decisions concerning, for example, the law on religious holidays. It is in that realm that everything is given to us by God, and yet, we still do not have sufficient wisdom to pass a decision ourselves. How can one expect, then, that we make a decision on public holidays at the state level? Let these, simply, remain the issues that we will harmonize smoothly along our way. In the meantime, let us build such an environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which it is worth living, in which it is worth investing efforts dedicated to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, therefore, I kindly ask all of you, from the bottom of my heart, all of us from Bosnia and Herzegovina, to do a bit more than we have done so far for our motherland. It is when we do it that things will be better for all. You, our friends who come from abroad, do continue to follow and criticize. You do not have to do it in public, but do provide us with your criticism when you see that we do something in a slow or bad way, and do encourage us to keep moving forward. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a guarantor of stability in the whole of eastern and western areas around us, and I hope that I do not have to convince anyone of that.
Finally, thank you, once again, for responding to this invitation. I would like to inspire you to keep providing us with strength, encouragement to work on the Euro-Atlantic project of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to work on internal stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina together, in which we will enhance economy and ensure social stability because we are not sufficiently socially sensitive now. There are too many of those who are in need.
Finally, to all of you who have Bosnia and Herzegovina in your hearts, I extend my greetings on the occasion of Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish you all the best, and cheers!"
69750,Press statement by the Chairperson of BiH Presidency Dr. Dragan Čović and the President of the Republic of Albania Bujar Nishani,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=69750&langTag=en-US,2016-02-24,"Dr. Dragan Čović, the Chairperson of BiH Presidency: Dear Mr President, esteemed guests, dear friends, welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I am glad that we have hosted a truly friendly visit today for the president of the country with which Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have any unresolved issues, the president of the country with which Bosnia and Herzegovina wishes to build excellent relations at cultural, economic and any other plan in general.
Through our previous discussions, we informed the esteemed guest delegation on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the role of the three-member Presidency in accelerating our journey on the Euro-Atlantic path, and on Bosnia and Herzegovina's taking the role of such actor who should bring about stabilization of the situation through all the surrounding area.
For Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is simply no alternative to the Euro-Atlantic course. As I reported, 10 days ago we had submitted our application for membership in the European Union. Also, we expect from our friends in Albania to provide their support in Warsaw for activating the Membership Action Plan (MAP).
Concerning the foreign policy, we wish to create more than good relations with our neighbours, we wish to try to do it ourselves, and, in cases in which we cannot solve unresolved issues ourselves, and I refer here primarily to the issues concerned with Serbia and Croatia, we will aim to do it in the spirit of friendly and good neighbourly relations, and with the assistance of our friends from the European Union.
It is our key, and I would call it historic, task in Bosnia and Herzegovina today to resist entropy which may stop us in these plans of ours, but also to provide our full contribution in order to avoid, for a longer period, thinking about destabilization of political or any other circumstances in our region.
I am sure that we will enhance our bilateral relations and, in some way, compensate for those past periods of isolation and simply, through our corridors, including traffic, energetic and any other, bring our peoples closer to each other.
As we have had an excellent mutual understanding of each other, as we have wished to build a friendly environment through our relations, I am sure that there are many possibilities for enhancement of our economic cooperation, and, in addition to that, I believe that our cultural connections, our tradition and heritage have actually had common sources throughout history.
Therefore, I believe that it is through various forms of cooperation that we should enable a more significant cooperation in the area of tourism.
What we would like is to provide our full contribution to all regional projects in which we have participated together, to connect not only Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also all those who share the same destiny in this area.
Thus, Mr. President, we hereby invite You, Your representatives of executive and legislative authorities, to participate in such initiatives, and that we simply make our bilateral relations more dynamic.
I think that we should make a number of agreements between our countries in order to carry out smoothly all the projects that we have in mind. In any case, I, once again, extend my gratitude for Your visit, I wish You to feel here as a friend among friends, and that our cooperation becomes much more successful in the future. You are most welcome to be our guest!
The President of the Republic of Albania Bujar Nishani:
I hereby extend my gratitude to You, the Chairperson of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to media representatives, and to all others who are present here. I extend my gratitude for hospitality which you have demonstrated to me and my delegation.
I would like to extend my gratitude for today's meeting of our two delegations. I would like to extend my gratitude for the topics we have initiated, which concern not only our countries, but the whole region.
Namely, we are the representatives of two countries which belong to the same region, we have a lot in common, and one of these issues we have in common is, indeed, our pursuit of the Euro-Atlantic integration.
Our relations are very good, we have no unresolved issues, our relations are also friendly, and I have availed myself of this opportunity to re-iterate an open support to sovereignty and integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We have succeeded in establishing contacts and communication at a higher level and I am assured, by my very visit and the way in which I was hosted, that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a sincere and friendly attitude towards Albania.
There is a series of agreements and contracts between our countries, which illustrate indeed such relations we have had.
Lately, a rise in exchange of goods between our two countries has been registered, and there is, certainly, a possibility that such exchange is enhanced to an even higher level.
There are sixteen companies from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Albania now. These companies have been included in various ways in industrial and economic development of Albania.
We have indeed worked towards strengthening of the economic cooperation and economic development of the two countries, which has not been reduced to our two countries only. Namely, we have also focused on the economic development at the level which is surely regional, and even wider.
One of the significant projects, which will certainly be of our mutual benefit, is the corridor of the Adriatic-Ionian Motorway.
I also mentioned today a possibility of creating a better environment for free movement of goods and persons between the two countries, and expressed my wish and hope that one day we would be able to visit these countries without passports, i.e. that we would be able to visit each other with identity cards only.
It is our shared goal to ensure free movement of goods and persons, particularly in the economic sense, because this is important. It is in this way that we can also achieve improved economic exchange.
In this sense, also, it is the Euro-Atlantic integration which is extremely important.
I am glad that recently, a few days ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina made another step towards the European Union and submitted her application for membership in the European Union.
Our country Albania already made such step. We have expected the next one in that direction.
I now avail myself of the opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole, for all steps they have made, including numerous reforms, in order to get closer to the European Union.
I have also expressed my firm support to Bosnia and Herzegovina for her integration into NATO, in the same way in which we expressed such support for any other country in the region with such aspirations.
In this sense, Albania fully supports all steps, including those which refer to MAP Action Plan for joining, i.e. for membership of Bosnia and Herzegovina in NATO.
I have also expressed my wish that Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others, provides her support for membership of Kosovo in the Adriatic Charter. I believe that such step will only provide an additional contribution to stabilization of our region.
In the past, this region passed indeed through difficult times and burden which made relations more difficult. However, nowadays we have had new circumstances under which our relations have been relaxed.
In this sense, my position has been expressed that the present time should be used for as better cooperation as possible.
In this sense, I have also expressed the official position of the Government of Albania that Albania is oriented to good neighbourly relations and stabilization in the region of South Eastern Europe.
I have expressed my position that, in order to have good relations within the region, inclusion of all countries in the region is necessary.
Our cooperation in the region, as well as our accession to the Euro-Atlantic integration, demands specific steps to be made.
I have also expressed a firm support to Bosnia and Herzegovina and her current role in the Brdo-Brioni initiative, within which a series of meetings will be held in May in Sarajevo. We openly support this initiative and we are glad it is happening.
In this sense, I have initiated the issue of revision or re-consideration of a possibility of recognition of Kosovo by Bosnia and Herzegovina, and of recognition of documents of Kosovo by Bosnia and Herzegovina, because I believe that such step would be good, not only for improved relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, but also for the whole region.
We have also discussed another shared interest, i.e. the coordination and cooperation in the area of security issues. We know that security has been threatened greatly by terrorism, as well as by the recent events in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, where our joint action would be needed in order to address these issues.
Finally, let me re-iterate my gratitude to the hosts for their hospitality. I believe that this visit will initiate our enhanced relations."
69177,Address by BiH Presidency Member from Republika Srpska Dr Mladen Ivanić at the Christmas reception,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=69177&langTag=en-US,2016-01-05,"Christmas – the birth of Christ – is a holiday of love, peace and family, universal values for all people and for all times. This day brings us immaterial, but life's important values which cherish the history of men and lead to salvation.
In today's troubled times, we all deep down ask ourselves – what is the key message of Christmas? How do we greet with “God's Peace“ today – because on the dawn of Christmas Orthodox Christians have for centuries been sending the message, that is, the greeting – God's Peace.
The modern man has brought the planet and nature to the brink of destruction, people are waging wars in the name of God, although they should be spreading peace and love in His name. Through the modern migration of people we are watching the pictures of the Old Testament and migrations in the Middle Ages, we are keeping ourselves from others by building wired fences. We are opposing cultures, nations, religions. We live in the world in which the values system is pretty distorted.
We measure people against our needs, not against of what they really are. Strength and will is needed to resist this illness of selfishness which has made many people unhappy throughout history.
Patriarch Pavle said – “It is difficult to be a man amongst men”. These words carry their weight, especially today when many, and not only in politics, adapt the apocalyptic recipe of evilness which states – I “alone” am the measure for everything and if there isn’t me, there won’t be you! A selfish man is not a man of community, because a community assumes love towards another, care for another.
Because of that we need to find a measure in Bosnia and Herzegovina between a totally legitimate need to preserve identity of each of our peoples, on the one hand, and the necessity of a life together, on the other. I am convinced that it is possible to achieve this measure through greater mutual trust and through willingness to compromise. It is most important that we fight for better well-being of all, that we do not steal from one another nor from the community in which we live, that we are not isolated but that we are part of a larger and let’s hope happier family of European peoples.
I wish all Serbs in Republika Srpska, but also Serbs in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our brothers in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Diaspora, as well as other Orthodox Christians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, to spend the forthcoming Christmas holidays with their closest ones in good spirit and to, at least then, forget all problems which burden our everyday living.
What is, therefore, the message of Christmas today?
The same one it was 2016 years ago and which states – love, peace, family. And this message has no alternative.
However strange these immaterial messages may sound to us in this material world – we are invited to renew them in ourselves and to live them, because out of love for a man and his salvation, God steps into this world. Out of love of God, the world and a man we celebrate Christmas and should not forget the magnificent, early Christian, ancient, but also the all-times message:
“Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace, good will toward men” (Luke, 2 14).
To all of you who came tonight I am sincerely grateful to, and I merrily greet you and your families with our traditional greeting:
God's Peace – Christ is born!"
69013,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Dr Dragan Čović at the reception marking Christmas,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=69013&langTag=en-US,2015-12-17,"Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, Your Eminences, Your Excellences, dear friends,
As in each previous year, which has become a tradition, what has gathered us here is a pre-celebration joy, which we wish to share with you. Therefore, do allow me, dear friends, to extend, as your host, as well as on behalf of the Croat people in Bosnia and Herzegovina executive, legislative and political positions holders, greetings to you from the bottom of my heart. I am glad that tonight, more than ever before, our commitment to be happy together because of this great Catholic celebration has gathered us, and for that I extend my deepest gratitude to you.
My joy would be much greater if one of the greatest Christian celebrations could be marked in the same way throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, and everywhere in the world. Unfortunately, we know it is not like that, there are more and more people in need, those who expect a next day, full of incertitude, with grave worries.
There are more and more children in the world whose parents cannot see their future. The war areas have been widened continuously, security threats have deleted borders, and we have witnessed daily most horrific crimes committed in the name of religion, nation, skin colour, and a wide variety of other diversities.
Well, let our tonight's shared wish and belief prompt minds and hearts of all those who can change the world, so that these Christmas celebrations can become celebrations of love, joy and family warmth. Let us be open to another man – our brother, let us nurture and protect diversity.
Dear friends, esteemed guests, it is possible that, tonight, in this solemn ambience, we ourselves do not have the courage to change the world. However, it is most likely that we can and must change our society, our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I would like to hear a sound argument why would we not organize our country by her men's needs, ensuring human dignity, and full constitutional equal rights for all three constituent peoples. Why would we not build a full political stability, which would ensure a sway of investment inflow, economic growth and social stability.
Our foreign policy, which has achieved results, is based on a subtle friendly good neighbourly relation, for which there is no alternative, in the same way in which there is no alternative to our Euro-Atlantic course.
We have been building a modern society in a direct way. This society is now at its turning point. Such turning point, first of all, is reflected in our clear commitment on achieving internal stability through making compromises ourselves in order to solve problems.
That same turning point must present us as credible in the Euro-Atlantic project. This means clear acceptance of the standards of the organizations we are announcing to join, so that in January we can file an application for membership in the European Union, and in June open the NATO Membership Action Plan.
There is a lot yet we have to get done together in order to, through changes of election legislation and ensuring a rational organization of Bosnia and Herzegovina, eliminate an urge for dissatisfaction to be felt by any constituent people or citizen of this beautiful country.
Finally, let the celebration of Christmas, the birth of little Jesus, provide us with both motivation and strength to express our happiness together, while building peace, prosperity, joy and love between all peoples. As Jesus Christ means stands for love itself, let faith in Him make us better people.
To all Christians I wish a merry Christmas, and to all of us I wish a happy and successful New 2016.
Dear friends, enjoy yourselves in the warmth of tonight's collectiveness. Once again, thank you for being here and may dear God guard and follow you and your dear ones."
68606,Speech delivered by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the reception on the occasion of marking the Statehood Day of BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=68606&langTag=en-US,2015-11-24,"Your excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends! I hereby extend my greetings to you both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Dragan Čović. I thank you for participating, with a wish that, after this evening's celebration, at which we traditionally mark the Statehood Day of BiH, we get to embrace, even more decisively, the possibilities lying ahead of us.
We are remembering tonight a very important date from the history of our country, the date on which the statehood of our country was renewed, and her historical and legal continuity, based on the principles of full equality of all her peoples and citizens, was confirmed. By extending my gratitude to the generation that built the foundations of the sovereignty of BiH, let me dedicate my present address to our young compatriots - those who will inherit this country soon. That is why I will talk more about the future, about a need to open up venues to hope, to open up venues towards better life and changes, and narrow down the space for anxiety, uncertainty and apathy that have troubled our youth.
I invite all of us to encourage each other on that path, assured that better days will come, and that they must come.
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
Let us not turn to the past too much, while repeating that the situation used to be better then, and that it would be hard to achieve such prosperity ever again. The living standards in this country were, actually, more modest a few decades ago. There used to be more people who were poor, illiterate, unemployed, there used to be more places without roads, water or power supplies. There used to be villages without schools and teachers. The dissolution of the state union, which BiH used to belong to, was preceded by dissolution of the economic system, marked with a tri-digit inflation rate.
That is why we should not close venues to optimism. All indicators show that this country is moving forward, despite the large scale, almost inestimable, devastation caused by the war.
We have made visible progress within less than a year:
We responded to the British-German initiative by signing BiH Presidency Statement on our commitment to Europe and on necessary reforms on the path to the EU. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement was activated.
The Reform Agenda was adopted at both the level of entities and the Council of Ministers of BiH. This happened despite the artificially generated crisis in the first half of 2015, the crisis which was aimed at paralyzing the Government of FBiH; the unfortunate event in Zvornik; and another unfortunate event which followed in Srebrenica. Even under such circumstances, we managed to stay on the course of reforms and pass a new labour law. A general political consensus was reached on the reform course of BiH. We established, for the first time in the last 10 years, a strong “reform coalition” at both Federal and state level. This coalition has implemented the ongoing reforms decisively.
Gross domestic product rate has kept growing. We have a visible industrial growth, particularly the growth rate in exports. Tourism recorded a 28% growth this year. We had 10.000 newly employed persons until 1 November, which is supporting evidence to my promise on 100.000 new jobs to be generated in the following decade. Such employment growth rate has been unprecedented in the last decade.
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
We will not allow it that the future generations make reference to our indecisiveness. Our leaders were determined 23 years ago to keep this country in her internationally recognized borders, determined to return lost freedom and peace to our peoples. The fact that we are celebrating the Statehood Day today in a free, peaceful country is enough for us to remember them with the sense of pride and gratitude.
Their courage and determination has obliged us to stop conducting our discussions, TV daily news, conferences, lectures and receptions doubting in this country and her future.
Let us start encouraging each other on the path of economic growth, employment generation, and investment growth. Let us stop counting bad news, which will always be around, let us count investments, new tourists, and new employment posts instead.
It seems that there is no better opportunity than the present one for me to invite you to join a new wave of energy, and new optimism.
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
This is our country. We have no other motherland. She is more than beautiful, a rich country, which belongs equally to all our citizens at every inch of her territory.
Let us stop making new divisions. Let us gather, invite, forgive each other, even when it seems that all bridges are destroyed and that another river shore is distant.
Let us build bridges between us. No political option carrying this country in its heart is excluded from the process of reforms, whose implementation has started. All are welcome to join and support this process.
There will be no justification for missing the current historic opportunity we have. There is no justification for weakness, indecisiveness or faintheartedness. It is the future of this country that is at stake, and we are at a historical crossroads. Let us all be aware of that shared responsibility.
It will not be enough to say that we had wishes and readiness only. What will remain, what next generations will find themselves in, in what direction we will lead this country ultimately, that is indeed what will be remembered and what will count.
Dear ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
Let us have faith in what we do for the benefit of this country and her citizens. Day by day, we will reassure all the fainthearted ones by showing that this country can, and that she does indeed move in the right direction.
Unlike now, we did not have such positive momentum a year ago. The current momentum is a benefit achieved by working, commitment, as well as belief.
In the course of the last year, we directed all our strengths to raising standards of the citizens and to the implementation of reforms. Do support us in this. Each voice of encouragement is important. Each word of support is welcome.
Seventy two years passed since the statehood of BiH had been restored, and two decades since it was confirmed in Dayton. There were deadlocks and crises in the post-Dayton period. However, I am convinced that we have finally started moving forward towards the goal which gathers all of us. It puts together me in Sarajevo, and Dragan in Mostar, and Mladen in Banja Luka, it gathers all of us in BiH. We are building a safe and prosperous future for our children and grandchildren.
In the name of this, I congratulate the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina to you. Thank you."
68623,Press statements delivered by the Chairman of the Presidency of BiH Dr Dragan Čović and President of the European Council Donald Tusk,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=68623&langTag=en-US,2015-11-24,"The Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH Dr Dragan Čović: Good afternoon. I am glad that we have hosted our dear friend Donald Tusk today. We discussed the current problems in the whole of Europe, while focusing on BiH in particular.
My colleague Izetbegović and I informed our dear friends and guests on what we were doing in BiH, as an example of behaviour which could be adopted in our wider area, shared details on our foreign policy, our European, i.e. Euro-Atlantic path, on what we accomplished internally regarding economic and social stability in BiH, reorganization within the institutions in charge of security, intelligence agency, our judiciary, in order to ensure that we could act as partners in the difficult ongoing moments at the global scene.
Security problems that surround us should by no means be used as a reason to stop us on this Euro-Atlantic path. Moreover, we believe that this is, actually, a good opportunity for BiH to strengthen everything that she failed to strengthen in the previous 10-year period, in order to ensure that we submit our application for membership and continue with commitments we have made and defined in our agenda. We also discussed the latter issue with Ms Mogherini yesterday.
In the course of the last six months, we have really worked at all administrative levels in BiH in order to change the way of thinking of all our friends from the European Union on our European course because we are aware that, due to these problems, there are not many of those in the European Union who have been thinking about enlargement. However, the current phase of our application and path towards a candidate status will also stabilize all of us in BiH; such decisions will provide additional encouragement for us to continue, with more intense dynamics, to stabilize not only BiH, but also the environment both to the east and to the west of BiH.
We are aware that our commitments to the Euro-Atlantic path, for which there is no alternative, are not made because of our friends from the European Union, but because of ourselves, because of our country, because of our citizens and, simply, as I already stated, on that path, for which there is no alternative, we must demonstrate today in practical terms that we strongly want it in each segment of our lives, at both domestic and foreign policy fronts.
We know that there are issues in BiH which we must resolve decisively. One of these issues, which keep causing certain doubts, includes the issue of the referendum in the RS. Such issues must get resolved among us within BiH by reaching our internal agreement. Of course, I, once again, extend my gratitude to Mr Tusk for his visit, his encouragement, and I am convinced that each new report prepared by the European Union will be more and more positive for us, who have been working on the front of our speedy integration into the European family.
President of the European Council Donald Tusk:
Thank you, President Čović, for finding time to meet me today. Firstly, I would like to pay my respects to the victims of the terrorist attack, which took place recently in BiH. Terrorism affects all of us, terrorism knows no borders and, as we could see from the recent terrorist attacks here in Sarajevo, but also in Paris, Ankara, Beirut, Bamako, and Sinai, the danger of terrorism has not ceased to exist. We must work together to ensure that hope and future prevail over fear and terror. This is our shared responsibility. I appreciate your commitment to solving this problem, and your efforts invested in addressing the challenge, particularly here in Sarajevo. This also implies working towards prevention of radicalization and fighting against extremism. Another challenge, the current challenge that we have been faced with now, is migration, i.e. the refugee crisis. The number of refugees moving along the migration routes, including those located across Europe, is unprecedented, and the situation has additionally worsened by the fact that the groups of refugees have been additionally, jeopardized, so to say, by those who have been trying to smuggle certain elements in these groups. In order to stay in control, it is necessary to have a comprehensive plan and a coordinated operation in the whole region. I recently visited Belgrade, and I also visited Tirana and Skopje. The European Union will organize a special summit with Turkey next week. Two weeks ago we had a special summit organized with African countries. In fact, all this is a part of a joint plan, the plan with one goal, and that goal is to stop the influx of refugees and immigrants to Europe.
All states, including the European Union members, have responsibility and obligation to secure our external borders and to respond in an adequate way to the situation that has been changing quickly. Coordination is a key word here. I came to BiH with that same message. The European Union is at your disposal to provide assistance in stabilizing the situation, including security and humanitarian aspects, which are equally important.
I would like to say a few more words on the second important issue that I want to mention. This month we are marking the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement. BiH has lived for too long in the Dayton's shadow. I would like to support the efforts invested by BiH in the sense of progressing along the European path and achieving the European future for all your citizens. It is of key importance that we continue to invest great efforts aimed at these positive changes. Indeed, there are a certain number of challenges ahead of us, and these challenges should be addressed. However, the current momentum must be maintained, it must be used for the benefit of this country in order to ensure that BiH can achieve progress and, finally, leave that past behind.
Mr Chairman, the European Union will continue to support BiH in her efforts. Also, I will personally continue to support BiH. I strongly believe that there is no other alternative for BiH, and that the European future is the only alternative for this country."
68517,Speech delivered by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the Srebrenica 2015 Investment and Development Conference - Development Possibilities and Perspectives for the Municipality of Srebrenica,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=68517&langTag=en-US,2015-11-11,"My esteemed colleague Ivanić, your excellences, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends! It is my pleasure to greet you at the beginning of this very important “Srebrenica 2015“ Investment and Development Conference.
In particular, I would like to greet the Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić. It is with great pleasure that I also greet Rafet Husović, Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, Dr. Denis Zvizdić, Chairperson of the Council of Ministers of BiH, officials from the Republika Srpska entity, President Milorad Dodik and Prime Minister Željka Cvijanović, as well as the entity ministers and other officials who are present here.
I would like to express my sincere respect and appreciation to the ambassadors of our friendly countries and international organizations for everything they have done for our country, who are also with us today, as well as numerous investors and businessmen. Your presence, as well as the support you have provided to Srebrenica, mean a lot to us.
I am grateful to a diligent team of organizers of this investment and development conference, led by Mayor Ćamil Duraković. It is thanks to their proactive engagement that investors, businessmen and politicians have met today in Srebrenica, with the intention to turn this environment into an investment-friendly destination, and a place for a better life.
Srebrenica and the Central Podrinje Region were an arena of fierce conflicts a few decades ago, resulting in a high number of crimes committed, and, ultimately, with a genocide committed against the Bosniaks, in which over eight thousand men were killed.
First connotations to Srebrenica include the war, funerals, commemorative events, the graves. That is why the interest of investors in Srebrenica has been insufficient, and the lives of its citizens has been hard.
It is our obligation to keep changing that image, and that is why we have gathered here today. The times we live in are turbulent, burdened by crises and challenges. However, the composition of today's event bears witness to our readiness to, through shared working and good neighbourly relations, in good faith, solve all difficulties and develop investment-friendly prerequisites in this town.
It is by this conference that we should open a new chapter in the life of Srebrenica and its people, as well as ensure satisfaction and benefit for all by enhancing positive trends in our relations with Serbia and other countries in the region to overall satisfaction and benefit of all.
We wish life to return to Srebrenica, we wish to meet young married couples with children here, who, like generations before them used to, walk smiling through the town; we wish to see satisfied people who will realize their dreams in this town and have successful business and family lives.
I am sure that we can achieve this if we use advantages we have, as well as opportunities ahead. Most important, albeit insufficiently used advantage, includes natural resources this municipality has on its disposal. In particular, mineral resources (copper, zinc, silver, bauxite, gold, decorative stone), forest resources, mineral and therapeutic waters (i.e. veliki guber, sinusna voda, očna voda, ljepotica, kožna voda, mali guber – kinds of therapeutic water available which heal various diseases), natural resources favourable for development of agriculture, and the very important cultural and historical heritage.
Srebrenica and the Central Podrinje Region have got all necessary prerequisites to become economically attractive to serious business and to serious investors.
Some investors have recognised the potential of this area, and have already invested in it. Today and tomorrow we will hear about their positive experiences. I extend gratitude to them, and invite them to continue strengthening the capacities.
I hope that their experience will help businessmen, domestic and foreign alike, to recognize opportunities to increase their capital by investing to Srebrenica, while generating jobs, encouraging the economic development of Srebrenica and the region, and ensuring that the citizens of these areas have access to dignified life.
We, politicians, will be their true supporters in such effort.
I wish you to spend pleasant days in Srebrenica, to reaffirm old and make new friendships during this conference, and to create as many successful business stories as possible. It is my wish that you return to Srebrenica as often as possible, and to always be satisfied on departure.
Do invest in Srebrenica, the now is the right time to do so!"
68170,"Speech by BiH Presidency Chairperson Dragan Čović at the opening of the 11th World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=68170&langTag=en-US,2015-11-03,"Excellences, ladies and gentlemen! Sustainable development meets the needs of the present, while not jeopardizing needs of the next generations. Sustainable development achieves balance between calls for an enhanced quality of life, provision of social benefit and peace for all, and calls for protection of environmental components of natural wealth that both current and future generations depend on.
Respecting the principles of democracy, gender equality, social justice and solidarity, legality, the rights of man, protection of natural wealth, cultural heritage and environment contribute to protecting the Earth in order to sustain life in all its diversity. In this way sustainable development has been achieved by dynamic economy with full employment, economic, social and territorial connectedness, high educational level of citizens, as well as by protection of health and environment.
Sustainable development presupposes achievement of three general goals: stable economic development, fair distribution of social capabilities, and environmental protection. It also brings about changing the whole concept within which we operate, and, moreover, changing ourselves, too. Institutional framework and public services must ensure preconditions for this and plan for such strategy and development that are based on principles of sustainability, i.e. less focus on maximum profit, and more on community and environmental benefit. There will be no change without efforts invested by each individual. Furthermore, what is essential is mutual cooperation.
We have witnessed massive inequality in the world. The 2% of the rich use 85% of resources, while they produce 90% of waste. That is why it is always important to discuss sustainable development. Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development UN General Assembly Resolution, adopted on 25 September this year, as an action plan for people, planet and prosperity, was made in the spirit of continued importance of discussing sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda also aims to strengthen global peace and eliminate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, as most serious global challenge and irreplacable precondition for sustainable development.
17 sustainable development goals and their 169 associated targets indicate the scope and ambition of this new universal agenda. They constitute integreated and indivisible balance of the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and ecological, while, at the same time, they take into account different national realities, capacities and levels of development, and respect national policies and prioities of each country concerned. In addition to the environmental balance, this presupposes both economic stability and social justice.
Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot, by any means, be viewed outside the global trends. It has often been the experience of this country that global trends have followed her, and drasticaly impacted all her internal and external spheres of life and work, even when she has not followed such trends herself.
Sustainable development, as one of the objectives of the strategic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, refers to development of environment and of the environmental infrastructure, of energy and renewable energy resources, transport infrastructure and telecommunications, and development of agriculture and rural areas aimed at diversification of economic activities.
Key challenges to enhancement of sustainable deveopment, which need to be addressed, are:
· globalization and global financial and economic crisis
· climate changes – vulnerability of Bosnia and Herzegovina to floods, droughts, and other extreme events
· rapid decrease of non-renewable energy resources and increase of energy costs
· position of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the region (i.e. in the regions it belongs to) and cooperation with her neighbours
One of the consequences of the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is emigration of highly skilled labour force, which has strongly affected the country's developement. The World Bank estimates that the percentage of highly educated emigrants from BiH amounts to 28.6%. There is not precise data on “brain drain“ from the county, but, as an illustration of its scope, it can be mentioned that 79% of engineers and researchers in the area of technical sciences – 81% of MA degree holders and 75% of PhD degree holders, left Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nowadays, professors, researchers and experts of BiH origin, ready to help BiH through some form of temporary arrangement, work at European and American universities and at leading global companies.
Moreover, around 260,000 children of primary and secondary school age also left the country during the war. Many of them, in addition to the new generations, obtained tertiary education in the meantime.
Therefore, all of us together must work more and better in order to create new forces capable of implementing necessary and agreed changes in the country because progressing towards sustainable development is a social choice made by individuals and families, communities, civil society associations and organizations, as well as by executive and legislative authorities. For the very reason that it includes a possibility of choice making, change is possible only if based on wide inclusion of both the wider public and decision makers as the process concerned is a two-direction road.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, pursuant to her firm commitments, wishes to join the European Union and, therefore, has attempted, by her development policy, to enhance as much as possible the competitiveness of her economy. By doing so, she has aimed to fulfill the economic condition for becoming a member of the EU society.
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are set as the main pillar of the European Union's economic system. SMEs constitute 60% of employment in the private sector, while, in some economic areas (e.g. metal processing sector, civil construction, furniture production), SMEs employ as many as over 80% of labour force.
Comparison between the current policies of enterpreneurship development in BiH and the five strategic areas the European Commission operates within, implies the following key challenges in the next mid-term period:
· enhancing entepreneurship-focused thinking;
· encouraging people to become enterpreneurs;
· supporting enterpreneurs to become more competitive;
· improving financial flows directed to enterprises in order to enable them to maintain their solvency;
· creating a better regulatory and administrative environment for small and medium enterprises.
Enhancing shared economic space and inclusiveness into regional markets and in the European Union market opens up possibilities, previously unthought of, for economic and social development in Bosnia and Herzegovina and for overcoming problems of apsorption capacity of a very small domestic market with inferior solvency margins.
At the same time, the term “shared economic space“ should not be exclusively linked to the arrangement of the interior space in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Exactly to the contrary, accepting the EU rules and standards, and including Bosnia and Herzegovina in the wider regional and EU market, will mean that the problem of creating a shared economic space is definitely solved, regardless if the internal space of Bosnia and Herzegovina is viewed on its own, or if her position is viewed in the wider regional integrations, and in the European Union itself.
Key political, social, technological and environmental factors that affect international competitiveness of Bosnia and Herzegovina, her macrostability, EU path, and, thus, her capability for sustainable development and employment generation are:
· changing demographic picture of both Europe and Bosnia and Herzegovina: ageing of the population, increased life expectancy, lower birth rates with strong impacts on pension and health systems, circulation of educated people to countries which are economically more powerful
· climate changes and constantly increasing imporance of renewable energy resources
· enhanced international competitiveness in the long-term, as a result of the increased economic globalization, and the “middle-income trap“ as a threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina and countries at the same level of development as BiH
· enhancing the role of innovation and research activities, which have become the central element of economic development
· global financial and economic recession with its consequences to economic partners of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to Bosnia and Herzegovina herself
· unstable prices of energy sources and food at the global market.
Experience of the European countries has indicated that employment generation is an irreplacable path leading to a modern society. The features of employment generation are:
· enterpreneurship reflected in creating as many small and medium enterprises as possible, and restructuring of the current enterprises, aimed at including as many people as possible who will be enabled to actively affect their destiny, and
· new approach to regional and local development, which is primarily relying on one's own strengths.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite relatively big problems she has had in the previous years, has preserved, to a high extent, her geo and bio diversity, which can be used as solid foundation for her sustainalble development. Adoption of the EU acquis communautaire in the near future should be done in the function of sustainable development, and it should not represent a burden to the economy, i.e. her competitiveness should be strengthened and not weakened. The area which can contribute most to sustainable development is an increased efficiency of energy usage.
Furthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina has significant land area, almost an ideal climate, and processing industry developed to a significant extent, so that agriculture can strongly service her own food market, while she can export her food.
However, there is a number of challenges at that path. Economic globalization has made state borders more and more relative and given opportunities to capable enterpreneurs, while the role of state public administrations is to contribute, through their activities, to increased competitiveness and capabilities of enterpreneurs in the territory which is as large as possible.
Sustainability has become an art of making a right choice within the existing frameworks, which are not ideal. Sustainability is not a “fixed condition of harmony“. This is the leading idea for the 21st century. Namely, in the centre of its concensus, this idea accepts the following three dimensions: environmental, economic and social, which must be viewed with the same level of respect within local, regional and national strategies of sustainable development, as well as within international agreements achieved in the framework of global governance, aimed at ensuring sustainable development.
It is obvious that Bosnia and Herzegovina has been faced with a challenging path leading to her achievement of sustainable development goals, which are necessary for future generations, and a path leading to creating her legal and economic system in accordance with the EU standards and regulations. However, this is the only possible approach on the path of becoming a full member of the Union, and of becoming competitive to other countries in the region in terms of enterpreneurship and development. In order to overcome obstacles on her path and advance through the process of accession, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to accept all her differencies and specific features, as well as her own constitutional structure, and use to a maximum extent the capable and healthy human potential in the society, such potential that is willing to move the country forward, in order to ensure joy and satisfaction for the next generations, who will follow after us.
Thank you."
66535,"Adress by dr. Mladen Ivanić, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina June Session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Strasbourg, June 24, 2015",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=66535&langTag=en-US,2015-06-24,"Dear Madame President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; First of all, please allow me to express my gratitude for the opportunity to address you today. I am actually accustomed to call you my colleagues, since less than a year ago, I was one of the parliamentarians myself. I had the privilege to meet and befriend many of you, exchange opinions, discuss current events, and even share common fears. These friendships I will keep for the rest of my life.
I had an honour to serve as one of the acting vice presidents of this Assembly. Today, I address you as the Chairman of the Presidency of the Country chairing the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for the first time in its history.
You are directly elected representatives of 800 million citizens across the lands stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Northern Sea to the Mediterranean. It’s a position of prestige, but of immense responsibility as well.
We started our Chairmanship a little over month ago determined to perform our duties with the utmost responsibility and dedication. We cannot promise to be the best Chairmanship ever, but we can promise to do the best we can.
Please allow me to tell you a few words about the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Naturally, it is not ideal and there is still a lot to be done.
The Chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is also an opportunity to underline the great progress the Region of South East Europe has achieved over the past two decades, most notably, the establishment of the friendly and well-coordinated cooperation between our countries, accession of Slovenia and Croatia to the EU, and the dedication of the rest of the region to follow in their footsteps.
Twenty years ago one could hardly have imagined that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia would simultaneously chair the two most important European organizations in the field of Security, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. However, that is the reality of today. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia not only chair Council of Europe and OSCE, but have a close and straightforward coordination of their activities, all in order to have the best possible response to the emerging crisis our continent is faced with today.
Mrs. President, ladies and gentlemen members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe,
Sixty years ago founders of the Council of Europe found the courage and wisdom to build, here in Strasbourg on the ruins of the old Europe, the foundation of this organization, built to ensure the peace, stability, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law for all.
Unfortunately, the latest dramatic events, namely the terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe, humanitarian disaster in the Mediterranean, fragile truce in Ukraine remind us all that security, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law can never be, nor should be taken for granted.
The principles Council of Europe is built upon are confronted today with one of the most serious crisis, threatening to shatter the peace and stability on our Continent.
The question is what to do and how to overcome this crisis?
I am of the opinion that the last Secretary General's Report on State of Democratic Security in Europe can give us a part of an answer:
· Full commitment of the member states to fully respect the conventions and values of this organization;
· The use of exceptional know-how and so called soft power of the Council of Europe in order to intensify the struggle against hatred, intolerance, and radicalism;
· The full commitment by the member states to ensure that democracy, human rights, and the rule of law becomes the integral part of the European security system.
With that in mind I wish to express my support for the recently adopted Action Plan to fight the radicalism and terrorism by the Committee of Ministers, as well as the adoption of Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on prevention of terrorism relating to the issue of foreign fighters.
We are all concerned about the fact that many young Europeans, both men and women are joining terrorist organizations, most notably in Syria and Iraq. These people are numbered in thousands, which is a disturbing thought.
Therefore, I wish to use this opportunity to invite all member states to sign this additional protocol as soon as possible. It is my strong belief that this protocol should be open for signatures in the following months.
Problems we face today transgress the international borders, meaning they cannot be solved by countries individually. Only by working together, the member states of the Council of Europe in close cooperation with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Committee of Ministers and the Congress can successfully tackle these challenges.
The Assembly, as the direct representative of 800 million of our citizens has a very important role to make.
Your activity in the establishment of the Alliance of Parliamentarians against the hate speech, as well as your recent debates on the problem of discrimination in Europe, on radicalism and terrorism, cybercrime, refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, and the decision to establish the status of the partner for democracy for the parliamentary delegations from the neighbouring region confirm your political wisdom and sense of momentum to react timely.
Since its foundation, the Council of Europe has amassed its magnificent system of conventions, covering practically all walks of life. With the European Court of Human Rights and the unique system of monitoring the implementation of its judgements, our organization has positioned itself as a global reference in the domain of human rights. At this point; please let me express our desire to see European Union soon resolve its procedural difficulties in order to become a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Our commission for democracy through law, THE VENICE COMMISSION is renowned international authority in a domain of constitutional law, and its recommendations are sought after and applied even outside of the Council of Europe.
Over the past two decades, Europe has experienced huge political and institutional shifts. Despite of these changes, the Council of Europe with its three main pillars of activities- Human rights, democracy, and the rule of law- continue to have an important impact on the institutional architecture of our continent. Of course, it needs regularly to adopt itself to the circumstances of the given era and events, and remain open for new ideas and cooperation with other European and International organizations.
Today, seventy six years after the inception of the Council of Europe, the threats to peace and stability may have taken a different form, but the answer remains the same: democracy, human rights, the rule of law, respect for others, and those who are different.
Let us use wisely the capital our predecessors have built over the last seven decades in our best interests and the interests of the future generations.
Thank you very much."
67415,Speech delivered by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at Central British manifestation for marking the 20th anniversary of genocide in Srebrenica at Westminister Abbey in London,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=67415&langTag=en-US,2015-06-07,"I have joined you today at Westminster Abbey at this solemn marking of the Memorial Day on the occassion of the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.
Excellences,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear friends!
I have joined you today at Westminster Abbey at this solemn marking of the Memorial Day on the occassion of the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.
We have gathered here in order to remember the 8,372 Bosniak men and boys of Islamic faith, who were killed in Srebrenica twenty years ago, and to pay our respects to thousands of genocide survivors, who have had to continue their lives with a lasting heritage of tragedy.
We have gathered here in order to try to understand and look back at what happened in Srebrenica, to learn the lesson about the genocide, and understand its consequences.
Global public condemnation of genocide will help in ensuring that such evil acts never occur again.
Being the first one in Europe and in the world to do so, Great Britain has organised a commemoration on the Srebrenica genocide, and promoted the truth on what happened there. Also, she has been the first one to have initiated education on genocide in order to ensure that the whole world gets familiar with this tragic event.
The United Kingdom is the only country in the word which proclaimed Srebrenica Remembrance Day.
On the occassion of the Srebrenica genocide anniversary, around 200 events will take place this year in various towns throughout Great Britain.
I am very pleased that “Remembering Srebrenica“ Foundation, funded by the Government of the United Kingdom, has planned to establish the first permanent global Memorial Centre “Srebrenica“, which will provide educational support to struggle against hatred and intolerance by means of leadership and commemoration networks, learning and educational activities.
We deeply appreciate the people and the Government of the United Kingdom for their support to genocide survivors – through funding provided for the Memorial Centre building in Srebrenica and the International Commission on Missing Persons, as well as for their support programmes for returnees to Srebrenica.
The British Government and the Prime Minister Cameroon personally took an unequivocal stance that the genocide in Srebrenica must not be forgotten, and that lessons, which must also be applied by the international community, must be learned from that tragic event.
I hereby extend my welcome to the efforts invested by Great Britain in launching and drafting the UN Security Council resolution in order to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica.
I strongly support this resolution because it marks the anniversary with due respect and pays tribute to the victims in a discrete way, while demonstrating solidarity with the survivors, and reminding the world of the appaling consequences based on the lack of reaction in the eve of the genocide.
This resolution should reaffirm and strengthen determination of the United Nations to prevent repetition of such atrocities in the light of the lesson learned on the Srebrenica genocide.
Pursuant to the Security Council Resolution 819, adopted on 16 April 1993, Srebrenica was declared a UN “safe haven“ and it was established that it should be defended by all United Nations Member States “by all necessary means, including the use of force“.
None the less, between 11 and 16 July 1995, the death squads led by Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić executed 8,372 Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica.
Tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly deported.
Families and communities got devastated.
Despite of their obligation to protect the civilian population of srebrenica, the United Nations failed to prevent the genocide.
Srebrenica - the UN “safe haven“ thus turned into the United Nations' darkest hour.
In his report on the fall of Srebrenica, submitted in 2000, Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations states that “through error, misjudgement and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, the United Nations failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica“.
This was the worst crime committed on the European soil after the Second World War.
Therefore, it is most appropriate and historically relevant that the United Nations Security Council holds a commemoration on the Srebrenica genocide, and pays tribute to the victims and survivors by adopting the resolution submitted by Great Britain, so that I am hereby inviting all Security Council members to vote in favour of this resolution tomorrow.
The best way for us to pay tribute to the Srebrenica genocide victims would be to learn lessons on the UN failure, and ensure that the same mistakes are made never again.
Unfortunately, it seems to me that this has not been done.
Contrary to frequent promises that lessons were learned from the tragedy in Srebrenica, so many times in the last twenty years we have witnessed unreadiness of the international community to act decisively in order to stop massacre of civilians elsewhere in the world, particularly when such action implied any risk, burden or price.
The international community opted a number of times for such policy which had failed in Bosnia.
Why do we have to keep learning the same lessons over and over again?
The UN General Assembly and Security Council determined in 2005 that they would accept responsibility to protect civilian population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
However, the responsibility to protect civilian population turned out to be more of a declaratory principle than an obligatory rule for any international action.
We must be more cautious in detecting and responding to early warning indicators on potential genocide, particularly to ethnic and racial intolerance, hatred, discrimination and marginalization.
Dear friends, diversity is a distinctive feature of human beings.
Our human race is a mosaic composed of rich amalgam of peoples, cultures and religions that blend into a dynamic and diverse bond.
It is our responsibility to preserve and protect that mosaic.
Historical experience in Bosnia has offered valuable lessons in that regard.
The unique multiethnic culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been woven for one thousand years of tolerance and respect among her citizens, regardless of their ethnic or religious affiliation.
The intention of those who committed the genocide was to destroy the multiethnic tissue of our society by means of mass slaughter, torture, rape, expulsion and looting.
Such intention culminated in Srebrenica in July 1995.
There is an ongoing struggle in Bosnia today between those who have striven to revive the pluralist character and tolerant spirit of our society, and those who have worked on strengthening and deepening ethnic divisions caused by force and crimes.
To fail to abolish the consequences of indescribable crimes which ripped up our society would certainly be a reward for those who committed them, whereas, at the same time, such failure would send a dangerous message to all those who would be willing to commit genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes in the future – that such crimes would, ultimately, be profitable or worth committing.
Regardless of this, we in Bosnia, who firmly believe that cultural pluralism is most valuable treasure of humanity, will continue to invest efforts aimed at restoring our pluralist society and laying down the such foundations that will enable the future generations to overcome divisions.
Reconciliation and restoration of our society are crucial, albeit most difficult tasks we have been facing because remains of our recent past, particularly of the genocide-ideology, have not ceased to impede our progress.
Both physical and emotional wounds of our population, caused by the crimes committed during the war, have made our progress to true reconciliation a difficult and painful process.
Both ideological and political followers of those who were the main organisers of the genocide have obstructed our progress to achiving full stability, prosperity and membership in the European Union and NATO.
They publicly denied the Srebrenica genocide, despite the judgement passed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which confirmed that what was committed in Srebrenica was an act of genocide, and the judgement passed by the International Court of Justice, which concluded that the acts committed in Srebrenica contained all distinctive features of genocide.
They still keep dreaming about finalizing the political project of Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, which turned out to be catastrophic for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole region.
Almost daily, they have threatened to tear off the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina from which hundreds of thousands of non-Serb civilians were either expelled or killed.
Of course, they will not succeed because we will never allow that Srebrenica, Prijedor, Zvornik and many other arenas where horrific crimes were committed get separated from Bosnia.
We must confront this dangerous and irresponsible adventurism by means of strangthening our collective decisiveness to prevent inflicting new wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Those who wish to have better relations with BiH, and with Bosnia, will have to accept the past, face the truth, stop questioning souvereignity and territorial integrity of our country, stop insulting the victims and genocide survivors, and stop denying historical facts confirmed by the courts.
These issues are not debatable. We can try to reach mutually beneficial agreements through dialogue and compromise on any other issues.
The truth on the Srebrenica genocide cannot be the subject of political negotiations, compromise, or of some arbitrary solution that is acceptable for all sides.
We strongly reject the stance that remembering and commemorating the genocide would deepen divisions in our society and have negative impact on stability in Bosnia. Indispensable prerequsitites for stability are the truth on each crime, regardless of who perpetrators and victims were respectively, and accepting such truth by all sides.
The only way in which reconciliation can be achieved is that it is based on truth and justice. The process of reconciliation cannot advance unless there is a shared recognition that the crime was committed.
Regardless of everything, the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be stopped.
The vast majority of our citizens wish peace, stability and prosperity, wish to build shared and safe future for themselves and their children.
Time works to the advantage of those who love our country, who have contributed to her progress, and who wish to see her as a safe and prosperous one - as a member of the European Union and NATO.
Gradually, Bosnia will return to her usual self – the place where people of different religions, cultures and identities live together in harmony, safety and progress,
Today, at Westminster Abbey, we can see these 20 candles lit on the occassion of marking the 20th anniversary of the genocide – each marking a year of pain and denial since the genocide took place.
We cannot bring back the dead, nor extinguish pain from the hearts of their loved ones.
What we can do is ensure dignity and justice to the survivors of the Srebrenica genocide, to those who lived through terrible pain and suffering.
We owe this not only to the dead and to the survivors, but also to ourselves, to humanity that each one of us holds within, and to the future generations, who do not deserve to bear the burden of their fathers' sin."
66083,Media statements by BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Mladen Ivanić and President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=66083&langTag=en-US,2015-05-20,"On behalf of the Presidency and in my own name I wish to express a true pleasure that we have an opportunity today to welcome President of the Republic of Turkey Mr Erdoğan here in Sarajevo, a man who knows Bosnia and Herzegovina well, a man who has been present for a long time, and as a man who is the leader of the country which has invested much in Bosnia and Herzegovina and which has been truly assisting the country.
BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Mladen Ivanić
Good afternoon all!
On behalf of the Presidency and in my own name I wish to express true pleasure that we have an opportunity today to welcome President of the Republic of Turkey Mr Erdoğan here in Sarajevo, a man who knows Bosnia and Herzegovina well, a man who has been present for a long time, and as a man who is the leader of the country which has invested much in Bosnia and Herzegovina and which has been truly assisting the country.
Relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey are very good and friendly. We are grateful for the projects (over 700 projects, nearly 300 million Convertible Marks worth of reconstruction projects) which their agency TIKA has conducted, the agency which has really done much here in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An already high level of economic cooperation has been increasing, where Bosnia and Herzegovina has increased its exports significantly, especially last year. Those were the topics we devoted most of our attention to today; the economy: investments, increase of mutual exchange and creation of conditions for people, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to have a better standard of living.
We are very grateful to Turkey for opening the import quota for meat from Bosnia and Herzegovina and we hope that the long term agreement will lead to increased production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that we will reach the capacity of 10,000 tons per annum, which would represent an extremely significant progress for our agriculture.
Today we also, naturally, discussed the export of milk, taking into account that milk producers in BiH have been facing great difficulties lately, especially after Croatia joined the EU.
We discussed many other aspects of mutual cooperation and I can freely say that there is no disagreement between us. We also share a joint stance on international affairs, and share a joint interest in fight against terrorism, and let me go back on the previous topic again, we are particularly grateful to President Erdoğan for including in his delegation today a large number of ministers, as well as a great number of renown business persons – people who are ready to invest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, people who wish to invest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we shall touch upon these topics in meetings later today.
It is a true pleasure to discuss and exchange information regarding the question of terrorism in the presence of such a high delegation. It is our mutual wish to jointly contribute to fight against terrorism, noting that Turkey perhaps at this moment is more exposed to it than we are.
I hope that today's visit will be very successful, and that the greatest effects of the visit today will be felt by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that there will be opening of new work places after this visit, as well as the increase of mutual exchange and even better understanding between our peoples.
Once again, on behalf of the Presidency, I wish to express a warm welcome to Mr Erdoğan and his whole team here in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Welcome!
President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
Respected President!
Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Dear guests!
Primarily the visit which we have realised in Bosnia and Herzegovina is of great importance to us, and I wish to say thank you in my own name, and on behalf of my delegation, to all those who have welcomed us here.
This visit is of great significance and it will contribute to a rapid development of relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey. This will be a process which will develop our cooperation. The scope of trade between Turkey and BiH is around 500 million, but we believe that this level is not sufficient and we wish to increase mutual investments in import export. Our delegations discussed this topic. My ministers and I have made the necessary notes and after detailed talks which we will hold today accompanied by the businessmen who are part of our delegation, we will make concrete steps in all fields, particularly in the field of military, culture, politics and tourism. We wish to achieve concrete agreements and cooperation in the field of military industry between Turkey and BiH.
The support of Turkey to Bosnia and Herzegovina for membership to NATO Alliance continues. We shall not make any concessions. Besides, our support in the political field of EU integrations continues, and it will continue to show through numerous investments. Likewise, as you already know, in the period when I worked as the Prime Minister, I promised that we will grant a 100 million EUR credit. Most of this has already been used, and now we have ensured another 50 million EUR credit to small and medium sized enterprises. Naturally, the most important step in this respect will be made by the Turkish Ziraat Bank and these investments by the Turkish Ziraat Bank are an example of why Turkey is today a country which is on the list of top countries investing most in BiH. Likewise, we are currently importing large quantities of meat from BiH. Currently that import is at the maximum level. This is of great importance for me, because the import which amounted to 3 million dollars in 2012 has been increased to 80 million dollars. This best shows how important we consider this topic to be, and how determined we are regarding this question. This has contributed to a decrease in the deficit in the scope of trade relations between the two countries. We also wish to decrease the existing deficit in import export. Turkish agency TIKA has realised over 700 projects and continues with its work. The president of TIKA is present here today. We will continue with these investments in the next period, wishing to contribute to cultural heritage in Bosnia and Herzegovina, believing that Bosnia and Herzegovina can become a large, attractive destination in the field of tourism.
The same goes for the field of military industry. Bosnia and Herzegovina has great experience in this industry. We can accomplish great cooperation here. Similarly, we can have cooperation in the field of reserve automobile parts. We shall discuss this in more detail.
Bosnia and Herzegovina possesses a great wealth of forests. The sector of furniture and other products can be of great importance. We have some existing investments in this sector by Turkish investors, and we wish to strengthen this cooperation in the period ahead.
Furthermore, Turkish companies can make a greater contribution to the building of infrastructure and infrastructural projects, for example, we can work on the enlargement of the Sarajevo Airport, which would present a great advantage to BiH. It is for all these reasons that this visit has been very constructive in the field of cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey. This solidarity and cooperation we have will continue in the future. I absolutely believe in that, because all these representatives who have been chosen to be part of my delegation, who are here today, they will investigate in detail and with determination what can be done in which field. I thank you for the hospitality you have shown.
Thank you."
65240,Addresses by BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Mladen Ivanić and the President of the Republic of Croatia Kolinda Grabar Kitarović,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=65240&langTag=en-US,2015-03-03,"BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Mladen Ivanić:
It is my true pleasure today to, on behalf of BiH Presidency, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in my own name, I can welcome, together with other members of the Presidency of BiH, President of the Republic of Croatia Mrs Grabar Kitarović here in Sarajevo.
The Republic of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are two truly friendly states which share a long border, and Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a true friend in Croatia which has always been of assistance.
I believe we had very honest and open meetings today, and I am pleased that the President of the Republic of Croatia chose Bosnia and Herzegovina for her first official visit. This shows the significance Bosnia and Herzegovina has for the Republic of Croatia, but also the significance the Republic of Croatia has for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are very grateful for a strong support which we have from Croatia on our path towards the European Union and Brussels, as well as a very strong personal support from Mrs Grabar Kitarović which we had also had during her term as a foreign minister, and now when she is the President of Croatia. We are more than grateful for that. We are also grateful for the fact that this last, new European initiative has practically in a way had its roots in the initiatives coming from the Republic of Croatia.
I think we can be optimistic about the period ahead and our successful cooperation in the years to come.
It is my true pleasure to be her host today in Sarajevo.
Thank you.
President of the Republic of Croatia Kolinda Grabar Kitarović:
Good afternoon all.
It is really lovely and very pleasant to be in Sarajevo today.
I thank, before all, BiH Presidency Chairman Mr Ivanić and dear friend Mladen, as well as other Presidency members Mr Izetbegović and Mr Čović for their hospitality today.
As you know, we arrived to Sarajevo today by car, because I wanted to show how close Zagreb and Sarajevo are. The goal of my visit today is to send a message of friendship, good-neighbourly relations, and cooperation between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The basis of my relationship towards Bosnia and Herzegovina is the absolute respect of its sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Equally, the respect of a total constituent and equal status of all three peoples – Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, bearing in mind and respecting the rights of citizens who do not belong to none of those three peoples.
I have personally always advocated and will continue to advocate for the European and Euro-Atlantic path of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and will do all in my power to further, on behalf of the Republic of Croatia as well as personally, continue keep the attention of the international community and the European Union, the USA and NATO to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Naturally, I welcome the British-German initiative which has grown into the European initiative, and which has its roots in the Croatian initiative. I also welcome all activities of High Representative Mogherini and all she does on implementation of that initiative and I can, without hesitation, say that the Republic of Croatia will be at BiH disposal, with its political support on the path towards European and Euro-Atlantic integrations, but likewise, with concrete assistance in regards to institution building reforms and everything else which awaits Bosnia and Herzegovina on that rather long and complicated path.
Therefore, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are and will remain friendly states. We shall continue to talk about all issues, including open questions which were not high on the agenda today, because I wish for this first visit to be the message of friendship and openness to every conversation and every discussion.
I am delighted with the atmosphere I see here, the atmosphere of cooperation between the members of the Presidency, and I really wish for the government to be formed at all levels at soonest, so that the reform path of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which I particularly encourage, can be continued. And I repeat one more time; Croatia is available for any kind of assistance.
Croatia is especially interested in economic cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, we plan to discuss the cross-border initiatives which are of equal benefit to both states and all peoples, within the European Union."
63646,Speech by the BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović at the Crans Montana Forum award ceremony,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=63646&langTag=en-US,2014-10-17,"Since I was elected a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2010, I have done my best to promote reconciliation, reintegration, and rebuilding of trust in my country. I have worked hard to advance the European integration of my country and to foster dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding in the Western Balkans as a whole.
Ambassador Carteron,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am deeply grateful to the Crans Montana Forum for awarding me the PRIX DE LA FONDATION 2014.
It is a rare and special honor.
And I accept it with profound gratitude.
Since I was elected a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2010, I have done my best to promote reconciliation, reintegration, and rebuilding of trust in my country.
I have worked hard to advance the European integration of my country and to foster dialogue, cooperation and mutual understanding in the Western Balkans as a whole.
I regard this award as an important recognition of my efforts, but also as an obligation to continue the work I have been doing over the past four years.
It is a remarkable privilege to be chosen for this award, especially taking into account the impressive list of the past winners.
This award also has a profound personal meaning to me.
The President of Switzerland personally presented this very award to my late father Alija Izetbegović.
So being here today brings back memories.
My father led our nation during the most difficult time in our history.
We have gone a long way since.
In fact, I believe we have traveled the longer and the more difficult half of the journey.
Ahead of us now is the task of completing the democratic development of our country.
And ensuring that future generations live in a secure and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Over the past two decades, we have made a tremendous investment in building peace and stability in Bosnia, and in the Western Balkans as a whole.
We must preserve and consolidate this achievement, so that our region can continue to stride towards prosperity.
But we also must remain keenly aware of the underlying tensions and dangerous undercurrents that have existed throughout our history.
Such as extremism, domination, exclusion, mistrust, fear of the other.
When allowed to surface and gain in strength, these undercurrents can give rise to new divisions, fragmentation, disintegration, and cause instability.
We thus constantly have to seek to discourage them and keep them in check.
Any disintegration trends must be stopped before they can threaten the progress we have achieved.
I am an optimist.
I strongly believe the currents of integration will overpower the relics of the past, freeing the way to a brighter future.
But, we must be willing to constantly learn from our past mistakes.
Too often we have been prisoners of our own mentality.
Some perceive willingness to compromise as a weakness.
But just the opposite is true – compromise requires courage.
We must break out of the worn patterns of the past.
We must correctly interpret and advance the interests of those we represent.
Some politicians too often look for easy, populist solutions, placing personal or political gain above the interests of their people.
We must listen, understand and respect each other more.
Our most important mission in the time to come will be to build bridges of trust, understanding, respect and cooperation.
That is hard work that requires daring leadership.
Those are the values to which I have been and will remain deeply committed in my work.
Those are the pillars of my political vision.
That political vision received a significant support among the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the parliamentary and presidential elections that were held in my country last Sunday.
This is a clear indication that our citizens want Bosnia and Herzegovina integrated into the positive global trends and achievements of the free world.
Dear friends,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small European country.
But Bosnia’s symbolic significance by far exceeds its geographical and geopolitical dimensions.
Bosnia’s historical experience offers valuable lessons.
Going forward, we can benefit from the lessons that my country has learned from constantly seeking to improve its understanding and management of diversity.
Bosnia is a meeting point of civilizations, a bridge between the East and the West.
Bosnia is a focal point around which events and developments in the Western Balkans revolve.
Its unique multiethnic culture has been woven through one thousand years of tolerance and respect among its citizens, regardless of their ethnic and religious affiliation.
That is why its preservation and success, as a specific microcosm, is crucial.
Bosnia needs Europe, the united Europe of stability, prosperity and cooperation.
And Europe needs Bosnia.
Because Europe’s future firmly lies with the very idea that Bosnian citizens have treasured and defended throughout our history – the unity of diversity.
Bosnia has always been a part of Europe.
Yet, Bosnia still remains outside Europe’s common house.
No less than its neighbors, Bosnia has a right to take a seat in that house – beside its fellow Europeans, in the family of European nations, family of freedom and democracy.
Thank you."

Ceremony of signing a “Declaration on the Role of the State in Addressing the Issue of Persons Missing as a Consequence of Armed Conflict and Human Rights Abuses”
Mostar, August 29th, 2014
Dear families of missing persons,
Esteemed presidents Josipović, Nikolić and Vujanović,
Dear ambassador Miller,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear friends!
Our gathering today in Mostar with an aim of signing the “Declaration on the Role of the State in Addressing the Issue of Persons Missing as a Consequence of Armed Conflict and Human Rights Abuses” on the occasion of August 30th, International Day of the Disappeared, is highly important.
I would especially like to emphasize the role and engagement of the International Commission on Missing Persons, whose representatives made a great effort and managed to gather heads of state of our region, in order for us to jointly assume obligations arising from this strategic document.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Achievements that Bosnia and Herzegovina made in the process of finding and identification of missing persons can serve as an example for the rest of the region, even in global framework.
People in my country suffered hardships and atrocities during the war, the consequences of which we still face.
Out of 40.000 missing persons in the region, the greatest number refers to citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
So far, out of 30.000 missing persons that are still searched for, more than 24.000 remains have been found and more than 22.000 persons have been identified, including 6.476 Srebrenica genocide victims.
Unfortunately, more than 8.000 persons are still being declared as missing.
Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Law on missing persons in 2004.
Its adoption stipulates forming the Missing Persons Institute with headquarters in Sarajevo, as the state institution responsible for searching for missing persons.
With the necessary support from the international community, Bosnia and Herzegovina decided to do everything in its power in order to be completely at disposal of families who are searching for their dearest.
It is a heinous crime to hide the remains of the victims.
The crime is also not allowing them to be buried with dignity, to mark their resting place in proper manner.
Many victims were found through work of entity commissions for missing persons, and later, Missing Persons Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are aware of the threat that a number of missing persons will never be found.
However, we will not give up for as long as there is hope for finding and identification of the last victim.
Hence, from this place, I call on all those who have information on missing persons, mass and individual graves, to cooperate with international and domestic institutions.
It is an act of humanity and debt to victims and their families who have searched for their dearest for decades.
It is not easy to talk about thousands of people with their tragic destinies.
All of those who were killed had their lives, their dreams, their joys and sorrows.
They had a name and a surname, people who loved them, families and friends.
I have visited many mass graves and attended numerous funerals of identified victims.
We are consternated, over and over again, by the proportion of committed crimes.
Although their pain is permanent, those who bury their murdered relatives following decades of searching are seeking justice rather than revenge.
It is the satisfaction they must get before the courts of our country or International Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
For these crimes do not have statute of limitation.
The whole world was appalled by tragic examples of inexplicable evil, such as Tomašica mass grave in the area of Prijedor.
It took almost twenty years for this mass grave to be discovered, as well as the proportions of multiple systematic brutal attacks on remains of the victims that were dislocated to various sites, in order to conceal the crime.
Unfortunately, not all the mass graves from previous war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region of Balkans have been discovered and exhumed.
Hence it is an imperative civic duty and responsibility to stop the horrible silence that conceals the truth about places like Tomašica for two decades.
We must not let families of missing person be alone until we have found the last victim.
It is only in this ways that we can settle the debt to them and their dearest.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the whole region as well, families of missing persons set example for their devotion and commitment in their humane mission.
More than 90.000 relatives voluntarily gave DNA Reference Samples to the International Commission on Missing Persons, which enabled DNA testing for identification purposes.
We must honour all these family members for persistence they demonstrate.
Along with excruciating pain they suffer, they also often face existential problems, as well as lack of understanding of their surrounding that sometimes wants to avoid painful topics that bring us back into the past.
Owing to engagement of the International Commission on Missing Persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina there has been a great scientific progress in applying forensic genetics in order to identify missing persons, which is an important achievement in global scientific framework.
It is the first organization that utilized the previously mentioned achievement and applied it to solving the cases of missing persons.
Now those achievements are applied worldwide where needed.
Our experts are very successful and esteemed in this field.
Dear friends!
I have mentioned only a few aspects in a difficult, and most of all, delicate process of finding missing persons that are characteristic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I believe that these examples, as well as Declaration that we are signing today, encourage all the other countries in the world to use our experience and pay special attention to this highly important social and humanitarian issue.
Unfortunately, other countries in the modern world, as well as our region, are facing the same or similar problem following the period of conflict.
Hoping for a better and more peaceful world, we have responsibility to draw important lessons for the future from recent tragic events.
All with a clear aim for the future generations to live without painful temptations and traumas that our countries and peoples suffered at the end of the twentieth century.
Thank you!"

We wish to express our most sincere gratitude to your countries, international organizations and financial institutions for the pledges you are going to make today to help us recover and rebuild.
President Nikolić,
Prime Minister Bratušek,
Minister Fabius, Commissioner Fule,
Ministers, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
On behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I wish to express our deepest appreciation to France, Slovenia and the European Commission for taking the initiative to convene this conference. We wish to express our most sincere gratitude to your countries, international organizations and financial institutions for the pledges you are going to make today to help us recover and rebuild.
We are deeply touched by the acts of solidarity your peoples and governments have extended to us over the past two months. I especially thank you for the immediate assistance – including rescue teams, equipment and humanitarian aid – that saved the lives of so many of our citizens.
The natural disaster that struck us did not respect borders. And neither did the response by peoples and governments of the world. In the most difficult hours and days of the disaster, we witnessed moving demonstrations of solidarity and cooperation that crossed all divides inside and outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These acts of solidarity continued well after the water receded. Dealing with the grim aftermath, and the enormous implications of this disaster, requires the same level of cooperation and solidarity that was displayed during the disaster. We are convinced that a rapid recovery will be possible if we rebuild together – as is the motto of this conference, for which we are grateful and hopeful.
I am pleased President Nikolić and I are here together – making a joint appeal for your assistance in rebuilding our countries. Over the past years, we have invested great efforts to achieve better relations and improve our cooperation. As confirmed by the Summit held yesterday in Dubrovnik, cooperation in the Western Balkans has reached a level not seen before.
Today’s conference is a compelling display of our cooperation. This joint appeal to rebuild together makes us ever more determined to continue working hand in hand. We were struck by a natural disaster of catastrophic proportions.We suffered the largest rainfall and the worst flooding in the last 120 years.
The whole of the watershed leading to the river Sava was overwhelmed – generating flash floods that created a path of destruction and desolation. The accumulated downstream flow of water, mud and debris caused widespread floods in the plain.
As the river Sava peaked, drainage from the plain was made impossible – resulting in the retention of water in lowlands for an extended period of time. Water retention by soil and slopes was surpassed – causing several thousand landslides.
More than 80 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered enormous damages, losses, and environmental and social impacts. Almost 100 thousand of our citizens were temporarily displaced from their homes.More than 40 thousand took extended refuge in public or private shelters, or moved in temporarily with relatives or friends.
A large number of them are still without roofs. They will remain displaced until their houses and livelihoods are restored. An urgent response is needed to ensure that they do not face a cold winter without roof or income.
The human dimensions of the disaster are immense. The human stories of loss and desolation are devastating. No quantification can do justice to telling those losses. Everything that so many of our citizens had built their entire lives was destroyed or severely damaged in a matter of hours. Their homes washed away, their agricultural fields and farms destroyed, their livelihoods and future prospects erased.
Within the affected populations, vulnerable groups are affected even harder. Among them are tens of thousands of children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, single parents and Roma. Many of them were already living below the poverty line.Many of the displaced are the same ones who had to leave their homes during the war. Having settled not so long ago, they now find themselves displaced once again.
These vulnerable groups cannot be expected to self-recover. We must give them special attention and priority support to secure their housing, livelihoods, and access to health and education.The total economic impact of the disaster is estimated to have reached 2.1 billion Euros – of which 1.3 billion Euros are damages and 763 million Euros are losses.
This is equivalent to nearly 15 percent of our GDP. Most impacted was the private sector. The hardest hit economic sectors were agriculture, transport and productive activities. The largest physical destruction was in housing and transport infrastructure. The largest cumulative impact with the highest social implications is on livelihoods, employment and productive capacity.
Damages and losses in the agriculture sector alone are over 180 million Euros. There is a risk of a large number of agriculture dependent households to go under the poverty line. In the most severe scenario, around 30 percent of households linked to the agriculture sector could go under the poverty line. The effect that diminished economic activities will have on the youth population – which already has the highest unemployment rate of over 50 percent – will be significant.
Public service facilities and services were severely affected, generating a reduced capacity to provide them to a population that now has increasing needs.
All this creates an amount of need that is financially unmanageable with our current resources and budgets. Our total short-, medium- and long- term recovery and reconstruction needs are estimated at 1.7 billion Euros.
Given the pressure to rapidly resume economic activities and restore homes and livelihoods before the winter, the short-term needs for the next 6 to 12 months amount to 652 million Euros.
The most important resource mobilization in the short term is for housing – repairs and reconstruction to ensure a roof before the winter to those displaced as well as compensation for destroyed or damaged household items. These immediate short-term housing needs are 181 million Euros.
Also very important are immediate repairs in the flood protection infrastructure, pending a major investment to be done in the medium and long term. Going forward, we must ensure an integrated river basin management and climate-resilient flood prevention.This requires an environmentally sound, regional perspective. The coordination and cooperation of the countries in our region that share the river basins is strategically indispensable.
I hope this conference will contribute to increasing operational cooperation on flood protection in the region, as well as, more generally, on natural disaster risk management.Having in mind our existing capacities and available resources, the early recovery period will be essential. Our recovery priorities in the next 6 to 12 months are rebuilding homes, sustaining livelihoods, restoring private sector productive activity and critical public services and facilities, such as schools and hospitals.
The situation in the affected areas is difficult. The challenges we face are complex. The needs are urgent, pressing and multidimensional.Tremendous efforts will be required from our population and government institutions to overcome the disaster’s extensive consequences.
Our government at all levels has already responded to the immediate needs. Many of those needs will remain for the upcoming months, requiring sustained support. We are employing all available domestic financial and material resources to respond to the needs. We are putting in place innovative mechanisms to provide rapid and transparent access to resources for recovery.
We are advancing legislation to compensate the immediate needs, including through solidarity funds. We will provide a base of resources to those funds through our internal efforts – budgetary reallocations and contributions from our citizens. But, that will not be enough. We need international donor support to provide liquidity to those funds.
Our combined recovery and reconstruction needs by far exceed our financial and material resources. Thus we are making this appeal for your assistance and cooperation. We intend to ensure a responsive, reliable, monitored and well-informed recovery process at all levels of our government. Our goal is to meet the post disaster needs of our population in a timely and targeted manner.
We will make all efforts to assure that the financial assistance we receive from donors is used efficiently, transparently and swiftly. Disaster recovery opens the possibility for change of past practices and the opportunity to move forward.
We see the recovery process as an opportunity to advance and accelerate the necessary transformative changes that are needed to achieve prosperity and generate opportunities for our population. We were encouraged by the demonstration of solidarity and cooperation during the emergency response that crossed ethnic and social divides.
This could be a step to the opening of a new social dynamic in our country. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are vital and resilient. We have overcome many disasters in our history. I am sure we will overcome this one as well. We will rebuild together everything this disaster destroyed.
I hope we can count on your assistance to rebuild better together. Our perspective is forward looking. We want to move with a positive outlook to the future.
Our future firmly lies with Europe. We are unanimous in wanting our country to become a European Union member. Timely integration is of critical importance to achieving our desired future. While the primary responsibility for securing that future lies with us in Bosnia, Europe’s active support is essential.
Bosnia has always been a part of Europe. Its citizens have treasured and defended European values throughout its history. Yet, Bosnia remains outside Europe’s common house.
No less than its neighbors, Bosnia has a right to take a seat in that house – beside its fellow Europeans. The situation we find ourselves in requires change of approach – of us in Bosnia and of our friends in Europe. Europe’s decisive engagement at the highest political level through an approach that takes into account Bosnia's specifics is necessary to accelerate our accession to the European Union.
The best approach would be to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate country status and start accession negotiations immediately. All necessary reforms – including the implementation of the judgment of European Court of Human Rights in the case of Sejdić and Finci – should become subject of our accession negotiations under the relevant chapters of the acquis communitaire.
We are fully aware that we must fulfill our obligations. And I assure you that we will! But, let us begin with those obligations that we can fulfill right now, those about which we can achieve internal agreement.
This is flexibility Europe can and should show us. That would be a grand act of Europe’s true solidarity with Bosnia and Herzegovina.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us repair the terrible damage that nature inflicted on our country.
Just as nature can be repaired, so can history.
Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves it.
Thank you."

We highly appreciate the help of British people and Government for surviving victims of Srebrenica genocide. This is noticeable in great contribution to building of Memorial Centre in Potočari, as well as work of International Commission on Missing Persons and also active participation in programs of help for Srebrenica returners.
Esteemed Mr. Azmi,
Dear friends from organization Remembering Srebrenica education initiative,
Thank you for devotedly keeping the memory of genocide victims in Srebrenica with numerous activities.
Your voice is important. It is heard loud and clear across Great Britain and the whole Europe.
We have gathered here to remember with sadness those who were murdered, but also to appreciate those who survived and who are facing the darkness of permanent heritage of committed genocide. We highly appreciate the help of British people and Government for surviving victims of Srebrenica genocide. This is noticeable in great contribution to building of Memorial Centre in Potočari, as well as work of International Commission on Missing Persons and also active participation in programs of help for Srebrenica returners.
I would like to thank British Government and Prime Minister Cameron for their uncompromising attitude that genocide in Srebrenica must not be forgotten. The United Kingdom is the only state in the world that has proclaimed “Srebrenica Memorial Day”. Hopefully we can convince other countries to do the same. We are working together to ensure that next year, on the twentieth anniversary, genocide in Srebrenica is marked in capital cities throughout Europe. Support us in the United Nations, which we expect to proclaim July 11 as “Srebrenica Memorial Day.”
I would especially like to greet four courageous mothers of Srebrenica who are here with us today. Their confessions described us horrors of survived genocide and its consequences they are facing on a daily basis even after 20 years. Srebrenica survivors suffered a lot in many ways. Apart from the fact that they lost their loved ones in a terrible way, many of them experienced physical violence, assaults, offences, struggle for economic survival and psychological traumas that last.
Even after they survived horrors of genocide, after they lost their dearest, after years of pain and sorrow, they still have the strength to send out messages of hope in better world, with more justice. They ask for what belongs to them by laws of God and people- punishment for perpetrators and justice for victims. We are humbled by their courage. Their struggle for justice inspires us. Their determination testifies about unfaltering human spirit.
Mothers of Srebrenica had meetings with their friends in the Government of this country. They asked for Great Britain to work in the UN Security Council so as to proclaim July 11 as Srebrenica Memorial Day in the whole world, they asked for children in schools in Great Britain to learn about genocide committed in the heart of Europe in the 20th century and to prevent something like from ever happening again. Mothers invited the Prime Minister and other friends to visit Srebrenica before the twentieth anniversary of the genocide.
I will work with the Prime Minister and the Government of Great Britain to fulfil their requirements.
Europe must always remember what happened in my country at the end of the twentieth century. However, reminiscence is not enough. World must learn lessons from Srebrenica. It must do everything to make sure that genocide never happens again. Justice will not be done unless the ideology that led to genocide in Srebrenica is defeated. Justice will not be satisfied unless the policy of genocide is eradicated.
Unfortunately, in part of my country called RS genocide is still denied. They are not facing the truth. There is no catharsis necessary to complete the process of reconciliation and building of society where all benevolent people will see better future for themselves and their children. A few days ago, president of RS said in public that Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić are heroes. He said that he respects them and that he will respect them even if they are convicted in the International Criminal Court in The Hague. While we were sending out messages of peace with the sound of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War, iconography of certain nationalist gathering in the entity of RS reminded of 1992.
Europe does not care again. It closes its eyes and ears; it remains deaf to horrible statements of leaders from the entity of Republika Srpska. Europe does not react to daily threats of secession uttered by leaders from the entity of Republika Srpska, the same way it failed to react in July 1995 when it allowed massacre and genocide in Srebrenica to happen. Europe tolerates dangerous propaganda about Bosnia and Herzegovina as an “impossible state” which is repeated by those who celebrate Mladić and Karadžić and who obstruct its each step toward a functional state, future member of the European Union. It is because of such policy of president of RS and his followers that Bosnia and Herzegovina, unlike the whole civilized world, is the country whose parliament has not adopted the resolution of Srebrenica. Even Serbia has done it, acknowledging, though euphemistically, genocide in Srebrenica. For the same reasons, Bosnia and Herzegovina still has no law which would sanction negation of genocide in Srebrenica. Political project of Karadžić and Mladić is still alive in heads of certain leaders of Bosnian Serbs. Their criminal spirit still hovers threateningly over Bosnia and Herzegovina and its future.
I do not want to scare anyone. It is not my aim to disturb conformist atmosphere of European capital cities. However, I do not have the right to close my eyes before everyday open threats and racist offences we are exposed to. I do not have that right because of 8.372 Bosniak men who were shot by Mladić’s criminal death squads from July 11 to July 16 of 1995. I cannot be silent because of boys from Srebrenica who were shot in the back of their heads by Milošević’s killers from notorious squad called “Scorpios”, although they were supposed to be protected by Blue Helmets of Dutch battalion. My message to those who are rhetorically shooting into Bosnia and Herzegovina again is that Srebrenica will never be and cannot be anywhere else except in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Both Srebrenica, and Tomašica cave where almost thousand innocent civilians were thrown and hundreds of other mass graves scattered throughout the territory of Republika Srpska will never be anywhere else except in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No secession or referendum can change that. We will never accept crossing the border in order to recite the Fatiha to our murdered brothers and sisters.
Dear friends,
I am convinced that you understand our sensitiveness when someone touches our wounds that are still open, and Srebrenica is our deepest wound. Hopefully a critical mass will finally be created among leaders of Bosnian Serbs, predominance of those who have the strength to face the truth about the past. We must finally master lessons from the past and turn towards the future. We believe in reconciliation and reintegration. We are committed to building joint future in Bosnia and Herzegovina integrated into the European Union.
We believe that strength of the integration process will overwhelm relics from the past and free the way towards brighter future.
It is with this hope that we will say goodbye to 175 shehids of Srebrenica genocide on July 11 and bury them in Memorial centre in Potočari.
Let eternal rahmat be bestowed upon them.
Thank you!"
63573,"Address by the BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović at „Forum for Prosperity and Jobs in Bosnia and Herzegovina“, May 26, 2014",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=63573&langTag=en-US,2014-05-26,"In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we want sustainable, efficient and socially equitable development in the interest of present and future generations. We want to build a dynamic economy based on knowledge and innovations-economy with greater number of better jobs and social equality. I have recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to create 100,000 new jobs in the next eight years. This vision is achievable if we utilize advantages we have and opportunities that arise.
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to take part in this Forum.
I would like to thank the Delegation of the European Union for organizing this gathering.
I am very pleased to be joined today by Mr. Ali Babacan, Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey and Mr. Frank Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany. Your presence and support are very important to us. Bosnia and Herzegovina can certainly apply many lessons and experience of highly successful development models of Germany and Turkey.
This is an excellent opportunity for representatives of authority, economic, political, civil, academic, business and media community that have gathered here to define together perspectives and strategy of socio-economic development of our country.
The focus of development of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the following period certainly must include following goals:
1. strengthening macroeconomic stability, by reducing public expenditure, upgrading public finance and better approach to sources of financing, especially for small and medium enterprises.
2. enhancing competitiveness of economy, by improving competencies of human resources, development of scientific, technological and business infrastructure, and establishment of single market and economic space.
3. employment, especially by accelerating job creation through development of small
and medium enterprise, efficient functioning of job market and adjusting education
system to market needs
4. attraction of foreign direct investments, especially through quality presentation of our comparative advantages and potential, and improvement of regulatory framework and investment climate.
5.rural development and faster development of agriculture,
6.development of energy potential, especially renewable energy sources
7.development of transport infrastructure and communication
8.development of environment management and protection
9.strengthening social protection and greater social inclusion
10.acceleration of the European Union integration process
What we need right now is a package of concrete, realistic and feasible policies and measures to accomplish these goals in the following eight years.
In order to ensure its realization and sources of financing, there must be full, sustainable and long-term consensus of domestic political, social and economic partners on this package, but it also has to be supported by the European Union, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, European Bank for Development and Reconstruction and other international partners.
That would be the real Agreement for development and prosperity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we want sustainable, efficient and socially equitable development in the interest of present and future generations. We want to build a dynamic economy based on knowledge and innovations-economy with greater number of better jobs and social equality.
I have recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to create 100,000 new jobs in the next eight years. This vision is achievable if we utilize advantages we have and opportunities that arise.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has an excellent geographical position, distinguished by proximity of the European Union and Mediterranean markets.
We have various and rich natural resources, including unpolluted soil and favourable climate.
We have a great opportunity to develop energy sector, eco-tourism, organic agriculture, wood processing and biomass.
We have possibility to satisfy our needs for food, but also to export food-especially organic products that are highly demanded on European market.
We have quality work force, research and management staff in our country and abroad, renowned domestic companies which have experience in doing business around the world.
I am sure that with quality appearance, we can attract foreign investments and open up new markets for our companies abroad.
We must conduct economic policy that is accountable; build a rational and functional administrative apparatus which will serve the needs of citizens and economy, rather than its own needs.
This implies reducing costs and size of public administration at all levels, rationalization, removing overlaps, revising economic validity, expediency and performance of certain agencies and institutions, stopping over-expenditure and establishing criteria to gauge responsibility and performance of managerial staff in public institutions and companies.
Budget savings and accumulated assets of public companies and income should be directed in development and employment funds, especially grants and favourable loans for development of small and medium companies in the sectors where we have competitive advantages and potential.
We must decidedly fight against corruption and economic crime, make a revision of privatisation and compliance with privatisation contracts, investigate the origin of property, and ensure that Prosecutor's offices and courts accelerate criminal prosecution of the cases of corruption, economic crime, tax evasion and malversations in the privatization process. We also must be more efficient in tax and income collection.
It is also necessary to accelerate and simplify launch of business activities and investments. For instance, the procedure to register new business takes 11 steps and lasts around 37 days, which ranks our country as 174th in the world by the World Bank. This procedure must be reduced to last one day, and this can be achieved by establishing institution which would provide all services in one place.
A range of measures must be taken to improve business climate and environment, remove different administrative barriers and simplify regulatory framework for business, especially regarding payment of tax and contributions, gaining constructors licences and property recording, reduce pseudo-fiscal and tax burdens, especially regarding contributions, and introduce easements and incentives for small and medium enterprises.
Our judicial system must be more efficient and faster in persecuting economic disputes and forced execution of contractual obligations, in order to ensure a greater level of investment protection. Thus investors would be more certain in their decision to invest in our country.
Primary responsibility to conduct necessary reforms rests, of course, with domestic political actors.
However, Europe also must have a more decisive approach.
The situation we face takes a change of relation and approach- this includes us, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and our friends in Europe.
We do not ask for bar to be lowered, or conditions and obligations to be changed. It is clear to us that we must accept all the rules of Acquis Communautaire.
However, the question of when and how we will meet those requirements can be topic of more flexible approach of the European Union.
The greatest help that the European Union could provide us at this point would be to approve of candidate status of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so that we can start negotiations on certain chapters as soon as possible.
All the current preconditions for our candidacy should be transferred to negotiations on chapters in candidate status.
Thus, the current deadlock would be removed, and all the necessary reforms, including Constitution reforms, would become topic of negotiations within certain chapters that relate to them.
Let us start with obligations we can fulfil right now and that we can agree upon internally, and leave difficult ones for later.
That is flexibility that Europe can demonstrate in order to enable us to accelerate the accession process.
Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves it.
Dear friends,
Today's Forum is taking place in a very difficult moment for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our country was afflicted by natural disaster of catastrophic proportions in the past days.
It is only in the following weeks that we will have precise assessments and analyses of total private and public material damage and economic losses caused by this disaster.
However, we can say right now that damages and losses are enormous, and they can be measured in millions of BAM.
According to initial reports, 44 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Brčko District, with near 1,7 million people, were afflicted by floods and landslides.
Dozens of thousands of our citizens lost their homes and existence, hundreds of firms and agricultural parcels are flooded, roads, bridges, railway network, schools and many other private and public facilities are destroyed.
Situation in afflicted areas is extremely difficult and complex, and requires all the government institutions to engage in damage repair and removing the consequences of this affliction.
We must build a national recovery plan of afflicted areas. This plan needs to contain short-term, medium- and long term measures to be taken at all levels of authority.
Every discussion about the future development of Bosnia and Herzegovina must begin with recovery and reconstruction of afflicted areas.
The Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and governments of the two entities and Brčko District, together with municipalities and cantons should jointly make an assessment of damages, as well as analysis of needs and priorities in recovery process, and based on those parameters prepare a comprehensive national recovery plan. The plan will be a product of internal agreement of institutions at all levels and will be supported by the European Union and other relevant international institutions.
We will employ all the disposable and available financial resources we possess, as well as material resources to implement the plan of recovery and reconstruction.
Nevertheless, we are aware that our needs will surpass our capacities. Hence we have decided to organize, as soon as necessary preconditions are created, an international donor conference in order to collect devices that are not available in our country.
We will require help form the European Union funds, as well as from friendly countries. Regardless of the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have candidate status and it is not in the process of pre-accession negotiations, we expect European Union members to demonstrate humanity, solidarity and will, by making it possible for our country to access, among others, assets from European Union Solidarity Fund, especially bearing in mind wider regional implications of this natural disaster.
I avail myself of this opportunity to thank European Union member countries, as well as other neighbouring and friendly countries for their help in past days.
In these very difficult moments, our country, all their citizens and institutions, need unity. This natural disaster has united us and woken again the centuries-old spirit of Bosnia and Herzegovina- the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is vital and resistant. In its history, it overcame more difficult atrocities. I am sure it will rise again- and we will reconstruct together everything that this natural disaster destroyed.
Thank you for your attention!"

Ladies and gentlemen,
Welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the city of Sarajevo.
It is a true pleasure to attend this important gathering.
More than 150 members from 20 member states and NATO partners is a sure sign that this topic is very significant nowadays.
I would like to thank NATO Public Diplomacy Division for its decision to organize this conference in our country.
In this way, Bosnia and Herzegovina is trusted as a reliable and important partner, and future NATO member.
Esteemed friends,
I am convinced that topic of the conference is timely and highly useful.
We must not ignore the fact to which point social networks and media participated in changing social reality in various countries of the world. The reality that appeared unchangeable just a few years ago.
When it comes to my country, I would like to point out the fact that institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina set great store by regular and transparent informing the public about integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina in NATO.
We would especially like to explain to the public the nature of this association, participation of BiH in developing NATO partner policies, as well as contribution of Bosnia and Herzegovina to peacekeeping operations.
We do not want to be satisfied merely by afore mentioned, we would like to convince all our citizens about the benefit of integration that represents an exclusive club of the most developed and progressive countries- countries which demonstrate on daily basis, by means of their functioning, criteria and most important of all, common values, why this goal is desirable, but also doubtlessly attainable for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In 2003, the BiH Presidency defined approach to the European Union and NATO as strategic goals of Bosnia and Herzegovina through document entitled “General Directions and Priorities for Implementation of Foreign Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina”
In 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina formally joined NATO “Partnership for Peace” program.
The BiH Presidency applied for NATO Membership Action Plan as the final phase towards full membership in 2009.
Unfortunately, a part of political establishment in Bosnia and Herzegovina ignores decisions of the BiH Presidency and deliberately slows down our steps to this important military-political alliance.
That is why for years we have not been able to implement a technical-legal norm such as registration of 63 perspective locations at Ministry of Defence of BiH, which is a precondition for MAP.
I would like to send out message from here that major part of Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to be part of NATO alliance and it will persevere in achieving that goal regardless of obstacles.
Finally, I would like to point out that in spite of challenges we face on the path to NATO integration, we are very proud of our contribution through participation in NATO-led peace- support operations.
The fact that our country went from being beneficiary to becoming a factor of security is a great achievement.
Dear friends,
Natural users and creators of website content are young people who formulate, articulate and represent their attitudes by means of relatively new spectrum of social networks.
Hence it is important to present end explain in true and transparent manner policies of very NATO members and partner countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina through these communication channels, whose number of users grows exponentially year by year.
Informed and self-confident public, which does not refrain from asking right questions, is one of preconditions for all those values to take deep root in our ground.
It is the best shield against attempts of misuse and wrong topics that are often imposed upon us.
I am convinced that in the next two days you will elaborate adeptly all aspects of this topic and find best ways to send out your messages to the public through social networks and modern web technologies.
Nowadays it is highly important.
I wish you success in your work.
Cheers!"

Bosnia is one of those places on earth where many geopolitical, cultural and religious relations and interests tangle and untangle. That is why it carries a heavy burden of history, and the last hundred years can be rightfully called a century of warfare and violent transitions.
People’s political parties, whose members have gathered here, have been established in one of the most difficult periods of our recent history. During that period, they protected and articulated interest of their own people the best way they could. History will judge if they could have done it better.
We have different opinions about that time. We will not be able to agree about those visions of the past. However, it is more important to agree about the future. I am convinced that we can do that!
Building European future is a clearly expressed wish and vital interest of all the people in this country. Integration into the European Union is the only realistic platform on which we can ensure long-term stability and prosperity. Our absolute interest is to be part of community of organized countries where peace, understanding and a culture of negotiation prevail. The process of adjusting to European standards is the best tool for reforms through which we can achieve an organized society and country.
However, in spite of wish we expressed and interest that is recognized, there has been a stalemate in integration process and our country is lagging more and more behind in comparison with other countries in the region.
The question ahead which needs answer is: how to overcome this stalemate and move forward on the European path?
First of all, I think that we must truly turn to and devote to the future. Our country has realistic possibilities to make a great progress in a short span of time. It takes political will and trust to make the progress. Trust is built only by mutual respect, joint action, true and intensive communication and cooperation. We must stop succumbing to cheap populism, overcome narrow interests and used up political stereotypes. We must interpret more correctly interests of those we represent, be wiser, more responsible and ready to learn from previous mistakes. In order to build the future, we must make compromise. In the Balkans, many people consider compromise as weakness, but contrary is the truth. It takes courage to compromise.
Common future in this country can only be built by agreements which take into account interests and rights of the country, the three constituent peoples and each citizen.
History teaches us that Bosnia and Herzegovina moves forward only when everyone in it feels comfortable. Hence, future reforms in this country should not follow the direction of centralization or decentralization; they should rather take the direction of harmonization and coordination.
Political processes must be led in a way to benefit all the peoples of this country, because each step forward is possible only if it is in common interest.
Joint statement to be signed by our parties today is exactly one of those steps. It contains all the principles that I am talking about. This statement opens a new chapter in cooperation of our parties when it comes to building common future.
Our citizens want a functional state where law and common sense prevail. They want social justice and economic prosperity. They are also right to be dissatisfied with the current state of affairs.
Although a lot has been done in the past 18 years, more could and must have been done. There were mistakes and missed opportunities. Dissatisfaction that citizens demonstrated is a warning that things must change rapidly. We must stop wasting our time arguing about unrealistic scenarios and requests that will not be accepted by the other two sides. There is only one realistic road to the future, and that is not the path of splits, dissolutions and disintegration, it is the path of connection, cooperation and integration.
Hence I invite you to commit to task which will bring prosperity to everyone, which will bring tangible economic and social benefit to all citizens. Let us turn to serious debate about economic development, foreign investment attraction, job creation, and improvement of standard of living of our citizens, especially the most endangered social categories. Let us also devote to leading accountable economic policy, building rational administrative apparatus which serves citizens' needs.
We must start a decisive battle against crime and corruption, perform revision of privatization, be more efficient regarding collection of tax and contributions, save by reducing costs and size of public administration, release unused funds from public companies, and then channel those funds-in the form of direct grants and favourable loans-in development projects in areas where we have potential and comparative advantages. It is particularly important to focus on development of entrepreneurship and launching small and medium enterprises, because they are best generators of economic development and job creation.
As far as European integrations are concerned, the main task is to adequately and permanently empower institutions to lead the process of European Union accession. The Dayton Constitution did not do it, because it was not its goal. Although we hoped, experiences so far show that the flaw cannot be rectified by the very process of accession.
During implementation of almost every European condition or obligation there were arguments between different levels of government regarding responsibilities and actions. Europe expects us to communicate unanimously. Precondition for that is previous harmonization of communication within domestic institutions.
Complex organization of our country proved to be a serious challenge in the process of internal harmonization. Hence it is essential to establish an effective mechanism for permanent solution of conflicts and coordination of European matters within existing institutions. That mechanism must accept Dayton Constitutional order and serve as its addition, rather than dissolution.
Primary responsibility rests with domestic political actors. However, more resolute political approach on the part of Europe which accepts specificities of Bosnia and Herzegovina is needed. We do not ask for lowering the bar. We ask for stronger support to overcome that bar. We do not ask for favours or shortcuts, changing conditions and obligations. It is clear that we must accept all the rules of Acquis Communautaire.
However, the question of when and how we will meet these requirements might be a subject of a more flexible approach. We should start with responsibilities we can fulfil at this moment, those that we can agree about. Responsibilities which are more difficult to meet, the complex ones, should be postponed.
The European Union can demonstrate flexibility and create dynamics which will enable us to overcome existing deadlock and accelerate accession process.
Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves it.
Esteemed friends from Europe and Bosnia and Herzegovina!
The most difficult section of the road to recovery of this country is behind us. In order to move forward on that road, a change of the relation and approach is needed, both on our side, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as our friends around Europe.
We who are gathered here share the similar vision of the future-it is a stable, prosperous, democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a member of the European Union. I am convinced that we possess enough wisdom and European mind-set to overcome challenges ahead.
Goals of this generation of political leaders are preservation of peace, internal and external integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I truly believe that we are all aware of that and capable of fulfilling that mission.
Thank you."

I would like to use this opportunity to, before all, congratulate the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina March 1st – Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a glorious day in the history of this country, significant for many things. It is one of the dates which can surely be considered a milestone in a thousand-year-old history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It should be observed, it should be celebrated regardless it is not being done on the territory of the whole of BiH, in hope that one day it will be, that one day, all of us who live in this country will accept it as an important moment, 1 March 1992, an important moment in history of the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all its peoples and citizens.
In view that there will be twenty years since the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina next year, I wish to express hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina, after all the events which it has lived through in its turbulent history as an independent state, will enter a phase of a normal and stable democratic state. The fact is that Bosnia and Herzegovina is after such a long time since the referendum on independence, and particularly after the war, fighting with its internal controversies which we can observe also as ethnic controversies, as controversies that concern general human rights of us as individuals, as citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with controversies of transition, the escalation of which we had a chance to see twenty days ago.
The year of 2014 is the election year. I hope that, regardless of what happens in elections this year, Bosnia and Herzegovina will obtain a government which will realise the importance of this moment, the importance of, ultimately, sacrificing for this country, for all people of this country. It certainly looks from this place that we are entering a new phase, a new time for Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is up to all of us, and primarily up to those who were elected by the people to lead this country, to what extent it will be good and to what extend it will be bad.
I wish you all the best! Thanks to all of you who are attending this reception, with a wish for Bosnia and Herzegovina to celebrate many more Independence Days. We have reasons to be proud of this day and we have reasons to mark and celebrate it.
Once again, happy Independence Day, I wish you much happiness and success.
Thank you for coming."
60299,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the marking of the remembrance to the holocaust victims organized by the Jewish community in BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60299&langTag=en-US,2014-01-27,"On today’s day, 69 years ago, the notorious concentration camp Auschwitz was liberated. Auschwitz, as well as other Nazi concentration camps throughout Europe, was the largest “death factory”, evil which would leave indelible scars on the face of humanity.
Members of the Jewish community,
Excellencies and eminencies,
Dear friends,
Ladies and gentlemen!
We are here today to pay respect to the victims of the holocaust, in human history, the most horrid systematic, authorised and organised persecution and murder of millions of Jews, by the state, that is, the Nazi regime.
On today’s day, 69 years ago, the notorious concentration camp Auschwitz was liberated. Auschwitz, as well as other Nazi concentration camps throughout Europe, was the largest “death factory”, evil which would leave indelible scars on the face of humanity.
All that the Jews, but also other members of persecuted minorities went through during the Second World War unfortunately bear witness to the fact that evil in people can be infinite and inconceivably brutal.
The closest members of my family died in a Nazi camp – I grew up trying to grasp the reasons which make people into nonhumans. I have never managed to comprehend these reasons even as an adult in the time when the evil was repeated during the aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am sure in one thing, and that is, when evil and violence are of question, we must always and repeatedly oppose it.
Much is known today about the holocaust victims and the ways in which crimes were committed against those people. However, despite this fact, the whole world is obliged to continue to research and reveal every detail.
We must never give up from speaking the truth and warning the current and future generations about the importance of opposing to evil people and their sick ideologies.
By marking of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day we are cherishing the memory of the past and a pay duly respect to the victims, but we also trying to ensure a safer future.
Nothing similar, never and nowhere, must happen again.
Surely, such sentences can sound frustrating because genocides continued to happen after the holocaust. One of them also happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the last war, and all that in front of the cameras and the eyes of the whole world. It also happened in Rwanda, as well some other countries.
One of the God’s books says – “Fight on the side of the good, even if you are stunned by the amount of evil.”
We must continue to warn and do our best to reduce and prevent evil and violence.
People must be equal and respected. They must be safe wherever they life, minorities in particular.
God’s peace be upon the holocaust victims, as well as the victims of other genocides and crimes committed wherever and whenever in the world.
Thank you."
60295,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the opening ceremony of the restored amphitheatre and auditorium at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Sarajevo,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60295&langTag=en-US,2013-12-06,"Esteemed excellencies,
Respected professors and assistants,
Dear students!
It is my pleasure to participate in such a delightful event – official opening of a restored amphitheatre and auditorium at the Faculty of Political Sciences of the University in Sarajevo.
I thank all those who contributed to the restoring of this space, firstly the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish Coordination and Cooperation Agency TIKA, as well as the Turkish people as a whole.
There is a long list of projects which the Turkish Government realized in Bosnia and Herzegovina through its TIKA agency.
I will specify just a few of those (out of the total of 130 in the last three years), such as the restoration of the bridge in Konjic, the renovation of the building of the Civil Engineering Faculty in Mostar, the construction of a Memorial Gallery “Srebrenica”, modernization of a 100 maktabs in Sarajevo, the re-construction of a mosque in Fazlagića Kula, the renovation and equipment of schools in Travnik and Novi Travnik, renovation of Merhamet public kitchen in Zenica, renovation of the General Hospital in Doboj, the project of carpet production in Bosanski Petrovac, and there are also numerous projects in agriculture and livestock breeding in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina…
Just recently, TIKA has also finished the renovation of Karađoz-bey’s madrassa in Mostar which will also be opened today, and tomorrow there will be two opening ceremonies – the “Memorial House of Alija Izetbegović” in Bosanski Šamac, as well as a new Health Clinic in Visoko.
Historical and friendly relationships between the Turkish and Bosnian-Herzegovinian people and our states are profound and constructive.
Much is known about them, and thank God, they will remain as such.
We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are pleased about a remarkable progress has been making in the past ten years, as well as its ever greater capability to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in its development and Euro-Atlantic integrations.
Investment in education is one of the best ways for cooperation between two countries, and the Government of the Republic of Turkey has been helping us enormously in that segment.
Along the International University which has given the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidža a whole new energy, of a de facto contemporary student city, there is the support in the development of our state universities.
The Faculty of Political Sciences of the University in Sarajevo, where we are today, has in the past half a century grown into a respectable scientific institution.
A great human potential which it possesses in its faculty and students has deserved better working conditions.
I am pleased with the fact that TIKA as precisely in this place recognized space for engagement and support.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a peripheral area between the East and the West, has traditionally and in modern times been shaped in the summation of the scientific and civilizational achievements of the East and the West.
Modern Bosnia and Herzegovina firmly stands on a position that knowledge is the productive force and civilizational worth, and that scientific research and academic education of its citizens is one of the most important conditions for its success.
Development of education is the interest and the goal for Bosnia and Herzegovina and all its levels of government.
Only educated and mindful people can be a development factor of every society, and so the Bosnian-Herzegovinian one.
In post-war period, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant steps towards development of a network of high education, by joining the Bologna system of education which has for a while been an established educational system in the European countries.
The strongest lever for modernisation of our society is in the young people who are educated according to the most modern European standards.
Regardless of all apparent and political difficulties in our society, Bosnia and Herzegovina is successfully confronting the challenges and obligations which the inevitable educational progress imposes.
Respected friends!
I wish for the knowledge and critical mind of our young people be developed and spread in this reconstructed amphitheatre of the Faculty of Political Sciences.
I remind that generations of former students of this faculty have significantly impacted the dynamic of relations in the country and I am sure it will remain to be so in the future.
Without a strong, autonomous and free academic community, there is no strong democratic society. And such a society, all together, we wish to build in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you! Cheers and all the best!"
60288,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at a Conference over the marking of the 20th anniversary of the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (The Hague Tribunal),https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60288&langTag=en-US,2013-11-27,"Your Excellencies,
Estemeed organisers, participants and guests of the Conference,
Dear ladies and gentlemen!
I wish you welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina and I thank you for the invitation to hold the opening speech.
This conference is organized over the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, with an aim to open discussion on the role, significance and results of the Tribunal since its beginning to date.
While assessing the effects of the Hague Tribunal, its contribution, heritage and a message it leaves for the victims and perpetrators, states and peoples, international politics, law and justice, contemporaries and our children, the present and the future, I have to say that my opinion is divided.
But before I elaborate such a stance, I wish to highlight certain important facts. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the state which has, without any doubt, suffered most during the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia.
A brutal aggression was committed against the country, and genocide over the Bosniaks was committed. That is the truth.
I recently visited Tomašica near Prijedor, the largest mass grave after the Second World War in Europe, in which over 400 bodies of killed men, women and children have been found to date.
It is estimated that around 1000 bodies will be discovered.
I invite all those with conscience to visit the horrid places like Tomašica, which this country is full of, to see the picture of crime close up, out of sterile interiors of courtrooms, salons and cabinets.
Mister Meron has done that and with his human gesture paid respect to the innocent victims.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I cannot help feeling that there are two Hague Tribunals.
The first, established by the Resolution 827 of the United Nations in 1993, which was affirmed by persecutors and judges who shared enthusiasm and full awareness that they are doing something special, historically valuable.
That is the Tribunal which sent encouraging messages around the world that crime must be punished – that this is the civilizational achievement and a moral debt to the victims.
This first Tribunal, I hold in high esteem.
The hopes and convictions of my people were interwoven in its work – particularly those of the victims’ families – those hopes and convictions that there is justice in this world.
It is precisely that Hague Tribunal which passed some historically important judgments for Bosnia and Herzegovina, primarily, putting its stamp on the truth on the siege of Sarajevo and genocide in Srebrenica.
Along with that, the Tribunal gave enormous contribution to the development of international criminal law, and through its work, it promoted the principles of human rights protection on the international scene.
In particular, it should be noted that the act of rape, that is, sexual violence in an armed conflict, were for the first time adjudicated as a crime against humanity by the ICTY verdicts.
Unfortunately, in time which followed the Tribunal slowly moved away from its initial ideals and hopes. Behind the curtains and in silence a new, different Tribunal was being born, a court which, as contemporary analysts and numerous intellectuals claim, grew tired under the pressure of great and powerful interests and set itself a goal just to finish the job.
That new court started looking at committed crimes and victims with different eyes.
Because, how else can one understand the acquittals on Appeal of the heads of military, police and intelligence structures for command responsibility?
From a moral and legal point of view they are, to put it mildly, a matter of concern.
It is impossible, even for lawyers, let alone the victims, to explain how the defenders who were convicted in the first instance verdicts to 20 and more years of imprisonment for the gravest crimes, acquitted from responsibility in the Appeal.
It cannot be a valid argument, nor is it pertinent to talk about the knowledge or the lack of knowledge of judges of the one and the same court – where ones pass verdicts of 20 or more years imprisonment, and others completely acquit defenders.
Those responsible for the crimes from the top of the pyramid – planners, commanders and organisers – are evading justice.
The command responsibility has become almost impossible to prove.
Planners and commanders of crimes have become untouchable, practically protected from criminal prosecution.
The victims are asking what the world in which they live is like.
Is justice reachable to ordinary people, or is that just a privilege of those who are powerful?
How much is a life of a little man in the Balkans worth? Masterminds, planners of the crimes and genocide who took lives of tens of thousands of people, and aggrieved millions, will all together spend a few decades in comfortable prisons around Europe.
What message does this send to the victims, and what to the planners and lords of future wars?
Ladies and gentlemen!
The Hague Tribunal has not yet finished its job. A few important, capital processes remain. As the first president of Bosnia and Herzegovina once said – even war criminals have their rights.
Their right is a just punishment. A mental relief.
And he said another thing, which I repeat here: “We believe in justice even though it is sometimes slow!”
Therefore, despite all, citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that the Hague tribunal will finish it job returning to its initial idea, the idea of universal justice, fairness and humanity.
We believe the justice is reachable and that the Hague tribunal has its historical role in its achievement.
The interest of the victims must return to focus, and their interest is justice! And that is not only the interest of the victims, but also the interest of everyone who wishes to live in a better and safer world.
Thank you!"
60284,"Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the reception on the occasion of the Sovereignty Day, Sarajevo, 25 November 2013",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60284&langTag=en-US,2013-11-25,"Esteemed excellencies, respected guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
Thank you for attending tonight the ceremony of the marking of 25 November, the Sovereignty Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Full 70 years have passed since the Founding Assembly of the State Antifascist Council of the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Mrkonjić Grad, one of the key events in the building of the modern statehood of our country.
At this assembly, centuries-old statehood continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed, which preceded its entry into the then Federative Yugoslavia, a few days later at the Second Assembly of AVNOJ in Jajce.
The historical facts are clear: Bosnia and Herzegovina was not created with the establishment of Yugoslavia, but just as is the case with other republics; it became its part with its defined sovereignty and territory.
The core ZAVNOBiH resolution permanently confirmed Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state of its citizens and equal peoples Muslims, that is Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats as well as members of other peoples and ethnic groups.
That historical agreement was based on, before all, antifascism as a core value and it should presently serve as an inspiration to new generations of leaders in confronting evil and xenophobia, as well as searching for dynamic formulae of full mutual respect and life together.
Bearing in mind the time and historical context, in which they were passed, the key messages of ZAVNOBiH, have not lost its universal value even seven decades later.
Therefore, those who negate ZAVNOBiH and this holiday of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and who cynically call it partial or non-existent, are disqualified themselves and are distancing themselves from the honoured marking of something which should a be a joint positive heritage and civilizational achievement of the first order and importance.
Someone who does not respect own history, own ancestors, can surely hardly expect to ever be a factor of stabilization, cooperation and progress.
The ZAVNOBiH negators and their antifascist platforms are those who do not have the strength nor wish to dissociate themselves from fascism and the darkest barbarism which reaped havoc in this country and left behind itself Srebrenicas, Tomašicas, Kozarac, Zvornik, the live pyres of Višegrad…
They have own choice, and we have ours.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, in all of its three national corpses and among all of its citizens, there are enough of those good, honourable and well-intentioned people who love their country, who wish it well and whose history they view in its fullness and unbroken continuity without forgeries, ideological prejudice and any other exclusivity.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
Bosnia and Herzegovina, with all of its burdens and problems, perplexities and dilemmas, is going in the right direction.
Perhaps we are going slowly, at times with longer halts, but our goals are clear and they will be achieved.
Our country will become a full and equal member of the European Union and the NATO Alliance, a prosperous and stable European state.
When will these goals be achieved?
When there is more political will, readiness for compromise and national consensus on the most important questions for a joint future.
It should also be said that, at least in the foreseeable future, Bosnia and Herzegovina will not be a comprehensive and stratified society it once was.
The aggression and violent segregation have done their part.
However, the results of the recently held census will show that the basic substance of a multinational community, the soul of this country has been preserved.
Although atrocious crimes have been committed throughout its territory, the entity of RS has not been completely ethnically cleansed.
Almost the fifth of the population which lives in that half of Bosnia and Herzegovina are Bosniaks and Croats.
And people will, for I am convinced, continue to return to their land, to restore their houses and properties in the time ahead.
They will live in the same country, together, villages and towns will rely on the same state structure, on the same institutions.
There are numerous examples which witness that people in the whole country are already cooperating and they will increasingly cooperate for mutual benefit.
The recovery trend in the multinational relations, along with occasional crises and halts, is clear. Things are looking up.
Gradually, a society will be built in which all of us will feel safe and pleasant.
Differences attract each other, they are our wealth and in time, do not doubt this, there will be more communication and communion.
There will be more and more of Bosnia and Herzegovina which we remember and which we wish to restore.
To all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I congratulate 25 November, the Statehood Day.
Thank you and cheers!"

Excellencies,
Esteemed members of the academic community,
Ladies and gentlemen!
I am honoured with your invitation to address this respected gathering in Sarajevo, which hosts the 3rd anniversary of the International Balkan Annual Conference. On this occasion I would like to thank the organisers, Istanbul University, University of Sarajevo and the International University of Sarajevo for making such a thematic conference in Sarajevo possible.
Furthermore, I wish to praise the organisers for entitling this year’s conference “Bosnia and Herzegovina: in Common History and Multicultural Atmosphere of the Balkans” since this is a needy topic for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the current period.
Allow me to present some of my observations and link them to the current processes as I am neither a historian nor a philosopher, but someone who, led by the past experiences, analysis of today and forecast of the future, tries to create his political engagement believing in our “shared society.”
Our society is faced with the subject, rather than saying a problem, of a three-levelled common history and multiculturalism. The first level is the one within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the second is the perception of the “Balkan” region and the third level is actually the idea of Europe.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are boasting with our multiculturalism, multi-ethnicity, openness for diversities which is the result of precisely that common history and co-habitation experience. However, very often we can show the worst in us by shattering all those proclaimed values during war conflicts.
Moreover, our present shows that we are ready to create and maintain institutionalised discrimination over those we consider “unconstituent”.
In doing so, the inexorability of historical processes is forgotten, whereby more than half a century of peace and socialistic structure created a new collective identity which is characterised by an unsightly collective name of “others”.
Moreover, from a legal perspective, a question is posed how one nominally civic and secular state can have citizens who are constituent and those who are not constituent, although all of them have lived there for generations. Our political reality identifies “others” as otherness. As something which is not ours. As something which is not inherent to us, although these are actually the very people we use to boast to the world about our multiculturalism, co-habitation and common history.And to bring the matter to extreme consequences, these are people who declare themselves as Bosnians and Herzegovinians in the first place, in the state of the same name, and who are for this reason treated as ""others."" Do we thus have the right to criticise European nations for their resistance to other and different and for double standards towards “original Europeans” and “immigrants”?
The European bureaucracy created a geopolitical, marketing phrase “Western Balkans” for our region. Every man who learnt geography in these regions can ask a question: Isn’t therefore Greece Southern Balkans, and Rumania and Bulgaria Eastern Balkans? The Balkan is synonymous to conflicts, ethnic intolerances, backwardness and lack of perspective – an eternal powder keg. And that image is the result of our common history and different notion of multiculturalism, as co-habitation of ones with the others, or ones alongside the others.
My colleague by duty and yours by profession, Georgi Ivanov stated a counter thesis on this topic, that such an image of the Balkans, equally as the creation of the “Western Balkans”, is artificial. In fact, the Balkans has had long periods of peace “pax Romana” and “pax Otomana”, and intolerances and inter-ethnic conflicts came to surface in times of great geopolitical movements and births of “nations” in these regions. What is even a greater absurd; the nations are a product of civil revolutions which brought about the first concepts of human rights, freedoms, equality and brotherhood. Peoples in these regions have accumulated experience of co-habitation precisely in the centuries-long times of peace. It is perhaps for this reason that the European Union is perceived as a kind of “pax Europeana” merely wishing a better life and prospect of peace for their children.
Europe and the European Union are not the same although it may be striving for this. Our history is part of European history. And European history is no less bloody from the history of the Balkans. Thus the European Union was established as a project which should prevent wars amongst European nations and to turn them towards co-operation, economic, technologic and cultural development. What the European Union must not forget, is it wishes to maintain that project, are the core values upon which lies.
If we could find one thing that could be a message for Europe in the evil which was taking place in our region during the nineties, that would be the case of what happens when citizens are institutionally discriminated against on ethnic and religious basis and when all core values on which a civilised society rests are forgotten, and multiculturalism becomes a phrase we boast with.
Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to appreciate its belonging to the middle-ages Christian circle as well as the half-millennium long influence of the Ottoman Empire. Equally as almost half a century old Austro-Hungarian rule or half a century old socialist organisation which created foundations of the modern Bosnian-Herzegovinian society.
What makes Bosnia and Herzegovina today, with all its positive and negative sides, is the result of our common history and multiculturalism in the Balkans. People in Bosnia and Herzegovina have always been one society regardless of religious, ethnic or national origin. Sometimes they lived ones next to the others, and sometimes more ones with the others. But as part of one history, I dare say and also part of one special culture created by intertwining and permeation of diversity which became part of identity of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of some politicians trying to deny or annul this with their statements.
Thanks to that special multicultural identity of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, and all those Bosnians and Herzegovinians who are declaring in a different way, this country survives. That is why we must ask ourselves what we are doing, when we are denying equality to our citizens who are called by the name of the very country they live in. Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot therefore be a national state of the ones nor the others, but a secular and civic state which accommodates all and where everyone has equal rights and same opportunities. Anything else would represent civil regression.
Therefore, respected participants, I wish you success in the work during this scientific gathering and I thank you for your attention."

First of all I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, as well as members of your Team of 68th Session of General Assembly for being elected, and give you my full support in your future work.
Plenary meetings of the General Assembly have always been an opportunity for Heads of State to gather and exchange their opinions about the world situation in order to try to find solutions for contemporary global problems.
Mr. President,
My country's strategic goal of establishing a formal relationship and membership in the EU is based upon ambition of Bosnia and Herzegovina to become part of the big family of democratic states and thus assure full functionality of its own institutions and further development on the basis of free market, rule of law and especially human rights.
Based on the direction and foreign policy activities of Bosnia and Herzegovina our focus remains on furthering our institutional relationship with the EU, in accordance with the Stabilization and Association Agreement and its full implementation.
The aspiration of Bosnia and Herzegovina to become EU member is based upon wide political census.
The fact that the process of European integration demands comprehensive political, institutional and legal adjustments in order to reach European standards in all areas is of essential importance for my country.
We are also fully aware that active participation of all segments of society of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is necessary for the expedited process of European integration.
I expect that expediting the remaining activities, implementation of the Sejdic - Finci ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, will lead to fulfilment of requirements for application for accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU.
I am also hoping for positive development of events relating to fulfilling conditions for activating the NATO Membership Action Plan and further integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into NATO security structures.
I would also like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the final negotiation phase for accession to the World Trade Organization.
Please allow me to emphasize again that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a very clear stance relating to war crimes: All those accused of war crimes will be held responsible for the crimes of which they are accused of either before international or domestic courts.
Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina puts strong emphasis on regional and sub regional cooperation and dialogue between neighbouring countries whose cultures and traditions have been present in the Balkans for centuries, and which are currently at different stages of transition and democratic reforms.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is turned towards the future and cooperation with neighbouring countries on the basis of mutual respect as well as the respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The development of bilateral relations with all of our neighbouring countries and other countries in the region is focused on several key areas: advancing economic cooperation, the strengthening of regional cooperation and finding constructive solutions for current issues.
Our emphasis in regional cooperation is on the development of communication infrastructure as a basis for better economic, cultural, and scientific ties as well as overall regional development. The potential for regional economic ties are especially strong in the areas of industry, tourism, agriculture and energy.
I would especially like to emphasize our bilateral relations with the Republic of Croatia, which gained new dimension and dynamic with the Croatian accession to the EU and which was marked by eagerness on both sides to find solutions that are in best interests of both our countries.
Mr. President,
I have to state at this time, we continue to live through one of the greatest economic and financial crisis in contemporary history, which is certainly the greatest threat to global peace and security. We must do everything in our power to tackle its negative effects and consequences. Although the latest indicators show that some developed countries are coming out of recession, this is not the case with poor and developing countries, where the consequences of the crisis are very harsh.
Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been strategically working towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals; thus we deem that despite the difficulties caused by the world economic movements, there will be no obstacles to reach our set targets by 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina has finalized the ""Development Strategy for BiH"" and ""Social Inclusion Strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina"" while the “Strategy for Poverty Eradication“ has already been designed and implemented. All of these have been done in cooperation with the relevant UN agencies in BiH, and to whom we would like to thank for their intensive cooperation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready to contribute to global efforts in defining development framework followed by its implementation in order to readily face economic, social and environmental challenges. Considering that the importance of the above mentioned three aspects of sustainable development are crossing national borders, Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that regional cooperation is crucial for successful preparation for new post - 2015 development framework.
Bosnia and Herzegovina as, well as all the other Western Balkan countries at this integration phase, follow EU policy and views relating to the new development agenda. Bosnia and Herzegovina consistently supports the position that sustainable development is only possible in harmony with nature.
I am of the opinion that neither economic nor political interests must stand in the way of global consensus as the true beginning of the global fight for preservation of the natural balance of the planet. It is often forgotten that climate change has direct impact on development, poverty, hunger, and consequently on global peace and security. Short term solutions will have long term consequences, and the steps we take today will be our legacy for generations to come.
Mr. President,
All of us present here agree that the United Nations needs continuous and comprehensive reform, which should be done with great caution, assuring a wide consensus of member states. United Nations reform should provide efficient and coordinated functioning of all segments and bodies of the system. It is widespread opinion that reform of the Security Council is crucial for core reform of the world organization. This reform, done with the widest possible consensus of the member states, is necessary for reasons of efficiency and credibility, and that is only possible taking into account contemporary geostrategic reality, which differs from the one of 1945. Because only the Security Council reformed in such a manner can have full authority and respectability in addressing the most important issues of international peace and security, mandate entrusted to the Council by the United Nations Charter.
Dialogue and compromise are the best way to ensure the widest possible support to the reform, and Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the opinion that the Security Council reform should be moved from a standstill as soon as possible. We also believe that the reformed Security Council of the United Nations should have another space for a non-permanent member state from the Eastern European group as the number of countries from this group has more than doubled in last two decades.
I would also like to emphasize from this position that more engagement in preventative diplomacy is expected from the Security Council. We believe that more activity in such diplomacy would help solve many problems and crises before they intensify, which would be more efficient way for the Council to work. Encouraging dialogue to resolve critical issues by compromise, while acting against any kind of exclusiveness, especially in the sphere of human rights, is of utmost importance. Timely and efficient conflict prevention, instead of reaction to already escalated crises, is definitely a more efficient and less costly approach to international peace and security.
We are eager to share with others, both the good and the bad of our post conflict and peace building experiences. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that every crisis has to be studied carefully with great consideration for the roots of the conflict, culture, religion, local customs and all other factors in order to find a just and long term solution. There are no universal solutions for every crisis, and every single one should be paid attention to and considered separately.
Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that it is necessary to take tangible steps to prevent nuclear proliferation in the world.
Despite evident obstacles during the last decade, new initiatives give new momentum to the process of disarmament and anti-proliferation. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that nuclear disarmament can be achieved by encouraging member states that joined the Treaty to respect their obligations specified in the Non Proliferation Treaty. Bosnia and Herzegovina will sign the Arms Trade Treaty during the Arms Treaty Event.
Mr. President,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is gravely concerned about the continuous violence in Syria that has led to worsening of the humanitarian crisis and caused unacceptable suffering of the Syrian people, and is asking all parties to fulfil all of their obligations in accordance with international law and human rights.
Resolving the crisis in the Middle East continues to be one of the most important priorities of the World Organization. We believe that all possible steps should be made towards creating a positive climate in order to achieve just and comprehensive peace in this area. We expect all sides to refrain from any rushed actions and focus on beginning this very important dialogue.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to play a constructive role in international relations and contribute to self-sustainable peace and security, participates in the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports international efforts and actively participated in the UN Missions in Liberia, South Sudan and Cyprus.
Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to be very concerned that terrorist attacks around the world take the lives of innocent victims, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to fight terrorism and believes that results in this area could be achieved only through comprehensive cooperation and partnership of as many UN member states as possible.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is also following the situation on African continent with great interest. We expect that, in spite of the difficult world financial and economic crisis, most developed countries will continue to increase their contribution to the official development aid necessary for capacity strengthening in poor African countries. That is why we praise UN activities in the New Partnership for Africa's Development and efforts to set Africa on the path of stable and sustainable development, especially in regards to reaching the Millennium Development Goals. This particularly applies to the countries of sub- Saharan Africa. We also support all efforts of the African Union, African governments, and the UN directed at improvement of the rule of law, democracy and strengthening of civil society and institutions in order to raise the bar for all aspects of society. We are pointing out that continued financial aid to Africa, in a greater capacity, is just as important as strengthening the efficiency and transparency of using the aid funds for sustainable development.
Mr. President,
In today's world with political and social processes more dynamic than ever, when we are facing challenges so different from those of just few decades ago, it is becoming clear that only a strong multilateral approach can give good solutions. The United Nations Organization, in more than six decades of existence, has gone through difficult temptations, but was always, and continues to be, the only guide to a better future; it is still the only organization capable of providing solutions to a wide spectrum of global problems we are facing. It is up to us to make the World Organization stronger and more efficient, as it is the only most comprehensive and inclusive organization in existence today which can help bring progress and wellbeing to our planet. If we work together on implementation of all of our agreements reached at this respected place, there is no doubt that we will live in a better and more just conditions then is the case today. On that path we need to return to the basic values and principles of human rights, equality and world peace which are laid in the foundations of the United Nations.
Thank you Mr. President."
60263,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović in Bužim at the official academy over the Day of the 505th Knights Brigade,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60263&langTag=en-US,2013-08-16,"I am always glad to come to Krajina, particularly to knightly Bužim. It is here that the freedom, honour, pride and homeland are the most important words. During the time of frightening military superiority of the aggressor, Bosnia and Herzegovina was being defended with heart and blood of heroes.
My dear Krajina people,
Dear shaheeds’ and fallen solders’ family members,
Respected defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Respected friends, esteemed guests!
I am always glad to come to Krajina, particularly to knightly Bužim. It is here that the freedom, honour, pride and homeland are the most important words. During the time of frightening military superiority of the aggressor, Bosnia and Herzegovina was being defended with heart and blood of heroes. The white shaheed tombstones are the clearest testimony of our fight for Bosnia, freedom and dignity. Bužim, Krajina and Bosnia in August mark the most important dates of its newer history. In them, glory and pride, sorrow and memories intertwine.
The 505th Knights Brigade, one of the most famous regiments of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was formed on this day, 21 years ago. Its war path is the path of glory, military victories, but also selfless heroism and suffering. There is almost no soldier of this brigade who was not wounded in the fights for BiH, and 471 Bužim heroes’ lives laid their lives for free Bosnia and Herzegovina. A particular place in this collective memory and in the hearts of all Bosniaks belongs to Commander Izet Nanić, General, Golden Lily and hero of the defensive-liberation war. He died in the dawn of freedom, in a victorious liberating march of the units of our army, on 5 August, 18 years ago. The courage of Izet Nanić, his war heroism was and will forever remain the ideal for future generations who will look after our free and proud homeland.
Respected defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, dear friends!
The fact is, when we think back to that time 18 years ago, that the victorious march of our army was stopped at its peak. The powerful international creators of the peace process, in their plans and projections, did not allow a military victor in the war in BiH.
However, from this distance, and with full responsibility, I can say that our historical, moral victory no one can take away, nor can they dispute it, no matter how hard they tried. That victory is as clear as a teardrop, won in almost impossible conditions, in superhuman fight against double aggression and with imposed arms embargo for our army.
When the answers and explanations in the first post-war period were asked about how we managed to defend the state and the people, our President and Supreme Commander Alija Izetbegović said: “When the miracle of Bosnian resistance is being deciphered from some historical distance, it will be found that the secret was somewhere in the souls and the character of the people.” Unconquered Krajina and unwavering “heavens power” are the most prominent examples of that MIRACLE and that indestructible spirit. The whole of Bosnia knows that and that is respected by the Bosniaks and all Bosnian patriots, in war and in peace. I am often asked if Alija Izetbegović would be pleased with the achieved when he could see the state of us today. Bearing in mind all that we have been through, resistance and blockades which we faced and with which we are today also politically wrestling – I am convinced he would not be displeased. Because, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been preserved, saved. We have achieved most of strategic goals and the path forward is clear. However, we are progressing slowly, often with delays, but we are moving towards real goals. In the next decade, and do not doubt this, our country will be a member of the European Union and NATO.
Dear friends!
One more fact is clear and there is no dilemma about it: those who tried and wished to tire Bosnia have tired themselves. Bosnia is constant and unquestionable, and their time is passing, their political star is fading away. We will not remember them in a few years. The Bosniak politicians who every so often give “better offers“will not be any better off. They are those who are ready to take the country ten years back for their seats and a few years in the government. They promised a lot, but did little. They spent three years in political hoops, they got lost in own calculations and inadequacy to lead the country on its path of reform. However, we must not allow them to implement their “better offer”. We will not allow for the fear and lawlessness to forestall. The Ranković methods cannot be used to arrest honourable people and introduce a police state. They should know – that will not pass! We will not allow them to sell off the most valuable assets of Bosnia; they are under ownership of generations to come! There will be no dismissal of independent bodies and putting of judiciary under political control! We will now allow the change in the Electoral Law, so that no Bosniak could ever again be a mayor of Srebrenica! Their Law on Residency which would prevent Bosniaks from registering at their burned hearths in the RS will pass. We are not allowing them to elect the Law on Public Procurement, which would allow them the continuation of robbery!
My dear Krajina people!
Unfortunately, those who in peace, by political means wish to accomplish war aims have not left the historical scene. It has been shown that the division of Bosnia is an unattainable goal, but tries to revise the truth about the aggression on our country are a real danger and various services in the RS and Serbia are systematically dealing with this. They are trying to revise the past with various declarations, and relativize the guilt for the war. We must clearly send them a message: Forgeries will not pass! Those who were systematically committing crimes and those who were systematically preventing and sanctioning them cannot be equalised.
However, it is in The Hague that the most truthful history of Bosnia and Herzegovina is being written: Tuđman’s political and military adventure received its epilogue and its real name: “joint criminal enterprise”. And Karadžić will not only answer for the genocide in Srebrenica, but also for the genocide in Bratunac, Foča, Ključ, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Vlasenica and Zvornik. The forgers do not like it when we repeat these facts. They count that we will slowly start forgetting the truth about what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. They are wrong! There is no oblivion! There is no equating! There is no capitulation under lies! That is the first condition for the preservation of our pride and dignity! And it is precisely due to DIGNITY that we have been fighting for over two decades. Dignity of a Bosnian man! And we will continue to fight. We must never again allow for ourselves to be weak. Weakness attracts despots. Never again without own army. No demilitarisation, no disarmament.... No low budgets... I invite you here in Krajina today, in our Bužim: let’s be united, strong, conscientious and awake.
I know that all of you, as is the case with the majority of citizens of our country, are concerned with everyday problems. I know the living standards are low, that you are concerned for the existence and future of your children. You rightly ask when the political quarrels will stop and economy come into the fore of interest and action of politicians. I agree with you completely, and I do as much as is in my power to stabilise the state in the region and Bosnia and Herzegovina, because only a peaceful and political stable country attracts capital and investors. Investors run away from quarrels and conflict regions. You can also contribute for the conditions to change. Next year, do not give your vote to those who tricked you, those who are the most responsible for such situation in the state. Give your trust to those who will not betray you and who will return the country to the right path. Support those who will first and foremost be concerned with economic projects which will bring investors, open factories and new working places.
In the end, I wish to add: the census is taking place soon. Do not be confused by various fake ’chaplains’. We know who we are and do not need anyone to teach us that. We are BOSNIAKS; our religion is ISLAM; our language BOSNIAN! There is absolutely no dilemma about that! May all our noble shaheeds rest in peace and let there be eternal remembrance for the all the killed fighters of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you!"

That is the month of painful rememberance of our innocently killed brothers and sisters.

But, Srebrenica is not just the symbol of genocide and the worst crime in Europe after the Second World War.
Dear Heroes of the 28th Division of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Army,
Esteemed Reis-ul-Ulema ef. Kavazović,
Respected guests and friends,
Essselamu Aleykum and good day to you!
These are difficult days for our people.
July is, as one of the Srebrenica mothers said, the saddest month for us.
That is the month of painful rememberance of our innocently killed brothers and sisters.
In that month, all our pain over the tragedy and horrid injustice done to us is most clearly focused and presented.
But, Srebrenica is not just the symbol of genocide and the worst crime in Europe after the Second World War.
The Srebrenica genocide is the culmination of the centuries-old suffering of the Bosniaks, killings, banishment, destruction and burning of our homes, looting of our properties.
In great wars of the twentieth century, in great shifts and tectonic disturbances, us the Bosniaks have always been under fire.
Mainly as the object of historical events.
Weak, abandoned, politically unorganised, dispersed, we were an easy target to looters and killers who were mainly recruited from our closest neighbourhood.
Bosnia is swamped with bones of innocently killed Bosniaks, and the River Drina is our largest mass grave.
In the twentieth century, our grandfathers and grandmothers, fathers and mothers, have endured at least two wars and five states, five state or social systems.
Not one of these state systems was inclined to us.
From one epoch to another, from year to year, we were in increasingly worse position. All the poorer, politically disempowered, nationally indifferent.
We have been paying an enormous price just because we were Muslims and because we did not want to give up our religion.
When we straightened up, in a desire to be equal, when we somewhat recovered and organised ourselves politically, in the last decade of the previous century, we were most brutally attacked.
The objective was total destruction – genocide.
We were heavily wounded – yet not defeated.
The “miracle of Bosnian resistance” happened, as our first President and Supreme Commander Alija Izetbegović used to say.
A part of that miracle was the several days long breakout of the Srebrenica people, a hundred kilometres long, the breakout which the history of war has not seen before.
Alija also said: “We will not allow for Srebrenica and all that Srebrenica means happen ever again. That – that the genocide must never repeat – is and will be the greatest law which will guide the behaviour of our people in the future.”
These words of his we must never forget!
Dear Heroes of Srebrenica and Podrinje,
I know you are in your thoughts with those who should have been with us today, but who have been taken from us on the path of death, breaking through from Srebrenica to the free territory.
This line up is incomplete and sorrowful like the line up organised by Naser Orić at Zlača near Banovići on 25 July 1995.
However, it is not only the sorrow that is part of us, but there is pride, and strength, and determination not to succumb to evil, to hatred, to the forces who wished for us to banish.
This is precisely what we owe to the victims of Srebrenica and its heroes and shaheeds.
Theirs is the eternity, and our obligation is to further fight, not to sink into dispiritedness, resentment, bitterness, and internal conflicts.
We must accomplish their ideals, preserve and improve the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and our people, as well as make possible for the future generations to return to parents’ homes and live without fear of a new genocide.
We constantly repeat to ourselves and the world, from year to year, from day to day, from our pure moral position, from our bright page of our history, the following questions: How could this have happened to us, how did the world let this happen, how come they did not prevent a genocide at the end of the twentieth century, how did they allow concentration camps, rape, banishment, killing of thousands of children all around Bosnia and Herzegovina?
Those questions remain in the air with no answers.
They are followed by silence and nausea.
I said three days ago in Potočari: “Innocence and helplessness of victims has probably been so obviously and clearly faced with such cold and merciless hatred of criminals, as well as with unprecedented and shameful indifference of powerful world leaders in the Nazi camps of the Hitler's Germany only.”
“Where there is no justice, hatred enters,” one of the surviving Srebrenica men wrote.
However, even with awareness about all this, and with bitterness which has remained for these past 18 years, we should be grateful to those world leaders who feel for us these day and who clearly send a message that the genocide must not be denied and the perpetrators must be punished.
In the end, dear brothers and sisters, I wish for a clear message to be heard from here today, for ourselves, for our future and the future of our children.
That message we must always have in mind.
Never again should we be weak! Never!
The weakness attracts tyrants.
We must be uniform and well organised.
You, the best sons Bosnia has, I invite not to allow to be drawn into daily-political quarrels.
In those fights only manipulators take cheap benefits, and we all lose.
Those who spread lies and divisions expect precisely that.
Remain dignified.
Dignity is in fact the word which most precisely gives an answer when we are asked for what have we been fighting for decades?
For dignity of a Bosnian man.
But also against oblivion, humiliation, lies and injustice!
And we will continue, all together, to fight further!
May all the Podrinje and all our noble Bosnian shaheeds rest in peace!
Let there be eternal remembrance for the killed fighters of our heroic Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you!"

Dear mothers, dear members of the shaheed families of the Podrinje area!
Dear friends from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, who share our grief and compassion for the innocent victims of the Srebrenica genocide!
It has been 18 years today since the genocide in Srebrenica.
We have gathered here to accompany to their final rest mortal remains of four hundred and seven men, boys and elderly men, and of our two sisters – Behara Đelilović and Hajra Mulalić.
We will also bury today four fathers with two sons each: Šaban Salkić with his sons Senad and Smajo, Hamed Halilović with Hasan and Hamdija, Šaćir Rizvanović with Mirzet and Nijaz, Smajo Ibrahimović with Saib and Salih.
We will also accompany 44 minor boys to their final rest, including Nevzet Čević and Denif Halilović, who were only 14 when they were killed, and their friends who were just one year older - Sabahudin Ibišević, Fahrudin Smajlović, Suljo Mašić and Avdija Orić.
We will also lower down to her grave the smallest casket of an infant baby girl whom her mother Hava and father Hajrudin did not have time enough to name.
We have been asking ourselves in the course of these eighteen years to whom and what for they could possibly have been guilty of back in those hellish days of July 1995.
Words are insufficient to describe the crimes that took place here.
Hatred resulting in a multi-day systematic slaughter of 8,372 innocent men just because they were Bosniak Muslims, who defended their families, courtyards and homes they were born in is incomprehensible to a normal human being.
The scale of evil is illustrated by an unquestionable and horrible fact that during those hellish days the death squadrons of Karadžić and Mladić killed one Srebrenica man each minute, while not even sparing the lives of the 12, 13 or 14 year old boys, or of elderly men who were 80.
They did this in an organized, systematic way, down to the last captured person.
In the days, months and years that followed their mortal remains underwent repeated defilement while being transferred through hundreds of mass graves in the territory of 13 municipalities of the Podrinje region, and of five municipalities in Serbia.
In order to try to conceal the genocide, they repeated evil deeds by barbaric indulging in ridicule with the dead victims.
Dear mothers of Srebrenica, dear people from the Podrinje region, dear friends!
The shots fired by the killers from the Special State Unit of Serbia “Scorpions“ in the back of the heads of the Srebrenica boys were also shots fired at the heart of contemporary civilization, the heart of the global order represented by the Dutch UN battalion’s blue helmets in the so-called “safe area“.
Innocence and helplessness of victims has probably been so obviously and clearly faced with such cold and merciless hatred of criminals, as well as with unprecedented and shameful indifference of powerful world leaders in the Nazi camps of the Hitler's Germany only.
Those who could have prevented the tragedy of Srebrenica, and of the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, failed to do so, thus failing a test in history.
Srebrenica will remain a dark spot on a cheek of most responsible factors within the international community.
We keep making our oath each year again and again, and this time we make it during the sacred month of Ramadan: we will never forget the victims of Srebrenica, nor shall we allow the shadows of lies to cover up and relativize the truth about the gravest suffering in our people's history.
We also know that, should there be a grain of earthly consolation for the mothers, sisters and daughters of Srebrenica, then such grain is the inevitability of justice that must reach the criminals.
Unfortunately, the victims have been waiting for justice for too long!
The key creator and commander Slobodan Milošević died in the Hague, while Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić often stage an inappropriate theatre show in the Scheveningen, thus mocking at the victims who survived.
Their followers, hundreds of direct executors and killers, still walk freely the streets in Bosnian towns, while defying justice and threatening the returnees.
The criminals must hear a clear message: we will never stop persecuting them. War crimes are not subject to the statute of limitations.
Furthermore, those who negate the genocide in Srebrenica must know that they thus commit a new crime, while siding themselves to the dark side of history.
Lies, provocations and ignoring of the truth must stop.
The genocide in Srebrenica is a crime of planetary dimensions. Not only ourselves, but the whole world must keep repeating that lesson, in the same manner in which we always keep repeating the lesson on the Holocaust.
For all of us, in each school in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this lesson must have particular importance.
The sooner we learn it, it will be easier for us to live on and follow the path of reconciliation to such future in which crimes will not be repeated.
We have no other path to follow.
Therefore, from this place, let me deliver a clear message: facing the complete truth on tragic events that took place at the end of the twentieth century, however difficult it may be for some, is a precondition for all reconciliation processes, stabilization and progress of the South Eastern European region.
Only the courageous, humane, responsible and honest leaders can lead such processes in a credible way.
Self-deceptions and ignorance, that are unfortunately still occupying some minds, will not bring about anything good to anyone.
Such attitudes may only be dangerous sources of new conflicts and violence.
Innocent victims of Srebrenica deserve the truth and peace. We accompany them to their final rest at this site, which should be an important remembrance symbol for the whole world, with the prayer “let Srebrenica never repeat itself to anyone“.
Thank you!"

Your Excellency Helen Clark,
Dear coordinator Mister Afanasiev,
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my pleasure to be here with you and open this lovely home of the United Nations in Sarajevo.
The presence of the United Nations Organisation in our country already lasts over two decades.
The United Nations have significantly assisted Bosnia and Herzegovina, through its various agencies and programme, and by addressing various needs of our population.
Unfortunately, the United Nations once did not pass the test in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica. The genocide was not prevented although the UN troops had the mandate and the obligation to do so.
The whole world saw this and the UN admitted their catastrophic mistake.
However, certain agencies of the United Nations greatly assisted our citizens. UNHCR, IPTF, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, ILO, and so on, have left a deep and positive mark on the development of our country and its civil society in the post conflict period.
We are grateful for that engagement which has lasted to this day and which will be administered from this building which we are officially opening today.
UNDP, that is the United Nations Development Programme, is particularly recognizable and accepted in the whole of our country.
With its various activities and projects, the United Nations is helping us employ people, strengthen the system of responsible governance, respect of human rights, employment, energetic efficiency, as well as to more expediently include the youth into the public, political and economic life of the country. It is due to the above mentioned that I am particularly pleased that we today have an opportunity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Sarajevo, to welcome you, Mrs. Clark!
The way you lead UNDP and the UN group for development is very impressive.
I wish you all the best to continue your engagement in building of better and more balanced developed world!
Moreover, I wish every success and all the best to the local UN staff which is continuing to work for the overall benefit of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you."

Your Excellencies,
Dear friends,
Assalamu alaikum and good evening,
As the patron of this manifestation, I am very pleased that we have an opportunity to host tonight the high ranking officials of the friendly countries of our region.
These days we have been marking, by a series of manifestations, 550 years since the date when one of the first documents on the protection of human rights in the history of humankind was issued. This document is the Adhnama of Sultan Mehmed Fatih, signed on 28 May 1463 in Milodraž in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It was by the Adhnama that the Sultan guaranteed the Franciscans peace, freedom, security and their return from places of refuge. It declared that it was prohibited to disturb or offend them, and ensured security to their monasteries and churches.
It is not easy from this distance and from the current perspective to accept and understand fully the greatness and significance of this document. We live in a modern, sovereign, democratic country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Nowadays our country albeit faced with many problems and challenges, is independent and free again, discrimination is prohibited by the law and the human rights must be respected.
On its path to the society of well organized European states, Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to deal with these issues with increasing intensity. It will continue to perfect itself and provide a better service to its citizens.
Perhaps it seems sometimes to someone that on that path there is no need to turn too much to the past, and that one’s sole focus should be the focus on the future. However, this is not so.
It is the responsibility of all of us to, from time to time, look back and express our deep respect to all those who interweaved their existence into the existence of Bosnia.
To those who, by means of their approach to equality of human beings, enabled creation of our multi-ethnic community which, in many ways, is a precursor of the current European spirit and unification.
Let us try to understand the time in which the Adhnama was written. At that time the conquerors did not pay attention to the collective rights of communities they would conquered. The only thing that mattered was the size of seized territories and prompt establishment of new governance. Enslaving was a common phenomenon.
Prior to the arrival of the Ottomans, Bosnia used to have its own independence and history, her specificity. The Franciscans used to have a very important and recognizable role in the Bosnian specificity and history. This has been the case to date, and will remain to be the case always. The Franciscans have been weaved into the complex multi-ethnic weft of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Sultan Mehmed El-Fatih was obviously aware of this fact, and thus decided to guarantee the Franciscans the right to live and act freely in the new circumstances. The text of the Adhnama which he signed says it all, and it does so in a very unambiguous language.
A documentary which we have seen provides a testimony for this, as well as for other aspects of the history of that time. I hereby express my gratitude to all those who worked on this film.
Of course, many Bosnians and Herzegovinians have mixed and ambivalent feelings regarding this period of our history as all of us who love this country are proud of its overall standing. We are also proud of the achievements of our mediaeval state, which vanished in those days before a mighty empire that, at that period, overflowed a huge portion of the world.
However, it is a historic fact that the time which the Ottomans spent in Bosnia and in the Balkans brought about centuries of peace and development of a unique multi-cultural identity that this country now has. We are proud indeed of that historical period of Bosnia and Herzegovina, too. The Ottoman component is simply an irreplaceable part of the formulae of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian identity and specificity.
Dear friends,
I sincerely hereby thank the organizers of tonight’s manifestation for an excellent job they have done!
I thank all of you for participating in tonight’s marking of the 550th anniversary of the Adhnama.
And I congratulate in advance the recipients of charters and letters of appreciation.
I wish you all the best!
Thank you!"
60243,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the 4th Sarajevo Business Forum,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60243&langTag=en-US,2013-05-17,"Your Excellencies,
Dear SBF participants,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear friends,
It is my great pleasure to be here today and extend welcome to you to this year's fourth Sarajevo Business Forum.
Let me, in particular, extend greetings to a great friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to a man who stood with the people of this country during its most difficult times, one of the world's greatest statesmen of the 20th century, Muhamed Mahatir. I also extend greetings to the former President of Slovenia Danilo Türk, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Ali Babacan, as well as His Excellency Humaid Obaid Al Tayer, Minister of Finance of the United Arab Emirates.
It is thanks to a hard-working team of organizers, led by Amer Bukvić, that Bosnia and Herzegovina and its capital have become an attractive site for investors from all over the world, and that this forum has grown into a truly nice tradition.
Here in the open, cosmopolitan city of Sarajevo, we have met and will continue to meet each other in order to do some good things, share experience and ideas, agree on valuable jobs in the interest of our countries and the people who entrusted us with their confidence.
Political leaders and entrepreneurs, or prime ministers, presidents and investors, bankers and managers should compose one team, which will play together in order to create new values, progress and advancement.
If the former are not responsible players, if they are more inclined to disputes and conflicts than to cooperation, dialogue and creation of a positive environment, then, of course, businessmen run away from them and look for other, more peaceful, stable and favourable sites to implement their business plans. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as our whole region in the South Eastern part of Europe, have slowly progressed to more peaceful political waters. A slogan “zero problems with neighbours“gets more likely to be implemented here in the Western Balkans, too, amongst the countries which were at war just some twenty years ago.
I met with the presidents of Serbia and Croatia Nikolić and Josipović last month, on Wednesday we will attend a tripartite meeting Serbia-BiH-Turkey, hosted by our distinguished host, President of Turkey Abdulah Gül, so that I will not exaggerate if I tell you that better days are ahead of us, for the countries of our region. It is by solving the Kosovo issue that, finally, curtains have been dropped over a difficult and painful period.
A rational conviction prevails in standpoints demonstrated by the key leaders in the region that only peace, mutual cooperation and stability may bring about a better future for all countries established following the break-up of former Yugoslavia. I am not saying that there will be no minor crisis in these relations. However, I am convinced that there is time filled with better news that will follow, and that we have reached a new highway which leads both Bosnia and Herzegovina and our neighbouring countries to stability and stronger economic progress.
Dear friends,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with scars that are still visible due to the late 20th century war. We are still passing through a period of crises and barriers on our European path. But, those who raise political ado, who look for their opportunity in new destructions and conflicts, disqualify themselves actually. They are like temporary thunderstorm. You will see, we will not remember them in a few years. Only courageous leaders with clear vision will bring about prosperity and a better future to both this country and the region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has got all necessary pre-requisites to become an equal member of the European family of states. From a comparative perspective, we have numerous potential advantages in relation to many other European countries. According to the recently published World Bank's surveys, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the first in the region and the seventh country in Europe by its water resources. This potential has not been utilized sufficiently, and we are yet to implement some major development projects in the electric power sector. In addition to this, with our rich fundamental resources – coal, wood, minerals, and even certain oil supplies – we should look for our opportunity in development of agriculture and tourism.
Let me remind you that we have implemented successfully the Turkish loan amounting to 100 million Euros through projects providing assistance to returnee population, primarily by investment into agricultural production. Therefore, I would like to extend my thanks once again to the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the Government of Turkey for this particularly important assistance to our country.
Infrastructural projects, certainly, have to be in the focus of all development projects, including, primarily, a continuation of construction of the motor road at the Corridor 5C. Things are going well on that issue, too, so that we expect an even stronger impetus in order to complete this traffic “spine“ of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the next few years.
In addition to all this, BiH has a long industrial tradition, educated people, responsible and relatively cheap labour force, high quality managers, proven constructors, innovators and engineers, stable currency pegged to Euro, companies relevant in the international context... What our governments at all levels must do, parallel to persistent and decisive fight against corruption indeed, is to remove all administrative obstacles that now hinder foreign investors and discourage potential entrepreneurs.
Dear Sarajevo Business Forum participants, dear guests,
With all its past and current problems, Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown an extraordinary vitality and strength to move forward, even though it has carried heavy weight on it legs. It has always been supported in this endeavour by its friends: those from the East and those from the West alike. Today's conference is an opportunity in which friends of our country and of our people, leaders who brought about miracles in economic reconstruction and progress of their countries will explain how they did it and thus help us create a similar, positive economic recourse in Bosnia and Herzegovina, too.
I extend my thanks to them for attending this conference, for their efforts, and for everything good that they have done for our country.
Thank you!"
60239,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the Sarajevo Halal Fair and Forum (SAHAF),https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60239&langTag=en-US,2013-05-16,"It is my distinct pleasure to, as the sponsor of this fair and forum, greet you and wish you successful future cooperation, and many new joint projects which will bring a concrete benefit to all, and represent Bosnia and Herzegovina in a new and positive light in international market places and global business circles.
Distinguished Excellencies, respected guests, participants, organisers, ladies and gentlemen,
It is my distinct pleasure to, as the sponsor of this fair and forum, greet you and wish you successful future cooperation, and many new joint projects which will bring a concrete benefit to all, and represent Bosnia and Herzegovina in a new and positive light in international market places and global business circles.
I am particularly honoured that this unique event is taking place under mine and the auspices of the esteemed Reis-ul-Ulema of the Islamic Community in BiH, H.E. Mr. Husein ef. KavazoviÄ‡.
Besides the cooperation between business people, academic and scientific institutions, as well as religious circles, a strong support of the institutions of government to such initiatives and projects represents key for success of this and every other positive project.
We are happy and proud that Sarajevo is a host to this important international manifestation which links business people, investors, academic and religious institutions, and companies and officials from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole world.
Alongside Sarajevo Business Forum, which Sarajevo has already become recognized for in the international business circles, I wish for SAHAF also to become a traditional manifestation which will offer opportunities and new possibilities for all of us.
Young, educated business people, the initiators of this project, have done an exceptional job in organizing a demanding event and I congratulate them.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has considerable potentials which can enable it to, in relatively short time, develop various industrial activities. Bosnia and Herzegovina can become a perfect connection place of business people from the East and the West.
We understand well the East and the West, as we are located on their crossroads and we share values and convictions of both. Here, any person with good intentions is appreciated and welcome.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is also the central part of wider region of South-East Europe and I see many participants and friends from the neighbouring countries who are attending this event, which represents a testimony and an impetus that we can and must cooperate better. The attendance by the guests and friends from the far countries testifies the fact that BiH is recognized in those countries as a state which has a lot to offer and which has positioned itself on the world map for the halal market place.
Along with the energy sector and investment into infrastructural projects, the halal industry represents a development potential which can significantly contribute to the process of integrations, economic and social development, and to the overall improvement in the quality of life of its citizens. For, halal food is the healthiest food which comes as a product of a completely controlled process of production.
Opportunities for doing business in the field of halal industry throughout the world are enormous. Potentials and demand increase daily.
I am convinced that SAHAF will contribute to the connection of certified halal producers and service providers from our regions with the greatest players in the leading world halal markets and will make them more visible and recognisable within the international framework.
Thank you."

Presidents,
Representatives,
Ministers,
Generals, officers, privates and civilians serving in the AF BiH,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Twenty-one years have passed since the Army of Republika Srpska was formed, and eight years since forming of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska). We are here today to mark those dates: the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) which nourishes the combat path and liberating traditions of the Serb people.
Gentlemen privates, NCOs, officers, Generals and civilians of the 3 Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), I congratulate you the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the Regiment, and I salute you with our traditional military salute: Pomo'z Bog, junaci! (God Bless Heroes!)
The Army of Republika Srpska was formed on 12 May 1992, with a fundamental aim of protecting the Serb people in BiH, in the areas where they have always lived, in the times of open and organized political and armed destruction of Yugoslavia, as a unique state in which the Serb people lived together with other peoples.
The forming of the Army of Republika Srpska was extorted by political circumstances which threatened repetition of the tragic suffering of the Serb people from the near past, and which too expensively was paid with human lives. The Army of Republika Srpska is political and military expression of the instinct for self-sustainability, collective defense of biological survival and preservation of the Republika Srpska, as political autonomy and self-management of the Serb people in BiH.
Eighteen years after the war in BiH ended, the destroyers of Yugoslavia publicly praise themselves for succeeding in destroying once mutual state of ours. In this flood of new publicity books, documentary and memoir archives of that time, today, open activities and action of various International and internal forces, which worked consciously and with plan on destroying the once mutual state of ours, emerge to the surface. Many of the politicians of those times and military commanders are now national heroes of their peoples and the states created, they seek for recognition for such politics of separatism and destruction. Those who consciously destroyed the mutual state and light the flames of inter-nation war conflicts, lament today over the consequences they caused, rejecting any kind of responsibility for the past events of war.
From the testimonies before The Hague Court and the domestic Courts in the cases of war crimes, undeniable facts which preceded the armed conflict in BiH are being revealed today. The process of armament and preparations for the war in Yugoslavia and BiH can be clearly seen from those facts. It is enough to remind ourselves of the fact that, before the recognition of BiH Independence, while still being the part of Yugoslavia, there had been more than 30 armed attacks and incidents on the Serb people and Yugoslav National Army, as the only regular and joint armed formation of the state in accordance with the Constitution and the laws in force.
Furthermore, we must not forget the facts that the armed formations of other two peoples in BiH had been formed before the forming of the Army of Republika Srpska, which is witnessed by the dates of their marking, which are being celebrated even today. We are not saying that to deny the right to political view of the events to others, bit for the reason of the Serb side having been tendentiously and maliciously attributed with sole responsibility for the destruction of the country and the beginning of the war. We do not deny rights to other people to political organization and self-defense, as nobody can deny those rights either. It is only that we will not let lies to be spread about the Serb people and the Army of Republika Srpska in the past war.
Today, when we are marking the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3 Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), we are both proud and sad. We are proud o live free and in peace in the Republika Srpska, for which the combatants of the Army of Republika Srpska fought for. At the same time, we are sad for many of them gave their lives in the past war and did not live to see the day of peace. Therefore, we honor them, with the due reverence and lasting memory. The Republika Srpska will never forget its people's army, fallen and missing soldiers and their families, because it is our patriotic, moral and social responsibility and duty.
The 3 Infantry Republika Srpska Regiment, in peace, proudly nourishes and guards the tradition of the Army of Republika Srpska and the glorious fights of the entire Serb people in the past. .
The courage, patriotism and knightly moral of the fighters of the Army of Republika Srpska, in the hard times for the Serb people, should be the role model for the members of the 3 Infantry Republika Srpska Regiment , yet to all young generations in the Republika Srpska.
The 3 Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) is a peacekeeping and defensive military component, directed towards defense and providing collective security, but if some think that for this reason, they will scare us with threats of disappearance of the Republika Srpska, by staging the so called „limited war“, they are wrong and are underestimating our readiness to defend the national identity and by the Constitution and Laws realized rights. We are sending a message to those that they should stop spreading hatred amongst peoples and new delusions to their own people, and that they should turn to progress, future and solving of the problems of people in everyday life.
We are of the opinion that, in BiH, we must avoid these misunderstanding at any price, try to solve the mutual problems and open questions through agreement, but at the same time we are sending this message from this place today, to all those who once again wish to cause conflict, mislead peoples and threaten with the destruction of the constitutional structure of the country, that we shall not let that happen, we shall defend our autonomy and people's elf-management, today, in peace, as we did in the past defensive-liberation war.
We marked the 9 May yesterday, the Day of Victory over the Fascism, which is celebrated as the Day of Europe. As a part of that heritage, we nourish three great European values today: antifascism, democracy and social, political and economic integrations. I wish to remind of the huge contribution of the Serb people to the anti-fascist fight and the victory of the Allies in the WWII, on basis of which the today's democratic and united Europe was built. We will not allow the belittling and minimizing of that contribution, as well as the malicious accusations of the entire Serb people, which come from individuals and groups which are followers of those forces which lost the war, and some of them openly supported the fascism.
We will not allow the political revision of unbeatable historical facts, which tell about the Serb suffering and their contribution to people's liberating fight and building of the modern Europe. We do posses enough of spiritual and intellectual power, knowledge and political power to confront the falsification of distant and near history for the purpose of daily-political needs and propaganda.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Several years ago, we approached to the reforms of military, security and defense sector in BiH, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Treaty, the process of the region stabilization and the peacetime needs of the country. As a result of the reforms, the 3 Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) was formed, a one of the three constituting components of the joint Armed Forces of BiH.
The AF BiH, in future, should be adjusted to economic capabilities of the country, sub regional stability and appreciation of possible security threats and challenges.
The AF BiH should be small, cheap and effective defense military organization, in accordance with the overall progress of the society, peace development, stability and the process of the European integrations.
In such organization, the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) shall find its position, not only as the unit continuing the military heritage of the Army of Republika Srpska, but also as an expression of the equality of the Serb people with the two Constitutive peoples in BiH and guaranty of its existence.
Thank you."

Respected families of Shaheeds and Combatants lost,
Dear Golden Lilies and carriers of the Gold Police Badge,
Dear friends, distinguished guests!
It is my tremendous honour and pleasure to be here with you today, the bravest people our Bosnia and Herzegovina has.
Many of you are my personal acquaintances and I firmly believe that to be my great treasure to be acquainted with you. Whenever we mark important dates from our recent history, hard and glorious, painful and honourable, our hearts are filled with pride, yet with grief too.
We are proud to have, even poorly armed and by many condemned to defeat, defended and saved our country, and fought for its bright future on the map of the free and democratic world.
It is with grief that we remember our brothers lost and the selfless and noble sacrifice they made. For centuries, the history has marked hard periods which our country went through; it has been marked with huge sacrifices and great heroes, but there had not been harder times for our country than those from the end of the 20th century. That is why the heroism of the best Bosnian-Herzegovinian sons in the Defensive-Liberation War 1992-1995 was historical and recognized all over the planet. We shall never forget our Shaheeds and Combatants lost.
The eternity belongs to them, and it is our obligation to leave the truth about them and their glorious fight a heritage for the generations to come.
The truth is that we stood up against the powerful machinery of the Yugoslav National Army, the Karadžić’s and Mladić’s murderers, and that in that day to day, month to month, year to year fight we were becoming stronger, more united and organized.
Bravely and wisely, the political leadership of the country, led by the War Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the people organised into units of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, led us to freedom and reaching a historical goal – the protection and preservation of sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We prevailed, with many sacrifices, and our glorious army did not lose its face.
Our fighters did not revenge, did not burn villages, and were not killing innocent civilians or destroying churches.
The single crimes committed we processed during the war, and we had the strength to settle accounts with some rebel units of our own.
That is true and we must not let this be diverted in an opposite direction. We must not allow the falsifiers and enemies relativise and equalise the crimes.
The light and darkness cannot be equalised.
We have been and we are remaining on the positive side of the history and we must preserve that priceless capital of ours for the future.
We are manifesting it strongly here today when we, as it was the case previous years, are marking the Golden Lily Day, 9 May, the Day of Victory over Fascism.
Dear friends,
I know you expect me, as a BiH Presidency Member, to share with you my view on the current political situation, and say a few words about what has been happening to us lately. We all witness the crisis that has lasted for too long, fruitless political fights, the wars of political parties, selfish fight for power on which huge energy is wasted.
It all brings the country backwards, and leads people to apathy and hopelessness.
Even our ally friends do not have an answer to this political masochism. The damages we are making to ourselves are huge. Investors run away from Bosnia and Herzegovina; corruption and crime have become profitable occupations. The worse is that people are slowly becoming used to such state.
I shall quote here one of our lucid journalists, who recently said: ”God forbid we were ‘united’ like this on 2 May 1992, the Yugoslav National Army would have walked into the Presidency Building.” Perhaps, these words are too strong, but we have to take them most seriously. That is why, here in Zetra today, I wish to say: Do not let yourself, being the best of us, be dragged into daily-political showdowns and the ruthless fight for power.
Those who spread lies, divisions and strife perhaps expect exactly that. Please remain being who you were during the toughest hardships: brave, decisive, persistent and devoted to the only goal, and that is, strong, prosperous, peaceful and free state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, comfortable to all its citizens and peoples.
When the goal is of the question, there should be no divisions; we have always been and must remain as one there.
We are all there one party only today too. And that is where we shall stay.
Dear fighters, my dear Lilies, dear carriers of the Gold Police Badge, I wish you all the best for the Golden Lily Day, the Day of Victory over Fascism.
God Bless all the noble Shaheed souls of Bosnia and Herzegovina and let it be the everlasting remembrance of the fighters lost in our Defensive-Liberation War.
Love and protect our only homeland – Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you!"

I thank the Republic of Croatia and the State of Qatar for making this possible and helping the construction of this structure in which Muslims will pray to God Almighty and promote the universal ethic values and morality so needed in today’s world.
Respected President Josipović, the Prime Minister Milanović, Minister Al-Kuweriri, Mayor Obersnel, distinguished Rais-Ul-Ulemma Imam Kavazović, Mufti Hasanović, citizens of Rijeka, dear believers;
Good day to you and As-salaam-o-alaikum!
I am truly happy to be here today attending this extraordinary event. I congratulate you on having built such an astounding mosque and the Islamic Centre. I thank the Republic of Croatia and the State of Qatar for making this possible and helping the construction of this structure in which Muslims will pray to God Almighty and promote the universal ethic values and morality so needed in today’s world.
I ask Minister Al-Kuweiri to convey salaams and expressions of our gratitude to Emir of Qatar Al-Thani for his personal engagement and contribution to the Rijeka Islamic Centre. The Centre’s conference facility will honour the name of this proven friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
We owe our gratitude to Mayor Vojko Obersnel and the citizens of Rijeka who, with open hearts, accepted and supported their Muslim co-citizens in their multi-decade long endeavour to build a mosque in this beautiful city.
___________________________________________
The messages we are sending from Croatia today bear historical weight and power to which the future generations will testify.
In particular, for the reason we are sending them jointly and sincerely only two months prior to the Republic of Croatia’s official becoming the EU Member.
I am using this occasion too, to congratulate the people of neighbouring and friendly Croatia on this enormous achievement.
I wish and believe that my country Bosnia and Herzegovina will become a part of the great European family of states at soonest.
The peoples and citizens of BiH deserve that, despite all the hardships they are facing on that path.
__________________________________________
Croatia is a good place for life of the Bosniak Muslims.
The way their status is solved can serve as an example to other European states.
They live here freely while majorly fulfilling their national and religious rights.
I am convinced that it shall be so in the future.
We, Muslims, believe in Ayet from the Holy Quran in which it stands that, “God created various peoples around the World for them to get to know each other.”
We know that in this world, we will continue living together, next to each other, or together, and thus it is completely wrong to tend to dominate over others.
Our diversities are our wealth, and in no way they are disadvantages. We should build our future on mutual respect.
Therefore, there is no better symbolism than this one today.
Being responsible people in the times we live in, we have an obligation to better understand each other, not to ignore one another and jeopardize; not to judge on the basis of prejudice, but to learn about each other with plenty of good will, respect and sincerity.
I believe that 1001 kilometre of the border between us, which soon will become the border between BiH and the EU, shall not be any kind of “iron curtain”, but that we will jointly fill that border with points of connection and a more intensive collaboration.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The today’s event, in its full positive symbolism, overcomes the context of relations of the two neighbouring states and sends the signals to the entire world, and in particular, our region after all the dramatic events from the recent past.
The past ten days have been marked with a new positive energy in the relations amongst the states of the South-East Europe.
I went to Belgrade last week, and I felt good will from key people in the highest authorities of Serbia; the will to move forward, to turn toward future, without swiping the truth about past under the carpet. We should give them support in that endeavour.
I am confident that we all together find ourselves at the new beginning and that the stability and prosperity will be the key points of the future relations in this part of Europe.
May God Almighty, and all the good people amongst us, continue giving support on the path of peace and cooperation.
Thank you!"

BiH was a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, in the two-year mandate, between 2009 and 2011.
Respected Conference participants,
Dear young friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I thank you for the invitation to open the International Youth Conference “Banja Luka – Model of the United Nations“, which gathers high school students from BiH, countries of the region and Europe, and at which you practice the best achievements of the UN. I am glad that Banja Luka joined the group of more than eighty cities from all over the world this conference is held in.
I am fully confident that this Conference will contribute not only to the affirmation of the subject you are going to discuss in the forthcoming days, but also to the promotion of the city of Banja Luka, the Republika Srpska and BiH.
The UN were founded after WWII, with an aim of preventing new conflicts amongst peoples and states, by standing for the peace, collaboration and peaceful coexistence of the countries, on the basis of collective security.
BiH, as a member of the UN, in accordance with its abilities provides its contribution to the work of the world organisation, obeying the international law and principles and good-neighbourly politics consistently. BiH was a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, in the two-year mandate, between 2009 and 2011.
BiH Armed Forces members take part in Peace Support Missions of the UN, in several areas of crisis in the world, and thus contribute maintain peace and stability in the world.
As a BiH Presidency Member, I took part in the work of the UN General Assembly and Security Council , and I wish to share with you couple of impressions. The last time it was several days ago, when I participated in the Debate on the role of the International Criminal Justice in reconciliation.
The UN is often the subject of various criticisms by individuals and member states, for its inefficiency, sluggishness at work and is accused of failing to prevent certain conflicts in the past. That is where many demands for the reforms of this Organisation come from, and they have been coming for years. I believe that conferences like this one can contribute, not only to becoming familiar with the work of the UN, but to enhancing its work. However, with all its weakness, it is enough only to imagine what the world would look like without the UN. This World Organisation represents the widest international forum, where all the member states can, in a democratic discussion, deliver their problems and contribute to peace and stability in the world.
Lastly, I wish you successful work at the Conference, pleasant stay in Banja Luka; get to know each other and socialise, and in that way contribute to the values and ideals of the UN and the entire human kind.
Having said that, I proclaim the International Conference „Banja Luka – Model of the United Nations“ open.

Dear archive workers,
Respected guests,
ladies and gentlemen!
I am deeply honoured to be out in a position to deliver an introductory speech at this observation by which, in addition to other accompanying manifestations, we mark the 60th anniversary of organized archival activity in the Republika Srpska.
Let me, on behalf of the Organizational Board in charge of marking of this anniversary, extend my warmest greetings to you, and thank you for responding to our invitation, and for attending this observation, which presents only one in a series of manifestations dedicated to marking this great jubilee for archivistics and for the Archive of the Republika Srpska.
At the beginning, I would like to congratulate hereafter all archive workers of the Republika Srpska, as well as the management and employees of the Archive of the Republika Srpska for this great jubilee, and to wish them a lot of success in the future work. One of the proofs of their dedicated work includes yesterday's award they received from the President of the Republika Srpska, i.e. they were awarded the Medal of Njegoš of the First Order for special achievement in the area of public activities.
Sixty years of work and existence represents a respectable anniversary for any cultural establishment and institution even in such environments that are larger than Banja Luka and the Republika Srpska.
As the Chairperson of the Presidency of BiH, I accepted to provide my patronage for this important jubilee and anniversary, not only due to my personal commitment to the Archive of Republika Srpska and to arshivistics as an important social activity but, first of all, due to the fact that I am aware of the importance that the Archive of the Republika Srpska has had and should have in the future in the area of preservation of identity and self-awareness of the Serb people and of the Republika Srpska as a social and political community.
While chairing the Organizational Board for marking of the 60th anniversary of organized archival activities in the Republika Srpska, we aimed, by means of a number of symbolic manifestations, including the today's one, to present the previous work of the Archive of the Republika Srpska, new projects and plans, as well as to provide adequate social and political treatment of this important activity in preservation of a collective memory, as well as of identity of the people and of the state.
Let me avail myself of this opportunity to extend my gratitude to all those who helped us organize marking of this important anniversary, and thus familiarize ourselves better with the sixty-year old organized archival activity in the area of the Republika Srpska.
My promise necessarily contains a subjective note, given that I spent a large part of my working career in the Archive of the Republika Srpska. Such important anniversary cannot be marked without us reminding ourselves of some significant people, dates, events and decisions.
Prior to establishment of public archival institutions and archival services, written data and service books were kept by public institutions and societies, awhile organized storage was provided by museums and libraries.
Organization of storage, gathering, processing and protecting of archival records started 60 years ago, by the Decision on Establishment of the Archive of the City of Banja Luka, passed by the People's Board of the City of Banja Luka on 20 April 1953. Three years later, the Archive of the City of Banja Luka, pursuant to the Approval issued on 30 May 1956 by the Executive Council of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, grew into the County Archive of Banja Luka. Pursuant to the decisions passed by the county assemblies of Banja Luka and Bihać, the Archive of Bosanska Krajina was established in Banja Luka in mid-1963. This archive, in terms of its territorial mandate, was covering 23 municipalites of the Bosanska Krajina region. It was the largest regional archive in the socialist Yugoslavia.
Due to the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in spring 1992, the Government of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed its decision on establishment of the Archive of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state-owned public institution based in Sarajevo.
Pursuant to the Law on Ministries of 1993, the Archive of the Republika Srpska was defined as a Republic administrative organization conducting administrative and expert tasks in the area of archival activities.
Today's Archive, with its status of the Republic Administrative Organization within the Ministry of Education and Culture in the Government of the Republika Srpska, is a central institution for protection of cultural assets.
On the occasion of marking of this jubilee, we should not forget to mention some important people who left an indelible trace in archival activities of the City of Banja Luka and of the Republika Srpska. We owe our deep gratitude for the status of the Archive and of archivistics in the Republika Srpska to Milan Vukmanović, Dušan Vržina, Verica Stošić, Dušan Popović, and other employees in this area of work.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We have just remindered ourselves of most important activities, difficulties and successes we have had in the last sixty years.
We live in the time in which our historical and archival heritage is subject to various interpretations and misuse that fall beyond the scope of archival and historiographic professional skills and profession. It is the task of archive workers and of archives as public institutions of special importance to, through their work, promote truth and scientific approach in treatment and presentation of archival records and documents on events from our past. There are many remaining subjects from the past of the Republika Srpska and BiH that have not been researched yet, and it is on these subjects that our archives should provide access and research. It is very important that all administrative levels in the Republika Srpska, in accordance with their possibilities, provide support and invest into this form of public presentation of our archival treasure, by which they also contribute to international promotion of archival institutions from the Republika Srpska, as well as to the international promotion of the Republika Srpska herself.
In a few moments we are about to open the exhibition of archival documents entitled “The Archival Treasure of the Republika Srpska“. The exhibition of archival documents “Jovan Dučić in Diplomacy“ was opened yesterday. These exhibitions resulted from shared efforts and cooperation of archival workers and all archives in the Republika Srpska and in Serbia. The aim of these exhibitions is to present to both professional and wider public the richness of our archives, but also to promote our work and archival profession. I am glad that those who love our cultural and historical heritage and archival assets, experts and our citizens alike, will be able to see these two exhibitions in the next few days and thus familiarize themselves with our archival treasure. That is why I believe that there will be more similar exhibitions in the future in other cities and places in the Republika Srpska.
Finally, with my congratulations for good and committed work, as well as for a socially justified and important role and function in preservation and protection of our collective cultural, national and identity-related goods and values, let me, once again, wish you a lot of success in the future work, and let me wish you to keep achieving good results in what you do and know best."

In that sense, it is necessary to further strengthen direct contacts between BiH companies and interested Austrian companies.
THE PERSPECTIVES OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN BiH AND AUSSTRIA
Mister Chairman,
Dear businesspeople,
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is a great pleasure that I am able to see and greet the businesspeople of BiH and Austria in one place. These two countries have good, friendly and stable political relations, which I will confirm today in the meeting with President Fischer. That is an excellent basis for furthering of economic, trade, cultural and other relations and connections between our countries, businesspeople and citizens. That is why I am pleased to see today in Vienna the businesspeople from BiH, that is, from both of its entities – the Republika Srpska and the Federation BiH, and Austria, who can review and develop new opportunities for cooperation.
Why a Business Forum of businesspeople of the two countries, here and now?
Bosnia and Herzegovina is traditionally linked with the Austrian market, particularly bearing in mind the fact that a large number of BiH citizens live and work in Austria. In addition, Austria represents one of the most significant investors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is evident that there is a great interest for economic cooperation between BiH and Austria. In that sense, it is necessary to further strengthen direct contacts between BiH companies and interested Austrian companies.
Austria is one of the most significant foreign trade partners of BiH; it is among top ten partner countries. Austria, with the total of 1,2 billion Euros, is the largest investor in BiH, ahead of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. There are around 400 Austrian companies and 200 branches of Austrian companies which operate within the BiH marketplace. Austria is an important trading partner to BiH, and it is one of the rare countries with which we are achieving a trade surplus, or at least, we have a balanced trade exchange. For BiH, Austria is on the fifth place as an export trade partner and on the eighth place as an import trade partner.
At this moment, many European countries are preoccupied with the economic crisis which is a threat to stability of our economies and societies. According to the general information available, Austria is being more successful than some other countries, in coping with the consequences of this crisis. That is one more reason why Austrian experiences and economic solutions should serve as a successful model.
I will briefly describe the economic trends in BiH in the last few years:
In the year of 2012 a fall of 0.5% GDP was noted, so that 2012 can be marked as the year of economic stagnation of BiH. That is a direct consequence of additional deepening of the crisis in the Euro zone and other countries, the main foreign trading partners of our county, as well as the insufficient economic activity in the country. It is encouraging that, in 2012, direct foreign investments continued to grow and they surpassed significantly the previous years. The overall value of the foreign investment inflow in 2012 in BiH amounted to 508 million Euros, which is a lot closer to the amounts which had been marked prior to the start of the crisis. Unfortunately, high and constant unemployment, transitional poverty, large and non-effective public sector and a small scale of real economy, are the greatest weaknesses of the BiH economy.
According to the Austrian indicators, BiH is an attractive destination for investments by Austrian companies, which is shown by the constant widening and growth of investment in the recent years. Austria has invested 22.2% of all investments to BiH from 1995 to 2011.
The major investment of Austria in BiH is within the banking sector. There are currently four Austrian banks operating in BiH. By its significant presence in the BiH banking sector, Austria shows interest in participation in the process of economic transition in BiH. Austrian investors are interested in investments in the construction, building of transport infrastructure and energy sectors.
It is assessed that opportunities for joint investments in the production sector have not been sufficiently used, together with the development of spa, sport and leisure and all other kinds of tourism, as well as exploration and the use of natural resources. Due to similarity in configuration of the terrain of the two countries, it would be good to exchange experience in the field of planning, development and joint investments of road, as well as rail transport. Only on the basis of joint investments, in the field of wood, chemical, textile and plastics processing, is it possible to make a more significant step forward in the maintenance of the foreign trade balance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Allow me to give a few recommendations which can assist in better economic cooperation of our countries.
The investment climate in BiH, due to the global economic crisis and complicated rules and procedures is still unfavourable for many parties, therefore, for the Austrian investors also. This is why the local authorities have undertaken activities to simplify the existing administrative procedures for issuing of necessary permits for the work of companies, with an aim of easier and speedier investments.
Furthermore, electronic signature documents are still not recognised in BiH, which leads to many difficulties in doing business and goods exchange between the two countries, but, we are aware of this need, and we are working on its legislative regulation.
As far as the trade and goods exchange is concerned, it is necessary to increase the diversification of goods exchange.
I believe that the greater participation of Austrian companies in the process of privatisation of our local companies could be one of the fields of concrete cooperation to mutual interest. BiH has a need for new foreign investments in various fields of economic activity. BiH offers great opportunities for foreign investments in the fields of energy, agriculture, metallurgy, processing industry, tourism, local infrastructure, traffic and communications and many others. I am of the opinion that the structure of Austrian investments in BiH should include more investments in production sectors, and not only the service, financial and similar branches as has been the case to date.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a signed Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation, Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments, as well as an Agreement on Social Insurance with the Republic of Austria. In the following period it is necessary to review what other agreements are necessary between the two countries, so that the economic cooperation is improved, then prepare those and suggest those to the Government of Austria and the Government of the Council of Ministers of BiH.
Finally, I once more praise the holding of this Business Forum today, and expect to make another similar meeting in BiH too, and above all, I express hope that this kind of cooperation of the business people of the two countries will continue in the future, to overall benefit of our economies, your employees and all citizens.
I wish you successful meetings during this Business Forum, and many new ideas and projects of mutual cooperation.
Thank you."

Respected families of shaheeds,
Dear residents of Ahmići,
Esteemed Mufti Abdibegović,
Respected guests!
Es-selamu aleikum!
Today we have gathered to once again mark a sorrowful anniversary, to remember 116 residents of Ahmići, murdered 20 years ago, and to, in front of their graves and this shaheed monument, repeat that their sacrifice will never be forgotten.
Our murdered sisters, mothers, daughters, grandfathers, brothers and fathers, the innocent boys murdered, and the youngest victim, a three month old child in a cradle, are today in our thoughts and prayers, and our deepest sympathy is with their closest ones, their families, neighbours and friends.
Our truth is imprinted with the blood of the innocent, and it is permanent and indestructible, as is our centuries-long Bosnia and Herzegovina.
No matter how much effort its enemies make to destroy it.
Perhaps some of those who do not love this country wish for us to tire, to start leaving all to oblivion, to fall into their trap and say: fine, those are general knowledge things, in the name of the future and reconciliation among peoples we will not remember again.
But here also, in Ahmići, and all other places of our suffering, we repeat: we will never allow that.
We will gracefully and forever keep remembering, and carry the memory onto our children and grandchildren, keep from oblivion our own painful and hard, but honourable history.
Because, those who say that people who forget are condemned for the painful and tragic experience to repeat, are right.
But, we must also say the following: we do not remember so that we could take revenge.
We do not call for revenge or new bloodshed.
Absolutely not.
Our messages are clear, our intentions also.
We wish that Ahmići, Srebrenica, Kozarac, Foča, Višegrad, Zvornik, Bratunac, Vlasenica, Stolac, Brčko and all other toponyms of evil and crime, genocide and extradition in which innocent Bosniak people suffered during the aggression on our state from 1992 to 1995, never happen to anyone again.
My dear people of Ahmići!
I know you wish for the perpetrators and their chiefs responsible for the slaughter in your village be deservedly punished.
I also know that you have not received good news of this happening to an extent in which the justice is served and your pain at least somewhat subdued.
But, we will not give up.
War crimes do not become obsolete and we will not allow the perpetrators to rest.
We will continue to pursue them.
We should, all together, believe that the justice is reachable, have faith in our courts, as by believing that, we believe in our state which we are building through a lot of hardship and painful compromise.
And believe that the God’s judgment is final. Nobody can run away from that!
And in the end, I wish to tell you only a few more sentences.
I was in Živinice yesterday. We solemnly marked the Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 15 April, our glorious and honourable Army!
I will repeat here what I had said to our soldiers.
The organization of our people into the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the greatest achievement which shall be remembered by all future generations of patriots of this country.
This was always pointed out by our first President and Supreme Commander Alija Izetbegović.
The history teaches us that peoples and states lose battles and wars – even when they have the best of weapons – if they do not have a justified cause, the power of conviction and internal unity.
This message we must always bear in mind.
We must be united, strong and organized.
Discourage tyrants with own strength.
Only then, we can defend from assaults our beautiful country and ensure prosperous future for the generations ahead.
Thank you!"
60204,Speech by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina From the Republic of Srpska H.E. Mr. Nebojsa Radmanovic 67th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Thematic Debate ‘Role of,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=60204&langTag=en-US,2013-04-11,"Bosnia and Herzegovina /hereinafter BiH/ has welcomed the establishment of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, as a legal framework for ending the tragic period for all the peoples of BiH. After the war, the BiH authorities have consistently and constructively cooperated with the Hague prosecution and the Tribunal, which was positively assessed in the relevant periodic reports and the documents of the United Nations.
Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the beginning I would like to express my gratitude to the President of the United Nations General Assembly for initiating the idea to convene the General Assembly thematic debate on the role of the International Criminal Justice in reconciliation that is getting more importance in the years after its establishment and instigate different views particularly in the countries and the regions for which the special international tribunals have been established.
I am honored to thank the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his last visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region and especially for the support expressed on that occasion.
Three years ago the 65th anniversary of the famous Nuremberg process was marked, where the perpetrators of the most serious war crimes from the Second World War were prosecuted, which have established several legal precedents still being the integral parts of the international law by having become an inspiration for all the subsequent trials at the international level.
Twenty years have passed after the establishment of the first ad hoc Tribunal in the international relations and the tenth anniversary of entering into force of the Rome Statute by which the first permanent International Criminal Tribunal in Hague was established. The fact that the United Nations decided to create several ad hoc, hybrid and special tribunals, confirmed the determination of this world organization to ensure peace, security and respect for human rights in the world, by criminal prosecution of all the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is not easy to answer whether the twenty years is enough time to review its real effects especially on the reconciliation of the people, which are difficult to determine. Transitional ad hoc international criminal tribunals are relatively new legal mechanism in the international relations to enable rendering a final and decisive evaluation of their work and effects.
Bosnia and Herzegovina /hereinafter BiH/ has welcomed the establishment of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, as a legal framework for ending the tragic period for all the peoples of BiH. After the war, the BiH authorities have consistently and constructively cooperated with the Hague prosecution and the Tribunal, which was positively assessed in the relevant periodic reports and the documents of the United Nations.
BiH is strongly committed to process all the crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to have the perpetrators punished accordingly by the courts.
Trials for the war crimes committed in BiH, are being carried out at several levels: international, before the special international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, at the courts of the third countries in accordance with the universal jurisdiction principle, at the state and local level before the local courts. The Hague Tribunal has undertaken to process the most sensitive and complex war crimes cases and some less complex and sensitive were assigned to the different levels of the domestic judiciary for further processing.
With the goal of strengthening the processing of war crimes committed during the war in BiH, in 2003 and 2004, special departments for war crimes of the BiH Court and the Prosecutor's Office were formed. National Strategy for War Crimes was developed and adopted by BiH. So far, the country has made significant progress in processing war crimes. According to the national and the international organizations statistics, there still is large number of war crimes that should be processed before the domestic courts.
Before we start the discussion about this complex and delicate issue we must ask ourselves: Why was the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia established? The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in Hague was established with the principal intention to prosecute the perpetrators of the worst war crimes in the former Yugoslavia thus preventing any future occurrence of such events, with clear and resolute message that such actions will be punished consistently and without exception. The ICTY was established to determine the individual guilt of all the perpetrators of the most serous war crimes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and prevent the collectivization of the guilt to the whole population, ethnic and national communities. There is no collective guilt, but only the individual one. Whole nation cannot be blamed for the crimes committed by some individuals on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
The priority task of the international criminal court should be simultaneous exercise of justice by punishing the war criminals and satisfaction of the victims’ rights, which should contribute to reconciliation among the peoples.
Establishing the truth in the events in BiH and providing justice for the victims of the war should prevent any kind of historical vengeance and retaliation which may come from any group or ethnic community in the country.
Did the court fulfill its duty from the Security Council Resolution? Did some Tribunal’s rulings further traumatize the victims thus having us departed from the ultimate goal: reconciliation through justice for all? Does ICTY with its verdicts return in the past or lead to the future and reconciliation of the people? These are all difficult and complex issues to which we today, I am afraid, cannot give complete and clear answer.
The evaluations of thus far ICTY work and its effects to the process of reconciliation in BiH, are still being done burdened by the increasing political tension within the country and current interethnic mistrust, therefore it is still difficult to bring an objective assessment of its work. The dissatisfaction with some of the ICTY verdicts is present among all three constituent peoples in BiH, as well as the victims of the war. This dissatisfaction is particularly intensified after the latest three acquittals by the ICTY in cases against the Croatian generals, one member of the Albanian paramilitary units from Kosovo and the Chief of Staff of the FR Yugoslavia Army Headquarters.
In my capacity as the Chairman of the tripartite Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina representing the Serbs but also, by the nature of my duty, all three constituent peoples and all the BiH citizens, I must say before this eminent world organization event, that we in BiH, the political representatives of the various peoples, the public and the citizens respectively, have different opinions of the ICTY work. The opinions and views are directly related to the perception the individuals and entire ethnic communities have towards certain verdicts of the Court and its overall activity. Generally speaking, many people in BiH are dissatisfied with the Tribunal’s work and consider their victims are not treated fairly, and that only the perpetrators from their own people are punished. However, there is something we all have in common: the perseverance for all the crimes committed during the war to be prosecuted, the perpetrators punished, and the community satisfied with a sense of justice and the victims’ rights.
There is the widespread perception among the public and the most Republic of Srpska officials that the ICTY is selective and discriminatory against the Serbs convicted before this Court. Among the Serbs people in BiH, some ICTY verdicts have created the sense that they were victims of the Hague Tribunal, apart from having been the victims of the war, as well as the members of other peoples in Bosnia.
The largest paradox of the Hague verdicts is that majority of the Serbs believe that the ICTY has tried only the Serbs people, while, on the Bosniak side, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the high sentences rendered in the cases of the war crimes tried.
Several acquittals having contained a long term sentence in the first instance proceedings were completely overruled after the revision. This has opened the question of how it is possible to completely overrule such judgment and how such judgments contribute to the objectivity and impartial credibility of the court and to what extent they challenge its expertise, objectivity and fair intentions. These acquittals reduce confidence into the overall international criminal justice and judicial system.
The most common complaints and comments from the public on the work of the ICTY are: disproportional sentences, double criteria in the procedure for the same offenses, the selectivity towards the indicted, negative attitude towards the plea agreement on the admission of guilt, overruling of complete sentences to the individuals having been sentenced long-term in the first instance proceedings, without clear indication of who would be responsible for the documented and proven crimes in these and many other cases. ‘The proportionality strategy’ being likely to impose by the Hague Tribunal is unacceptable for all in BiH, but for different reasons, which indicates that we are still far from a unified opinion and view of what happened in our recent past.
In the BiH public there are different interpretations of the events from the war in BiH. There are also manipulations regarding the number of victims and obstructions from the different levels of government and the political elite related to obtaining the facts and documentation of the committed war crimes circumstances. All this is burdening the completion of the extensive and complex engagement of transitional justice as the legal framework for recovery of the war-split society.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
How can the so-far work of the Hague Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia contribute to prevention and deterrence of the future conflicts and crimes, ensure the rights of victims and help the process of reconciliation in the countries that were involved in the local conflicts?
One of the ways to achieve that is to provide researchers and experts the access and insight into the existing archives of the Hague Tribunal, so that everyone has complete written sources from all sides related to the war events in order to get an overall impression of what happened, rather than having just one-sided view of the events. Long lasting peace and reconciliation among the BiH peoples cannot be obtained only by rulings of any court. Reconciliation of the peoples, after such violent conflict, is a process requiring a broad and comprehensive effort of all social and political factors in a society to create the preconditions for true reconciliation. To do so, it is necessary to have an open and honest dialogue of the different actors, government structures, civil society, organizations and associations of the victims and veterans, at all levels, in order to overcome the difficult legacy from the past. One of the ways to overcome this is the inter-ethnic dialogue, particularly between young generations through educational projects on human rights and peace activism. We are encouraged by the more noticeable trend of constructive dialogue and cooperation between the representatives of the associations of victims from different peoples in BiH.
We have set the high and honorable goals - punish all the perpetrators of the worst crimes and violations of international law and the legal system in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Whether we succeed in that, depends not only on the international community and individual countries, but also on every human being and individual thus the civil society in general.
Thank you."
41926,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the ceremony of marking the Day of the Armed Forces of BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41926&langTag=en-US,2012-11-28,"We will build the Armed Forces which are capable and ready to efficiently answer to all security and defence challenges, risks and threats – a modern, mobile and well-equipped, educated and motivated army, which fulfils all NATO standards. In order to achieve this final goal, we must continue with the reform activities and with the realization of obligations within the framework on the NATO integration process.
Dear Commander Milojčić, dear soldiers, generals, officers, NCOs, dear guests!
It is my great pleasure and honour to congratulate all members of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the citizens of our country, 1 December – the Day of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today we are marking the 7th anniversary of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and we can proudly say that the defence reform is exactly our greatest success in the last 17 years. And the key achievement of this reform is the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Your commitment and efforts which you put in into this process were of critical significance. Our competent foreign friends marked the progress Bosnia and Herzegovina made in the defence reform as the greatest achievement which a candidate country for NATO accession made in such a relatively short time period. Especially taking into account the initial circumstances in which it was when it started the process of integration to NATO.
However, we have recently been witnesses of more open attacks on the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, bringing into question its sustainability, undermining its central institutions, attempts to reverse the reached degree of progress, to nullify the results of painstaking reforms. One of such attempts relates also to the defence reform through publicly expressed request for repeal of the Armed Forces of BiH and demilitarization. We who are building the future of this country and care about peace and security of its citizens will never agree to this. We will make even greater efforts to finish the job we started.
We will build the Armed Forces which are capable and ready to efficiently answer to all security and defence challenges, risks and threats – a modern, mobile and well-equipped, educated and motivated army, which fulfils all NATO standards. In order to achieve this final goal, we must continue with the reform activities and with the realization of obligations within the framework on the NATO integration process.
We are aware that the progress of this process now crucially depends on the fulfillment of the Talin condition for the Membership Action Plan. We are committed to enter the military property on the basis of agreement. We recently had a very significant Decision of the Constitutional Court, in which it was clearly stated that the state is the exclusive owner of state property, thus, and those 63 locations which the Presidency defined as prospective for the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That Decision removed all legal doubts relating to this issue, and I believe that it will significantly ease and speed up the fulfillment of the Tallinn condition, and that we will enter the military property very soon, and as a result get a green light to start our Membership Action Plan.
However, regardless of that dynamic, we surely have to continue with the reform processes and further the organizational structure, work and functionality of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence, as that is in our interest.
I wish to clearly send the following message: the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina do not exists only because we wish to become a NATO member state. They exist and will continue to exist because they are needed to Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens. They are an instrument of sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Armed Forces are a guarantee of security and defence of our country. Therefore they will exist and more all the more efficient, strong and more functional.
We have to pay attention and invest considerable funds, especially for the procurement of equipment and technical resources which are necessary for the Armed Forces to execute its duties and obligations. That particularly refers to offering assistance to citizens and civil authorities during natural disasters, as well as the building of secure environment, which we were a witness to this year. Despite limited resources and often inadequate technical resources, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina showed and proved this year, through its efforts, commitment and professionalism, that they are indispensable partner to citizens and civil authorities in reaction to natural and other disasters, execution of demining operations, search operations, savings and medical transport as well as engineering works.
Immense is your contribution to the affirmation of our country at the international scene. Thanks to you and your participation in international peace-building support missions, Bosnia and Herzegovina grew from the recipient of security assistance, to an actor which actively contributes to global security. Spanning from Democratic Republic Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Iraq, to Afghanistan, BiH Armed Forces gained trust and respect of allies and showed our country in a positive light.
And this is why we are obliged to, in every opportunity, reaffirm your role and significance, and to ensure that each day, the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina grow stronger and better. With strong Armed Forces, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also strong and safe.
Thank you!"

Dear Excellencies, respected guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
Thank you for coming to, together with us, officially mark 25 November, the Sovereignty Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today, as is the case with all previous years, we remember with pride and gratitude one generation which in the faithful times stood on the right side of history.
The generation which built its rock to BiH's unquestionable lasting and existence at its First Assembly of ZAVNOBiH in Mrkonjić Grad, on 25 November 1943.
It is important to remind again that the founding Decision of ZAVNOBiH Bosnia and Herzegovina was defined as the state of all its citizens and equal peoples – Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks – then the Muslims – as well as the members of other peoples and ethnic groups.
The sovereignty of BiH, and all important decisions of the First Assembly of ZAVNOBiH, are historically confirmed in the time that followed.
An extremely important document in defining the full sovereignty of BiH also represents the Declaration on the Rights of the Citizens in BiH, which was adopted at the Second Assembly of ZAVNOBiH, a year later, in Sanski Most.
Regulations of this Declaration are in full consent with the modern European standards of protection of freedom of a person and a citizen.
As a reminder, the Declaration on the Rights of a person in BiH guarantees: the freedom of religion, freedom of choice and agreement, associations and press, personal and property security of citizens, freedom of private initiative, as well as equality of women and men.
The confirmation of continuation of the country and the state, the confirmation of equality of people who live in it – those two are the spirit and the letter of ZAVNOBiH. And those are the basic ideas which should always gather again all those who wish well to the peoples and citizens of BiH.
Unfortunately, 17 years after the end of the conflict in our country, some of those who can significantly influence the situation in it, are not ready to come, and together with us confirm these founding values.
On the contrary, some of them more openly and impertinently bring into question the accomplished level of positive reforms, functioning of institutions, as well as the integrity and the future of BiH.
Politicians who will last around a decade think they can bring into question the state which lasts a thousand years. Their anxiety and impertinence are a clear sign of weakness and awareness of own transience. They know that there will be Bosnia – with or without them.
Peace, territorial integrity, survival of BiH, are guaranteed by the superpowers, signatories of the Dayton Peace Agreement; these are also guaranteed by the BiH state institutions, but, before all, they are guaranteed by increasing mass of ordinary people, benevolent citizens in every part of this country.
These are guaranteed by the people who are tired of those who shed evil, hate, fear, xenophobia, from those who call for further divisions, and with it, inevitably, new conflicts.
The time is not on the side of those who stall and destruct progress. They will grow tired. We who build and promote this country will not tire.
The future is on the side of peace and reintegration. It is on the side of all those who love their native soil, those who want for their children to be educated in a stable, prosperous and free state, an equal member of the EU.
We will devotedly continue to work for such future.
We will not agree to oblivion. We will be marking the Sovereignty Day. We will cherish the idea of anti-fascism, universal human rights and freedoms. We will keep the memory of brave and noble predecessors, of their acts which brought light to the darkest moments of history.
We shall fight for BiH to be the country of free and equal peoples. The country in which nobody will suffer or be endangered because of its faith, nation, political opinion or convictions.
On that note, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I congratulate you 25 November, the Day of Sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"

Dear friends of boxing,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The Boxing Club “Slavia” tonight with pride celebrates its 50 golden years, and the Boxing Federation of the Republika Srpska its two decades of existence and work, just like our Republika Srpska.
Both jubilees are for the sporting pride and long memory. However, jubilees are not only there to remind of the years and decades, but to, before all, keep from oblivion the people who, with their selflessness and enthusiasm wrote the best sporting and boxing pages of Banja Luka, as well as this part of the Balkans and Europe.
All that together gives a new dimension to the boxing mission as a noble skill in this region, and it gives “Slavia” a note of recognition of Banja Luka, Republika Srpska and the whole region.
Thank you to Slavia and all those who proudly and boldly wore its kit in the past decades.
The Boxing Club “Slavia” enters the sporting arena of Banja Luka at the end of the 1950s. In November 1959, under this name, in the Factory “Rudi Čajavec” as part of the sporting society “Slavia”, a boxing section was formed. It was the time when the sport of Banja Luka becomes recognisable in the Yugoslav frameworks, thanks to excellent handball players who were led by: Jerolim Karadža, Petar Pero Popović, Vladimir Jović, brothers Stanivuković, who soon also became Yugoslav representatives.
The Football Club “Borac” sought its place in the Yugoslav premium football, and in the year 1960, as the representatives of Yugoslavia, Banja Luka men, Tomo Knez and Velimir Veljo Sombolac became the Olympic winners.
“Slavia” found its place in such society. The real place. The founders of the boxing sport in Banja Luka were, before others, Gojko Krstanović, as well as Muhamed Šehić, Momo Novaković, Duško Smiljanić, Zdravko Torbica and others. The first competitors were the boxing novices: Ćutković, Milanović, Terzić, Mustedanagić, Batar, Latkovac, as well as the ten competitors of the Military Club “Petar Drapšin“ Babić, Veljić, Harbaš, Butić and others.
The trainings used to be held in the basement of the hotel “Rudi Čajavec“ on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and lasted for an hour. Friendly matches were held. At the beginning of June 1961 it was agreed to form the Boxing Club “Slavia”, and on 25 June 1961, a founding session of the Club was held. Žiža Ostojić, a director of “Rudi Čajavec”, was chosen to be the first president, and members of the committee were: Gojko Krstanović, Jovica Cvijetić, Mišo Bogdanović, Duško Josipović, Muhamed Kapetanović, Mile Babić, Milomir Gligorić, Boro Tadić, Muhamed Šehić and Duško Smiljanić, and on behalf of the competitors, Dragan Batar.
The matches were held at the stadium of sporting games, and when the weather conditions did not permit that, boxers also moved to the movie theatre “Rudi Čajavec”. Very soon “Slavia” became the sporting pet of the city, and the friendly matches used to be attended by more than a thousand fans.
As soon as the competition in the Republican League of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed, “Slavia” became a member of that league, and its best boxers attended tournaments in Belgrade and Sarajevo. The members of the best team of “Slavia” in that period were: Ćutković, Milanović, Terzić, Andrić, Harbaš, Lajić, Avdić, Vulin, Latkovac, Veljić and Batar.
From year to year, “Slavia” grew stronger and more organised, and the basement rooms of the hotel became too small to accommodate young men who came to train.
The greatest champion of the club was Dragan Batar, who in the year of 1962 was on the list of the best sports persons of Bosanska Krajina came fifth, and five years later the same was accomplished by Satko Glamoč.
During the seventies, under the leadership of Sredoje Zekanović, “Slavia” grows into an excellent team and in 1972 it becomes the Yugoslav first league club. The core of the team comprises Tešić, Pejić, Glamoč, Batar, and Marijan Beneš from match to match grows into a boxing ace. Radovan Bisić comes to the club and Petar Krstić becomes a coach. The champion team is formed: Zdravko and Zvonko Pala, Zembo, Homa, Šindolić, Beneš, Dervoz, Košpić, Jokić, Bisić, Bašić, Ožegović and Ninković.
In the year of “Slavia“ becomes the champion of Yugoslavia. Its first team mark great results in the next almost twenty years. Marijan Beneš becomes the amateur and professional champion of Europe and vice champion of the world, Radovan Bisić wins the European bronze, Dragomir Vujković wins the world's silver, and the great competing period of “Slavia” is rounded by Anton Josipović, who grew in the Club, with the gold medal at the Olympics in 1984, when he was announced as the best boxer in the world by The New York Times. Until the nineties, “Slavia” dominated the Yugoslav boxing scene.
In the hard times of war, the Club existed, worked and was the bearer of activities over the establishment of the Boxing Federation of the Republika Srpska, formed on 25 September 1992, just after the Football Federation.
“Slavia” is the multi champion of today’s Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today “Slavia” is on the road of big return to the Balkan and European boxing scene. It has proved this with a number of activities marking its 50 golden years. And it has the right to be proud: Anton Josipović is this year's winner of the “April Award” of the City of Banja Luka, the President of the Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik awarded Dragan Batar with the Njegoš medal. Slavia showed its size with the election of Marijan Beneš for the boxer of the century, and he was elected by the greatest aces of the Club, lead by the Olympic winner Anton Josipović.
“Slavia” is one of the rare clubs in the world which found itself on a postal stamp, a Memorial “Radovan Bisić”, held on the Krajina Square was selected, by the official marks of AIBA and EABA, among the best organised manifestations in Europe and the world in the Olympic boxing.
With this short recap, before all of “Slavia’s” very beginning, followed by that came next, I did not mention many little-great competitors, because that would lead us to infinity. I did not speak about the whole army of sporting enthusiasts and fans. To all of them, “Slavia” will soon gift a representation monograph with the best Banja Luka sporting and boxing stories, which will keep the memory of “Slavia’s” competitors, committee members, and Club secretaries, simply – all “Slavia’s” men in the past five decades will be in one place.
By opening of the exhibition of the past years, and this official Academy, “Slavia” is proving its greatness and opening doors for the great future.
Thank you."

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning!
I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election and thank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for successfully presiding over the previous session of the General Assembly.
I also wish to express my deepest gratitude to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for visiting my country this July. As we are marking the twentieth anniversary of our admission to the United Nations, his visit came as recognition that Bosnia and Herzegovina has travelled a long way since joining this Organization, having transformed itself from a recipient of security assistance into a contributor to global peace and security.
I also want to commend the Secretary General for his tireless efforts to advance dialogue and cooperation, and his firm commitment to the core values and principles of the United Nations. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina recognize the importance of, and we fully support his action agenda that identified five generational imperatives: prevention, a more secure world, helping countries in transition, empowering women and youth, and sustainable development.
Mr. President,
Today’s world is a scene of unfolding crises and mounting global challenges. The first and foremost of these is the disaster in Syria.
As we stand here, our fellow Syrians are fighting against a brutal regime. They are fighting to take their destiny into their own hands. The regime of Bashar al-Assad is answering their yearning for freedom and democracy with guns and bombs, just like his father's regime did thirty years ago. This is revolting and morally reprehensible. But so is our collective failure to stop it.
Once again, we are idly standing by while a human tragedy of dramatic proportions is unfolding before our eyes. We should do our part to help the Syrian people's historic stand for freedom. We should do our part to save the people of Syria from tyranny. We should. But we are not.
The images coming from Syria remind us of the tragedy of Bosnia. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina feel the pain of the Syrian people as our own because we went through the same horrors not that long ago.
When the Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited Srebrenica with me this July to pay respects to the genocide victims, he said:
“The international community must be united not to see any further bloodshed in Syria because I do not want to see any of my successors, after 20 years, visiting Syria, apologizing for what we could have done to protect the civilians in Syria – which we are not doing now”.
His predecessor, Kofi Annan, stated in the report on the fall of Srebrenica:
“Through error, misjudgment and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica….The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever….”
Today, these words ring true about this Organization’s failure to respond to the tragedy in Syria.
The best way to honor the victims of the Srebrenica genocide would have been to learn the lessons of that failure and not to commit the same errors ever again. Sadly, the United Nations, especially its Security Council, have failed to do so.
The international community has chosen, yet again, to repeat the trial-and-error pattern of policies that failed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The resolutions, statements of concern, ineffective sanctions, observers, and no mandate to protect civilians are actions that have deadly consequences demonstrated in my country.
Make no mistake. Unless we act now and act decisively to help the people of Syria and put an end to their bloodshed, this tragedy will haunt our history forever, just like Srebrenica.
Mr. President,
The developments at the beginning of the twenty-first century defy rational prediction.
Indeed, who could have predicted such an explosion of freedom in the Middle East?
In the last few years, we have been witnessing a historic awakening in the Arab world. Underway now are profound social and political changes, aimed at creating democratic societies.
These changes have been fermenting for decades. They are the best confirmation that Muslims strongly strive for freedom, dignity, and human rights.
A well-educated, free-thinking generation of young Arabs has finally broken the chains of dictatorship. No force can prevent this new generation from taking charge of their destiny.
As a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly supported the Arab peoples’ aspirations for greater freedom and democracy. We acted to ensure that the international community supported those who wanted free societies instead of closed ones, rule of law instead of rule of one person, democracy instead of dictatorship, justice and fairness instead of oppression and corruption.
Mr. President,
The stalemate in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is deeply troubling. The peace process is not moving forward. The chain of violence has not broken.
A new impetus to negotiations is urgently needed because there is no alternative to a negotiated solution.
The Palestinians have every right – historic, moral, and legal – to a state of their own. Israel has every right to its security. The occupation must end. But so must the terror and violence.
All attempts to create new realities on the ground in the hope those will become accepted as a starting point of future negotiations must be rejected. The continuation of settlement activities on occupied Palestinian territories continues to pose the most serious obstacle to peace. Israel should immediately end all settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territories because these activities are illegal under international law. Doing so is in Israel’s own best interest if it truly desires peace with the Palestinians.
The state of affairs of sixty or six thousand years ago is not the right point of reference. The right reference point for a solution is the principle of peaceful coexistence of two sovereign states – an independent Palestine and a secure Israel. That is the only realistic way to bring about a just resolution to the conflict and ensure stability and progress in the Middle East.
To achieve such a solution, a more sincere attempt at good-faith negotiations is needed, especially by Israel. The road to peace does not go by way of ignoring the United Nations resolutions, by squeezing the Palestinians to the leftovers of the land that once belonged to their fathers, and by building settlements on those leftovers.
This Organization must send a strong message that its resolutions have to be respected – that there are no double standards or chosen peoples when it comes to the application of the international legal norms and human rights principles.
Mr. President,
In the past weeks we have witnessed disturbing violence linked to intolerance. The video that sparked these developments is deeply insulting. It deserves the strongest condemnation, and we absolutely reject its content and message.
There is, however, no justification for responding to this movie with violence. Violence in response to speech is unacceptable. There can be no debate about that. Violence is no way to honor religion. Responding to bigotry with violance only fans the flames of intolerance further.
We must draw the line at violence. But we also must find a way to prevent hate speech and bigotry. Yes, there is the right to free speech. But there is also the right to dignity.
We cannot impose our ideology or our religion on anyone else. We must promote tolerance. But we must also promote mutual respect. That is why, as responsible leaders, we should have a frank debate about the outer limits of free expression when that freedom is abused to incite hate and deliberately slander the dignity of others.
Mr. President,
There is no inherent contradiction between Islamic and Western values. To the contrary, these values are compatible. After all, they derive from the same sources. Throughout history, interactions between these values have led to tremendous achievements.
There is no clash. There are only those who need to create a false perception of clash in order to come to power or maintain their hold on power.
So many societies in today’s world are in transition, yearning to find a balance between traditional and modern values. The relation between the West and the Islamic world and between their respective value systems is going to be one of the most critical issues of our time. That relation will pass through crises and periods of misunderstanding and intolerance. In this modern age, we have to keep searching for a formula, a model for how to reconcile the relations between Islamic and Western values, between the East and West. No matter how hard it may be, finding that formula is going to be essential in the time ahead of us.
The human condition is one of diversity. Our human race is a mosaic composed of a rich variety of peoples, cultures and religions that shine together in a dynamic, sparkling pattern. Our responsibility is to nurture and protect that mosaic.
I come from a country whose historical experience can offer valuable lessons in finding a model for peaceful co-existence of such diversity. The whole world can benefit from the lessons my country has learned from constantly seeking to improve its understanding and management of diversity.
For hundreds of years, its citizens lived in harmony, helping each other to build houses of worship that almost physically lean on one another. The westernmost range of Orthodox Christianity and Islam, the easternmost range of Catholicism, Bosnia is a meeting point of civilizations, a bridge between the East and the West. Its unique multiethnic culture has been woven through one thousand years of tolerance and respect among its citizens, regardless of their ethnic and religious affiliation. That is why its preservation and success, as a specific microcosm, is crucial for the whole world.
But due to our recent past, a great struggle is now underway in my country between the idea of co-existence and the idea of division. I believe the outcome of this struggle will have a significant bearing on resolving one of the greatest challenges of our time -- that of conflict versus cooperation. If the idea of co-existence and cooperation does not prevail in Bosnia, it can hardly prevail anywhere else in this world of ours. If the unique social fabric of my country, that was torn by crimes and force, is not renewed, that will be a defeat for the very idea of co-existance. It will be a defeat that will produce a widening gap at one of the most delicate fault lines of our world.
Mr. President,
The growing power of humankind brings progress and prosperity. Yet, the selfish side of that power cuts into the very substance on which our future depends - our physical habitat and our spiritual essence.
The world we live in is changing at a speed and in a direction that is rightfully worrysome. Inequality, injustice, and intolerance are rising. There is more conflict and less cooperation. There is ever more violence and ever less compassion, solidarity, mutual care, healthy interpersonal relations and family life. People around the world take to the streets in a dramatic warning that there is ever less fairness in the societies in which they live. These unsetlling trends can be reversed only by a decisive and coordinated global action. The future we desire will not be a utopia if we join our forces in finding the right solutions. Cooperative approaches are difficult to accomplish but are needed more than ever.
We are not perfect, but we can be better. We can be wiser, more responsible, more willing to learn from our past mistakes. Too often we have been prisoner of our own mentality. We perceive willingness to compromise as a weakness. But just the opposite is true – compromise requires courage.
To build a future, we must make compromises. To succeed, we must stop indulging in manipulative kinds of populism. We must break out of the worn and frayed patterns of the past. We must turn to the future. Instead of having endless debates about what has been, we must devote ourselves to reaching agreements about what can be.
We must correctly interpret the interests of those we represent. We must listen to the views of others, no matter how different those views may be. We must understand each other better and respect each other more.
Mr. President,
Our most important mission in the time to come will be to build bridges between cultures, religions, and civilizations; bridges of trust, understanding, and respect; bridges to reach problems the true nature of which we have only begun to understand. That is hard work that requires daring leadership.
This Organization has gone through difficult trials. But it has always been the best framework for building those bridges. Let us keep it that way going forward.
Thank you very much."

Minister of Security Ahmetović,
Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia Dačić,
Distinguished ministers, ambassadors, representatives, professors,
Dear guests!
Welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is my enormous pleasure to, as a sponsor of this conference, greet you and wish you successful work.
I wish to thank the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by the Minister Ahmetović, and the American University, headed by Mr. Prcić, for the organization of this conference.
I see today’s conference as another confirmation of the firm commitment of all states in our region to the strengthening of mutual cooperation.
I hope that at this conference, you will offer answers to numerous questions which the time of powerful, fast technological progress sets before us, but also to the challenges and security risks brought by this progress.
Security is the basis of stability and prosperity of every state.
In that context, the fight against organized crime is of the utmost priority.
Although it can sometimes sound as a known phrase, I will repeat it here: the fact is that organized crime acts jointly, in coordination, not recognizing the state borders, or national divisions.
The regional cooperation in the field of security has no alternative. In order for it to be a successful story, we need a clear regional security strategy, operational communication, coordination and cooperation.
But before all it is needed for us to have mutual trust. It is best built precisely through the dialogue of security leaders such as this gathering of today is.
None of our states can successfully confront nor protect from complex and mutually linked security challenges which threaten us in the modern global surroundings we live in.
Surely, none of the states of our region individually, or the wider area of the Balkans, can act alone without strong international institutions and systems, and in that context every single cooperation is necessary and welcome.
The specific thematic framework planned for this meeting is an excellent opportunity to approach the problem of cyber security, that is, the fight against the modern plaque of highly technological, computer crime, in a thorough, serious and scientifically relevant way.
It is my particular pleasure that the organizers of today’s gathering are the Ministry of Security of BiH and the American University.
A close cooperation among the government institutions and scientific-academic institutions is necessary and will be of key importance for us to dedicate a systematic and organized attention and successfully confront the threats and challenges in the field of cyber security.
The institutions which fight and which in future will face even more threats of cyber crime, are, along with the political support and financial resources, require necessary expert, educated staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to answer to the technically extremely complex types of cyber crime.
A tight link between the government institutions, education and economy is the key to every positive story.
That is why I do not doubt that today’s gathering will be the beginning of an all-encompassing and orchestrated process of cooperation in the field of fight against cyber crime.
Once again, I wish you a successful conference and pleasant stay in Sarajevo.
Cheers!"

We remembered our citizens who were killed - with dignity, in silence, with 11.541 empty, red chairs lined up along the main city street. The entire world of progress was with us on that day – as they were with us during more than forty months of siege; between 1992 and 1995.
Your Eminencies,
Distinguished Excellencies,
Dear Organizers,
Dear Guests!
Five months ago we marked the 20th Anniversary of the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo. We remembered our citizens who were killed - with dignity, in silence, with 11.541 empty, red chairs lined up along the main city street. The entire world of progress was with us on that day – as they were with us during more than forty months of siege; between 1992 and 1995.
Therefore, it is my great pleasure that in the days before us we are going to send powerful messages about the possibility of life together of the people of different religions and cultures – from the city which experienced the faith of the biggest Concentration Camp in the 20th Century Europe, the Symbol City, the city which in its hardest moments did not give up on the fight for the universal principles of humanism. .
For hundreds of years the citizens of this City have lived in harmony, helping each other in building oratories which physically almost touch and lean on each other. It is only in Sarajevo that within a kilometre square there are a Cathedral, an Old Orthodox Church, Mosques, a Synagogue, and a Protestant Church.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a special meeting point of the worlds – the most western reach of Orthodox Christianity and Islam, and the most Eastern reach of the Catholicism. The most unique culture of this country has been woven through the thousand years of tolerance, respect and trust amongst its citizens, regardless their nation or religion.
Through its thousand year history, this country has been a sanctuary and homeland to an incredible mixture of peoples, religions and cultures. It is one of the places on the planet Earth in which relations and emotions of the entire World entangle and unravel. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the junction of civilizations. That is why it does not belong to its citizens only. Preservation and success of Bosnia and Herzegovina, being a specific microcosm, is of crucial importance to the entire World. .
Fra Petar Anđelović, a great man, a great Bosnian, an associate and friend of my father Alija Izetbegović, while receiving the Human Rights Prize in Germany fifteen years ago, said the following:
“The very name of Bosnia, or the Bosnian, is not a term of national or territorial order. It is, before all, or more than anything else, a mark for a civilization process which through the historic changes and political events has been going on for a Millennium. Bosnia has been a place of clashes for only several years, and those projected from the outside. Bosnia has always been melting point of peoples, religions and customs. And for this reason it has always been great and unusual; and being such it cannot die, for if it dies, so will the example of how people can live together and live through the threats of the forthcoming times”
There is a historic battle led in Bosnia and Herzegovina result of which will answer one of the greatest dilemmas of our times: Will the idea of life together or the one of division win?
If the idea of life together does not win in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is hard for that idea to win anywhere in this complicated World of ours. If for the thousand years woven weft torn by crimes and force is not renewed, the entire World will be defeated. It will be the defeat which will produce a widening gap in one of the most delicate binding of humanity.
The gatherings as this one is can be of crucial aid to the affirmation of a positive future scenario, for they bring together people of thought and spirit who create public opinion, and who recognize the importance of the process which is taking place here in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the whole World. The World can learn important lessons in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the lessons about good and evil, about open mindedness and narrow mindedness, about wisdom and stupidity.
The growing power of a man brings progress and wellbeing. Yet the selfish side of that power awakes the very substance on which the future of the planet Earth and human kind depend - tangible and spiritual essence. The World we live in changes before our very eyes and grows in speed and direction which is worrying. There are more and more wars, violence, pollutions and less of good, compassion, mutual care and healthy interpersonal relations and family life. It is only by decisive, global and coordinated action that this negative trend can be stopped.
We owe it to our home, the Blue Planet which is entirely unique in the whole Universe. There is nothing similar as far as the most powerful telescope can reach. Everything on it testifies about the Almighty Creator. About the One Who Creates and overcomes the nothingness with existence, the deadness with life, determination with freedom. It is us - who are imperfect - that have been entrusted with the perfect harmony. We are not, but we can be better. We can be wiser, more aware of the responsibility, more ready to learn from our earlier mistakes and not repeat them.
Dear Friends!
I wish you a pleasant stay in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I wish for us to send important and clear messages from this city to the World – the messages of tolerance, mutual pervading life, respect for others and different, and respect of human rights.
In two years, in 2014, Europe and the World will mark the 100th Anniversary of the Sarajevo Assassination, the event which was the reason for the beginning of the WWI and an introduction into the century of wars and suffering of tens of millions of peoples. It will be an opportunity for all of us to jointly say that the humanity has overcome those horrible and important lessons. It will be an opportunity for us to, from this Martyr City, and the Hero City, we announce the century of peace and prosperity of the human kind.

BiH Presidency Member from the RS Radmanović and Ambassador Yamazaki talked about the current political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the current political problems faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina on its European path.
BiH Presidency Member from the RS Radmanović informed the Ambassador about the current political happenings and problems in fulfilling the commitments of the national leaders, as agreed with the representatives of the European Union in Brussels. He pointed out to a clear fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot fulfill the commitments in the planned deadline, which is further negatively affected by the political confusion in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in relation to the composition of the ruling coalition, and the election campaign for the forthcoming local elections in BiH.
The two interlocutors expressed hope that, despite the evident political differences and the rivalry of the parties, the local elections in BiH will pass in a democratic atmosphere. BiH Presidency Member from the RS Radmanović thanked the Ambassador for his understanding of the political situation within Bosnia and Herzegovina and a great support which Japan continuously offers to BiH."

Our constitutional and political system is based on a peace agreement. That peace agreement is as it is and could not have been different because its goal was to satisfy the needs of the conflicting parties so that they have the mechanisms of protection against dominance. And such mechanisms are, in their nature, the mechanisms of stopping, and not the mechanisms of initiating.
Dear Commissioner Füle,
Commissioner Potočnik,
Chairman Bevanda,
Party presidents,
Ladies and gentlemen!
I wish to thank Commissioner Füle for the organization of this gathering today, which is the first of its kind.
These meetings should become a regular practice, because we need a more intensive political dialogue with the highest officials of the European Union.
I see today’s meeting as one more confirmation that the doors of the European Union are open for us. However, it is our responsibility to use this opportunity betters, so that we speed up the process of the accession of our country to the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complex country with a difficult burden of the newer history. Our constitutional and political system is based on a peace agreement. That peace agreement is as it is and could not have been different because its goal was to satisfy the needs of the conflicting parties so that they have the mechanisms of protection against dominance. And such mechanisms are, in their nature, the mechanisms of stopping, and not the mechanisms of initiating.
Bosna i Hercegovina je kompleksna država sa teškim bremenom novije historije. Naš ustavni i politički sistem je baziran na mirovnom sporazumu. Taj sporazum je takav kakav jeste i nije mogao biti drugačiji zato jer mu je cilj bio da zadovolji potrebe suprotstavljenih strana da imaju mehanizme zaštite od dominacije. A takvi mehanizmi su, po svojoj prirodi, mehanizmi zaustavljanja, a ne mehanizmi pokretanja.
There are opposing emotions and differing views on the past and the future in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because of that, it is hard to reach compromises, and particularly via consensus on important questions.
Still, building of European future and integration into the EU is a clearly expressed wish, intention and interest of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And there are several reasons for this.
Firstly, the European path is the only realistic platform on which a long term stability and prosperity of our country can be assured.
Secondly, we are aware of the advantages which the EU accession brings. It is in our absolute interest to be a part of the association of organized states among and within which there is peace, understanding, the rule of Law, equal standards, high level of human rights protection and culture of dialogue.
And thirdly, the process of association itself, that is, the adjustment to the legal heritage of the EU and the standards which are there in the various fields of social activities is important to us. That process represents a tool for reforms which we will utilise to create an organised society and functional state which guarantees prosperity.
Despite the awareness and readiness, expressed wish and recognised interest, Bosnia and Herzegovina seriously and every day increasingly lags behind the rest of the states of the region in the process of European integrations.
Therefore, the question we need to answer is: How do we make and maintain long term progress on that European path?
Before all, we have to look towards and dedicate ourselves to the future. We must stop with wrangling on what happened before and finally devote ourselves to reaching agreement on what can and needs to be achieved.
The European future of Bosnia and Herzegovina can only be built on the basis of compromise which recognise interests and rights of all: the state, both entities, all three of the constitutive peoples and all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That is why the future reforms should not be directed towards the centralisation, nor should they be directed towards decentralisation, but towards integration, coordination and synchronisation.
We need to avoid situations in which any part of our country should feel jeopardised or neglected. The state, entities and cantons, as well as the Brčko District must have their property over the process of BiH integrations to the EU, for in any different way we would be facing blockades and procrastinations.
European Officials expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to communicate with the EU with one voice, the precondition for which is that all communication from our side be agreed in advance and within the framework of the existing institutions, at all levels of government.
A complex structure of our state has been a serious challenge in the process of agreement reaching and negotiations with the EU representatives.
The main problem is the absence of possibility of solving political disputes within the institutions, as well as the absence of obligation for the tasks taken to be executed.
Therefore, it is of the greatest importance for us today to recognise the need and to reach fundamental consensus in establishing a single functioning and efficient mechanism of coordination of the European actions in BiH.
This mechanism of coordination must not be cumbersome. It must be “institutionally and politically correct”, that is, it must respect the Dayton Constitution organisation and the existing organisation of the state apparatus and in that way to represent an efficient upgrade of that apparatus.
It is necessary for this mechanism to formalise political coordination, which will have an obligation to solve open questions and disputes, and to give compulsory directives to experts and persons in charge at all levels of government. Besides that, we must strengthen the capacity of the state services in order for them to be able to carry out these tasks.
The today’s meeting is taking place at the time of another political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in the Federation. It is due to that fact, of which we all here are very aware, I am inviting you to make sure that this gathering of ours passes in the atmosphere of tolerant talks focused on what we are all here for and on which we all agree. And that is the acceleration of the process of the EU accession. At this moment, all our mutual misunderstandings should be put aside for the sake of the higher cause.
I expect us all to clearly express readiness to, in the spirit of compromise, take necessary steps in order to fulfill all the conditions for membership application submission which would be considered credible by the EU. The most important of those is the implementation of the Sejdić – Finci Ruling. It would be an extremely good message to send if at today’s meeting we agreed to fulfill these conditions within the precisely set deadlines.
I am certain that we will have enough wisdom and the European way of thinking in order to cope with the challenges before us. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a European state, the Europeans live in Bosnia and Herzegovina and it is time for that ship to be anchored in her home harbor.
That historical task is of this generation of politicians and I firmly believe that we all are aware of it.
Thank you!"
41604,Address by BiH Presidency Member from Republika Srpska Nebojša Radmanović at the Summit of Head of States of the South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41604&langTag=en-US,2012-06-15,"This SEECP Summit is being held at the time of the global financial and economic crisis which in particular has shaken the Euro-zone and the countries of our region. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been, from the beginning, consistently dedicated to the regional cooperation as a way and the path which substitutes the times of conflicts and tense relations between the countries of the South-East Europe, which we confirmed during our presiding of this initiative some years ago.
Distinguished Mister Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the beginning I wish before all to thank the organisers of this important gathering, primarily to our host, President of the Republic of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić for the excellent and successful organisation of the Summit of Head of States of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process. Also, Mister President, I once again wish to congratulate you on having been elected the President of the Republic of Serbia and I wish you plenty of success in performing this great duty entrusted to you by the Serb people and other citizens of Serbia.
This SEECP Summit is being held at the time of the global financial and economic crisis which in particular has shaken the Euro-zone and the countries of our region. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been, from the beginning, consistently dedicated to the regional cooperation as a way and the path which substitutes the times of conflicts and tense relations between the countries of the South-East Europe, which we confirmed during our presiding of this initiative some years ago. Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks to develop regional cooperation in accordance with the overall European determination and its own economic and political interests.
The SEECP is a forum for political dialogue on the questions of cooperation among the states of the region and as such it has potentials. The existence and such work of the states in the South-East Europe does not limit other forms, models and channels for regional cooperation to also exist in the region.
The concrete activities on creating bonds among our countries in the fields of economy, trade, transport and communication represent regional property within mutual relations. The Council Regional Cooperation is a framework wide enough within which the regional cooperation can be exercised respecting basic rules. We are against further institutionalisation of the SEECP and other regional initiatives for it only leads towards further unnecessary bureaucratisation of this process and covering of the concrete core of the relations among the states. All other open issues among the states we should solve through bilateral relations, dialogue or negotiations, using existing institutional mechanisms of the UN, EU and OSCE on the basis of the International Law.
This year, the Council of Ministers was formed in BiH, fifteen months after the elections, which was followed by the launch of the started reforms. As a result the Laws on State Aid and Census, which for long were in the Parliamentary procedures, were passed. The structural dialogue on the Judiciary with the EU assistance is continued. The final consultations among the parliamentary parties with regards to the final formulation for the implementation of the Decision of the European Court in Strasbourg are ongoing with an aim of adjusting BiH Constitution to the European Convention on Human Rights. We now only need to begin talks on building coordination mechanism needed for BiH accession to the EU. If this job is successfully done by the end of the year, BiH plans to submit the EU membership candidate application. With this aim, we expect that the high level dialogue to be held on the process of BiH accession to the EU, which is to take place by the end of this month in Brussels, to offer certain solutions and guidance in this process.
BiH is devoted to the EU integrations, regardless the occasional halts and slowness in solving certain conditions set on that path. The EU is our goal so that any calculations with regards to further enlargement, prior deadlines setting for certain countries or the group of countries, which we hear of from certain European circles, can be counterproductive and damaging to the entire region. We oppose the suspension of further enlargement of the EU after Croatia joins in 2013, which certain political powers in Europe speak for such political divides the region and the rest of the countries in Europe, in those which can and those which cannot be the EU members. That is a bad message to the entire region but the Europe too. It will increase the euro-scepticism and which I, due to the euro zone crisis, strongly present in the region. It will too encourage further divisions and fragmentations in the region. The sooner we get the candidate status, the more motivated we will be to join the EU and work on the realisation of pre-accession obligations and vice versa.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In BiH, we appreciate the understanding shown for our internal situation, the complicated constitutional-legal organisation and political specificity. We thank all of you who good willingly wish to help us, but here I have to say that, for further development and progress no outer mediators are needed. We can and must solve our internal problems alone, because it is in our best interest. We need support in what we agree in order to implement it. We need the input of positive experiences of other countries in similar situations, and not the recipes from the past, ultimatums and pressures. Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the Dayton Agreement, and with the assistance of the EU Special Representative in BiH, has all realistic and needed conditions for fulfilling necessary reform obligations and changes towards the EU membership.
When BiH stance towards regional questions is of the matter I will repeat our well known and unchangeable position. Bosnia and Herzegovina stands for the question of Kosovo and Metohia to be solved through negotiations on the basis of a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, within the frame of the UN Resolution 1244 and negotiating arrangements with the EU.
Finally, I wish to once again thank the host for the well-organized gathering, constructive approach of the participants and wish plenty of success to all in future work of the regional initiative. I wish plenty of success to the host of our next SEECP in organising and preparing it.
Thank you"
41588,Address of BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović at the Ceremony of unveiling of the monument to the men from Bosnia and Herzegovina who fought and died on the Isonzo Front in the First World War,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41588&langTag=en-US,2012-06-08,"These beautiful landscapes, miraculous beauty and well preserved natural harmony in no way today reveal that only a century ago here the history of Europe and the mankind was being written in blood. In these inhospitable mountain cliffs and canyons, most often in capricious storms, icy rains, snows and blizzards, thousands of soldiers were dying on the Isonzo Front, in the one of the strategically most important areas in the Great War, as WWI was called then.
Dear President Türk,
Distinguished hosts, dear friends!
These beautiful landscapes, miraculous beauty and well preserved natural harmony in no way today reveal that only a century ago here the history of Europe and the mankind was being written in blood.
In these inhospitable mountain cliffs and canyons, most often in capricious storms, icy rains, snows and blizzards, thousands of soldiers were dying on the Isonzo Front, in the one of the strategically most important areas in the Great War, as WWI was called then.
A significant number of Bosniaks fought within the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Isonzo Front. It is important to remind that all of the members of the Tzar’s Regiments from Bosnia and Herzegovina were called Bosniaks regardless they religion.
Bosnia and Herzegovina largely affected the destiny of Austria. The 40 year long Epoch, 1878 to 1918, characterised by the intensive historical events, marked a significant rise and the later disappearance of the Empire as the European and World power.
In all those events, Bosnia and Herzegovina was an unavoidable factor on which the lasting historical marks were left.
Historical facts are those that the Bosniaks had given an unexpectedly powerful resistance to the Austro-Hungarian occupation. It is truth that the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was the State of Law in which religious and national rights were protected, which was fair towards the Bosniaks, and to which the Bosniaks returned by being fair and devoted –they were loyal, brave, professional and devoted members of the Tzar’s Regiments.
World War I began after Gavrilo Princip unfortunately assassinated Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the war in which the Bosniaks devotedly fought within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Austria used the military potentials of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the maximum. According to data from those times, in the period of WWI, the troops of Bosnia and Herzegovina, within the Austro-Hungarian Military counted over 250 000 men.
There are numerous testimonies of the courage and fighting skill of the Bosnian soldiers. Hundreds of Bosniaks were awarded highest Austro-Hungarian medals.
Yet the biggest hardships and sacrifices of the War were taken by the Bosniaks, to which the Isonzo Front testifies and this cemetery on which we remember them today with the greatest respect.
The Bosnian 4 Regiment (BH Regiment 4) was one of the assault divisions which by chest to chest fighting broke through the Italian lines during the last Isonzo Battle, and brought the turn and the final victory to the Austrian side. During WWI almost 5000 Bosniaks lost their lives in the area of Slovenia, out of which 859 found their eternal rest at this cemetery.
I particularly wish to thank our distinguished Mufti Nedžad Grabus today who, along with the indispensible and important support of Slovenia, did everything for the cemetery in Log under the Mangart to be the place which will continue to preserve the memory of men to whom the history determined faith to leave their bones away from their homes and families, and away from their homeland. By placing the nišan tombstones the multi-decade long post-mortem injustice caused to Bosniak-Muslims on whose graves the religious symbols of others were placed during the SHS Kingdom era has ended.
This Ceremony too is an opportunity for us to testify that at places like this the history lessons are best learned and for us to send the messages of peace, to our region before all which still has not buried all of its dead from the wars of the 1990s, but to Europe too with the hope and belief that the 21st Century we shall spend without wars and bloodsheds.
Dear friends,
My country and my people have their own millennium and historical path. The Bosniaks fought for Sultans and Tzars, they loyally wore the Partisans’ five-point star, and with great passion tried to save Yugoslavia.
The wheel of history most of the times was against them, threatened to run them over and wipe them off the face of the Earth.
On such, most of the time tragic, experience the Bosnia and Herzegovina of today was made. In the last war Bosniaks fought for their country only. In future they are ready to be a part of state and military alliances which will guard and enhance global peace and prosperity.
The reformed Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina of today, made of three national components, take part in NATO missions contributing the construction of the architecture of world peace and stability.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, being yesterday’s receiver of aid, has become an active contributor in resolving the world crises. We shall continue walking that path.
The Euro-Atlantic integrations have no alternative for us, for it is only like that shall our future generations be in a position to live in peace and prosperity.
I hope that young Bosnians, yet all others too, will not leave their homes in future to fight wars, but to spend their energy on saving this planet of ours and making it a good place to live in mutual respect.
May the schools and universities be our most important frontlines.
In order to realize that we must never forget those to whom history determined a different faith, as it was with our ancestors, the brave and proud Bosnian warriors of the Isonzo and the Alps.
I pray to God to give their souls His compassion, forgiveness and eternal peace!
Thank you.

41574,"ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDENCY OF BiH BAKIR IZETBEGOVIĆ AT THE 10th UNESCO SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATES OF SOUTH EAST EUROPE, MOSTAR 02",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41574&langTag=en-US,2012-06-03,"Bosnia and Herzegovina is a good meeting place, because each one of us can find a piece of his/her identity and tradition here. As you will see just a step away from this place, in Međugorje, Catholics from the whole of the world gather, and in its vicinity is the Blagaj Tekke (House) where Muslims, as if doing a pilgrimage, come, and the Žitomislići Orthodox temple is nearby.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a good meeting place, because each one of us can find a piece of his/her identity and tradition here. As you will see just a step away from this place, in Međugorje, Catholics from the whole of the world gather, and in its vicinity is the Blagaj Tekke (House) where Muslims, as if doing a pilgrimage, come, and the Žitomislići Orthodox temple is nearby.
Here live by origin and roots connected followers of Faith in One God, similar in all but the way they address Him.
The apparent Bosnian-Herzegovinian complexity was known to be the source of numerous prejudices and trivial simplifications, for which this country paid a high price. However, multi-religiousness, cultural and civilization complexity throughout her long history were more often the advantages and the wealth which she was recognised by, and much more rarely a handicap which brought her into question. Such Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite contrasts, or rather, thanks to them, has been carrying within herself a specific spirituality the significance of which transgresses her size, strength and wealth. The possibility of her existence witnesses the possibility of the survival of diversity, and with it, the world at large.
Parallel to Catholicism and Orthodoxy, surviving in the Middle Ages, with its peak in the 14th and 15th Centuries, was a strong heretical Bosnian Church, which we call Bogomil, so that trichotomy, lastly with Islam also, appears in her history as a kind of a dare. The worldly flair was given to this country by Judaism, which following the extradition from Spain, gained sanctuary in Bosnia, the then part of the Ottoman Empire.
One of the most distinctive characteristics of Herzegovina is the Old Bridge, the pearl of cultural heritage, where we have gathered today, next to its arch.
It is not coincidental that both Bosnian-Herzegovinian properties registered on the list of the world’s cultural heritage under UNESCO protection are precisely bridges: the Višegrad bridge, of Mehmed-pasha Sokolović, and this magnificent one, of Mostar. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a special relation towards the bridges; constructors devote particular attention to their harmony because bridges connect river banks, people and nations.
And this country is a sort of a bridge, or at least, it wished to be so in her centuries-old existence; the bridge of understanding amongst the worlds, amongst various possibilities, the bridge between the East and the West.
On a tentative list for UNESCO patronage are our tombstones – stećak, unique medieval stone graves dedicated to death, but with its ornamentation glorify life.
A list of our candidates consists of, equally precious, Sarajevo as the unique symbol of universal multi-cultural society, natural and architectural ensemble of Jajce, historically-urban areas of Počitelj and Blagaj, natural and historical areas of Blidinje and Stolac, and the natural monument, the cave Vjetrenica with the architectural unity with the village of Zavala.
Let our joint candidacy for stećak as a cultural heritage be a good motive and example for better understanding and synergy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, and a good spirit of those stones joins us in our endeavour to accomplish the goal and enlist into the world’s cultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO, 22 Bosnian-Herzegovinian necropolis, three from each Serbia and Montenegro, and two from Croatia. It will be an example of cooperation between neighbours linked more by their joint past than divided by it.
This is an opportunity to thank UNESCO on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina for numerous projects which it has supported in post war Bosnia and Herzegovina, in reconstruction of schools, religious and cultural buildings and giving expert assistance in various fields, but also in reconstruction of the Old Bridge here in Mostar.
Let us, whose destiny is to share this joint space of South East Europe, know very well that the good is not merely given, but that it needs to be fought for, make on this occasion also an honourable effort to be clearly heard and be better understood. With that wish and message, once more I greet you and wish you a warm welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina, to this city of light, in the reconstructed building of the Town Hall, close to the reconstructed Old Bridge.
Let that spirit of optimism, tolerance and reconstruction be the silver lining of this and our every meeting ahead.
Thank you for your attention"

We have come here to reaffirm our commitment to NATO and further strengthen our valuable partnership with the Alliance.
Secretary General Rasmussen,
President Obama,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great honor and pleasure to take part in NATO’s 25th Summit.
I would like to express our appreciation to the United States for hosting the Summit and warmly welcoming us to the beautiful city of Chicago.
We have come here to reaffirm our commitment to NATO and further strengthen our valuable partnership with the Alliance.
As a country that has significantly benefited from international assistance, Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly understands the value of NATO’s efforts in Afghanistan.
For several years now, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been contributing to NATO’s activities in Afghanistan because we firmly believe we have a responsibility to play an active part in NATO’s missions.
The fourth rotation of our infantry company is currently deployed in ISAF under the Danish contingent.
Resulting from the progress made in our defense reform, we have decided to expand our participation in ISAF by deploying our military police officers with the United States National Guard of the State of Maryland.
As part of an Adriatic Charter regional initiative, we are also increasing the number of our military police instructors in the NATO Training Mission.
These military police officers and instructors will be providing niche capabilities that are currently in high demand in Afghanistan.
We are also contributing in other ways.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has donated significant quantities of weapons to the Afghan National Army, with the view that key to success of the transition are well-trained and well-equipped Afghan National Security Forces.
And we are considering contributing to the training of Afghan women-officers. We believe that by doing so – in the context of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 – we would send a message to the people of Afghanistan about the values shared by the NATO Member States and the aspirants for NATO membership.
Having transformed from being a recipient of security assistance to being a contributor to global security, Bosnia and Herzegovina is aware that the sustained commitment of contributing nations is critical for securing a lasting stability in Afghanistan.
We are thus firmly committed to continue our engagement in Afghanistan until, and after, 2014 – to the extent allowed by our resources and capabilities.
Bosnia and Herzegovina support the transition in Afghanistan because this process will create preconditions for ""local ownership"", which is indispensable for securing sustainable peace in Afghanistan.
We welcome the recent signing of the U.S. – Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, as a critical step towards ensuring ownership by the Afghan authorities.
We also welcome the Danish 3C initiative as a good mechanism for long-term assistance to Afghanistan, and we are currently considering specific opportunities for our involvement.
We strongly support the process of reconciliation and reintegration in Afghanistan. Based on our own experience, we know this is a painstaking task that can be accomplished only by mutual respect and understanding.
We encourage all parties in Afghanistan to engage in this process and to make compromises to achieve what all citizens of Afghanistan desire – security, stability and prosperity for themselves and for their children.
Having understood the value of regional cooperation, we also urge Afghanistan’s neighbors to play a constructive role, and we welcome the results achieved in this respect through the Istanbul process.
In closing, I would like take this opportunity to thank you for the contributions that your governments and NATO have made to peace, security and stability in my country. We remain determined to protect that investment by ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes a NATO member.
Thank you.

In particular, I wish to greet Mister Ban Ki Moon, the UN Secretary General and thank him for the invitation to participate in today's Thematic Debate which surely deserves attendance and attention of leaders; before all, the leaders of states and the global business leaders.
Mister President,
Mister Secretary General,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to, on behalf of BiH Presidency, greet and address you at this distinguished meeting. In particular, I wish to greet Mister Ban Ki Moon, the UN Secretary General and thank him for the invitation to participate in today's Thematic Debate which surely deserves attendance and attention of leaders; before all, the leaders of states and the global business leaders.
The world economy and its condition impose on us to, by the means of debates of this kind, deliver various views of the present state of economy and possible ways of overcoming and resolving the key economic problems.
Before all, I wish to say a few words on the state of the BiH economy, especially in the light of the political-economic relations in the region of the Balkans and the EU.
The economy of BiH is open and fully liberal, with foreign trade and economic links directed towards the states of the region and the EU. The geographic position, historical links, similarity of the market and the connections of the companies affect the dominant connections of BiH economy with the economies of the states of the region. The entire region of South-East Europe, regardless whether the states are the EU members or the ones waiting for the membership, is constituted of developing states. All of the countries of the region, thus BiH as one of them, had made the economic growth rate of 5% until 2008 and had made progress in the key economic indicators, such as the growth in industrial production, reduction in unemployment rate, the growth of GDP, and so on.
However, due to the world economic crisis, since 2008, the economy o BiH is in recession, regardless the last year's growth of 0.8%. The key problem is the growing unemployment, which exceeds 25%, a large foreign trade exchange deficit, the small amount of economic activity and successful companies, low level of direct foreign investment, and lastly the growth of the debt and deficits in the public sector. The weak competitiveness remains to be the Achilles heel of the BiH economy and the states of the region.
Unfortunately, BiH belongs to a group of the poorest countries of the region of the Western Balkans and Europe. That is a serious challenge to the efforts in overcoming the economic crisis. The long-lasting and huge unemployment and poverty are silent destroyers of our economies and social stability. In the region of the post-conflict transition, that is a constant threat to the political stability of the country and the entire region.
I feel free to say that the same or at least similar situation characterises the economies of the countries in the region. The only advantage, if I can say so, which BiH possesses at this moment, as well as the other countries of the region, is a very low level of the public and private sector debt compared to the participation of the debt in GDP.
BiH, like other countries of the region, has not been nor should it in future face the danger of living the scenario of indebtness or inability to pay off its debt, the situation which is present in some European countries which are members of the EU.
It is certain that in the projections of the leading world financial institutions, there are not any predictions foreseeing rapid fall or crash of the economies in the region of the SE Europe. Although the situation in the economies of these countries is rather difficult with a very weak real sector of economy, a possibility for economical stabilisation exists with a relatively small support.
Here, beforall, I refer to the support of the EU and its member states; both economical and political support in the same amount. From the economic side, we need a larger level of direct investments and larger availability of loan and grant assets through different funds in the area of the real sector in which BiH and the countries of the region possess comparative advantage. This refers to investing into energetic and hydro energetic potentials, as well as, investing into steel, wood and food industry.
Besides direct support to the sector of economy, it is necessary to equally enhance the political presence and engagement of the EU in BiH and the countries of the region in order to end the process of integration into the EU. The decreased level of the EU interest to expand to the countries in the region that together with BiH are not members of the EU, besides endangering the economic flows, can also have a great influence to the development of certain euro-skepticism which could in its later phase lead to political instability.
Considering the principle of economic solidarity on which the EU is based, I hope that the developed countries of the EU, and primarily the biggest and strongest ones, will find a model to help and invest in BiH and the states of the region, in order to secure economic and political stability of an important region in Europe, as is ours.
Apart from this, the multipolarity of the economic world represents additional advantage which we wish to use through the invitation for the economic presence of the BRIKS states and the USA.
A higher level of economic cooperation and connection, along with the investments in new modern technologies in the real sector of economy represent catalysts for economic recovery and stabilisation. We must reconstruct our economy in a way that we again build our own production capacities in the real economy, return to the production of goods and depend less on the financial sector. This is the only way through which we shall we be able to cope with the increasing demands of the social state.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I believe that the development of the Internet, the emergence of new forms of energy, linkage and widening of the market and changes in global management will bring a new, more just and balanced model of the world economy in relation to the one that preceded and greatly contributed to the global economic crisis. The highlighted global awareness of dissenters in all parts of the world speaks for itself: Nobody can save oneself alone. Either we all save ourselves, or nobody gets saved!
I hope that my participation in this debate succeeded in affecting the importance of the topic of the world economy, and thus enhance our interests in mutual co-operation, dialogue and agreement on the concrete strategic steps and activities in this field.
Thank you."

Excellencies,
Honorable Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Es-sellam allejkum and good morning!
It is a distinct pleasure to welcome you to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to this year's Sarajevo Business Forum. The Third one!!
We are so happy to see you all, and proud to host such a unique event that connects investors, businesses, and governments from all over of the world.
Sarajevo Business Forum is here to offer a chance for all of us to profit in one way or another, meaning either by signing a good business deals, gaining brand recognition, creating jobs, or ensuring economic growth.
The Forum also aims to strengthen culture of the dialog among all stakeholders who benefit from organized and well functioning states, regional cooperation, and wider integration processes. All of us, at different posts, should work together in order to gain more for our citizens, internal and external customers or shareholders.
Bosna Bank International management and the employees again did a great job in organizing such a demanding event, and I thank them for that with all my heart. They are the ones without whom this gathering would be impossible to succeed.
Here with us is a man without whom Sarajevo Business Forum would never happen and become an annual event of the high regional importance. It is the Sarajevo Business Forum founder, my friend, and our former President, Dr. Haris Silajdžić.
Thank you President Silajdžić for honoring us again with your presence!
My dear friends and dear guests,
Bosnia and Herzegovina have great potentials to develop different industries very easily. It could serve as a perfect meeting point for the business people coming from the east and west. We understand them well since we share values and believes of both. Here, everybody is welcomed and appreciated.
Bosnia is also a center part of the wider Southeast European region, and friends from neighboring countries again came to this event to show how we can cooperate better.
Even though our recent past separated us, the business people and investors always perform as an engine of integrations! This region has many investment opportunities to offer. I firmly believe recognizing it will not pose a problem for you.
In any case, disintegration processes ended in the 1990s and now our region reconnects its ties and streams for new integrations. Bosnia, and I assume the same for the whole region, will further integrate into EU and NATO. Geographically, historically, politically, and culturally speaking - these Associations are the ones we should belong to. We will make it happen in the next few years.
That is why it is a right time for investors to come here. Efforts made now could pay off much more. It is better rewarding if you act as a groundbreakers and leaders, rather than as a followers and “safe players”.
We so far completed wide ranging political and socio-economic reforms. By doing that we improved business environment in our country in a great manner. Just since last year we succeed in passing the Laws which will enable us to better manage economic planning and come closer to filing credible Application for EU membership. These are Census and State Aid Laws.
We had some challenges in forming the Government in past year, but now we succeed it forming the ruling coalition. And, we did it on our own, without interference of international community. It is for the first time our complete “domestic product”, and I firmly believe it will prove to be the best one so far.
But even with last year difficulties our economy grew 1,6 percent. We expect our economy to grow at the same rate this year. These figures prove that Bosnia and Herzegovina economy is resilient and competitive.
This year, Turkish government provided us with the significant loan under specially good conditions. This loan is to help us increase agricultural production level in the regions where our returnees live.
I thank Turkish government, Turkish people and Ziraat Bank for this support very much. It is of the greatest importance for us since we do not use more than 50 percent of our agricultural land – high quality, unpolluted and fertile agricultural land.
I invite all potential investors from agriculture industry to take a deeper look into our unexplored potentials with this respect.
Let me also remind all of you that Bosnia is very rich with water, and that this huge potential is only modestly in use. This fact represents an opportunity to make investments related to bottled water or electric energy production.
Besides that Bosnia is very rich with coal, forests, strong winds, and numerous kinds of minerals. Also, and for sure, we here have oil! Shell Company representatives are exploring Bosnian oil fields as we speak. And soon we expect them to announce what our researches have already shown –Bosnia has significant quantities of oil!
We now need to focus on building infrastructure. In the last few years we made a breakthrough.
Insallah, by 2014 we will complete building of around 140 km of Corridor VC. That highway, when completed, will represent main physical and psychological reconnecting artifact of our country.
Bosnia also offers many other distinct benefits, such as: long industrial traditions, well educated and disciplined workforce, excellent geographic location, stabile currency pegged to the Euro, the rights of foreign investors equal to domestic ones, companies with long and rich tradition of engagement in international trade and business, etc.
We also signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement with the neighbouring countries, and have preferential export regimes with European Union, Canada, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and the United States.
So, if you really explore, and if you are courages and creative enough - our country is a land of many opportunities for you.
The City where this Forum takes places is a city of many opportunities for you as well. Sarajevo is one of the main historical, cultural, media, education, and industrial hubs of the region, and it welcomes you with open hands.
With that in mind, I wish you all success, and I invite you to enjoy your time here.
Thank you very much!"
41507,BiH Presidency Member from Republika Srpska Nebojša Radmanović's address at the central ceremony marking the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srp,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41507&langTag=en-US,2012-05-11,"We have reason today to feel proud, to feel solemn and triumphant. This year we are marking the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) in the year in which we are celebrating with pride the 20th Anniversary of Republika Srpska, as an important part of the political heritage of the combat of the Serb people in their long history for political and national identity.
Dear families of fallen and missing combatants of Republika Srpska,
Presidents,
Representatives,
Ministers,
Sir Generals, officers, NCOs, privates and civil persons serving in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We are here today to mark the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), whose heritage is the path of combat, the tradition of the Army of Republika Srpska and the liberation tradition of the Serb people.
We have reason today to feel proud, to feel solemn and triumphant. This year we are marking the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) in the year in which we are celebrating with pride the 20th Anniversary of Republika Srpska, as an important part of the political heritage of the combat of the Serb people in their long history for political and national identity.
This most important national date is accompanied by two other important anniversaries; the 20th Anniversary of the Army of Republika Srpska and the 7th Anniversary of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska).
Sir privates, NCOs, officers, Generals and civil persons of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), I congratulate you on the Day of the Army of Republika Srpska and the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) with our traditional military salute: Pomoz’ Bog junaci! (God Bless Heroes. op.tr.)
The Army of Republika Srpska was formed on 12 May 1992, with the aim of defending and protecting the Serb people in this region where we have lived for centuries, under the circumstances of the open and organized political and armed destruction of Yugoslavia, as a united country in which the Serb people lived together with other peoples. We were the people’s Army and the organized military formation of the Serb people in the last war in BiH.
That is why today, here together with us, beside the members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), there are the ex combatants of the Army of Republika Srpska, war veterans, members of the families of fallen combatants, members of the associations and organizations cherishing the tradition of the liberating past of the Serb people and the Serb Army.
All our thoughts and memories today are with those who bravely and boldly gave their lives for the freedom and survival of the Serb people. We pay honour to all of them, and due piety and lasting remembrance. This generation of those living in peace owes much to the generation of those who gave their lives in war. It is our moral and national obligation to turn the ideals of the combatants of the Army of Republika Srpska into a lasting order of the democratic politics of the Serb people in Republika Srpska.
The 3rd Infantry Regiment Republika Srpska follows with pride the tradition of the glorious liberating battles of the Serb people overall in the past. Let us remember the last two centuries since the First and Second Rising, the Balkan Wars, WWI and WWII, to the last war in which the Army of Republika Srpska was formed. There is an unbreakable link between Republika Srpska and the Army of Republika Srpska in which the historical and national destiny of the Serb people is reflected. The centuries long exposure to foreign conquest, enslavement and suffering of many kinds, oppression and genocide, has developed into an instinctive feeling of danger and readiness to fight for the protection of our own national being in the face of threats to existence and survival. The Army of Republika Srpska, in the past war, defended the territory of Republika Srpska and saved the Serb people. The many lives of the fallen combatants and civilians, the heroic self-sacrifice and knightly struggles of individuals, the collective suffering of the entire Serb people were made in the defence of Republika Srpska during the past war. The high price paid for freedom and the defence of the national identity in war, is one of the reasons for the defence of Republika Srpska today in peacetime.
That is the reason why all the Serbs in Republika Srpska, and almost all outside it, stand in defence of Republika Srpska and are against political demands for its abolishment, regardless of the political party they belong to or where they live.
Along with our ceremony today, two days ago we marked the 9th May, the Day of the Victory over Fascism, which, due to its importance, also became the Day of Europe. That is the day on which the entire world of progress, democracy and anti-fascism, jointly marks the 67th Anniversary of the ending of WWII and the victory over Fascism and Nazism. The Serb people made an enormous contribution to the anti-fascist fight and the victory of the Allied Coalition in WWII, upon which the democratic united Europe has been built. That is why it is hard for us today when others, who then had taken the side which lost, are taking all the credit for the fight and participation in the People-Liberating Partisan Movement in the region of the ex-Yugoslavia, the Movement which consisted mainly of Serbs, together with other Yugoslav peoples. Many in BiH today, who wholeheartedly speak about anti-fascism, remain silent about the Serb contribution to the victory of Yugoslav peoples over Fascism and Nazism, and say nothing about the mass collaboration with the occupiers and their own national Corps. The historical facts are irrefutable, and everything else is an attempt at the revision of the events from this period of our past and falsification of truth for the purpose of short term politics. To those we are sending a message today from this very place that we shall not allow a monopolization and misuse of the anti-fascist fight from WWII for propaganda and political purposes in certain media and quasi academic organizations and associations. It is those political manipulators who attribute the anti-fascism to themselves and challenge it in regard to everybody else. It is those who do not let the families of the fallen Serbs lay wreaths and flowers in the Dobrovoljacka street and other places of Serb suffering in the Federation BiH, and use that right in Republika Srpska without any disturbance.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska), as one of the three constituent parts of the joint Armed Forces of BiH, is the result of joint efforts in the reform of the defence system in Republika Srpska and BiH, with the aim of creating a modern armed forces, applicable to the peacetime needs of the country and potential threats in the future. The Republika Srpska and BiH in this process opted for the building of peace and stability as the most important factor of the wider security environment which brought Europe fifty years of development in peace and economic and social welfare. With that vision in mind, the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) has been contributing to our determination for the implementation of the necessary reforms and modernization of the defence and security sector, in the spirit of mitigating direct military threats to peace and security in the region and in this part of Europe. The institutions of Republika Srpska gave in the past a significant and constructive contribution to the necessary changes to the defence and security sector in BiH. Republika Srpska will, as it has done to date, request balanced access, equal treatment, gradualism in application of agreed arrangements, respect for the interests of all participants and strict respect for the Constitution of BiH.
The 3rd Infantry Regiment (Republika Srpska) has all the conditions to be a respectable defence component of the joint Armed Forces and a guarantee for the survival of the Serb and other peoples in BiH, but also of peace and stability in the region and in a united Europe.
If all of us in BiH in this process are most sincere and politically responsible, there is no reason why this should not remain so in future.
Thank you."
41496,"Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović at the opening of the 9th Meeting of the European Council of Religious Leaders in Sarajevo, 8 May 2012",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41496&langTag=en-US,2012-05-08,"The representatives of historically founded religions on the European soil certainly can help much in overcoming the number of challenges that our continent is facing when the question is of the fight for the environment in which we all will feel well and safe. Every message that comes from such eminent people of faith is of great importance. The messages of peace and tolerance are, certainly, the most important ones.
Dear Eminencies and Excellencies,
Salaam, Shalom and God Bless!
It is my honour and pleasure to be here with you, to speak on the subject of the tremendous importance. A unique Blue planet, resembling nothing in the universe we can see, is an obvious sign of the Divine creation. Infinitely precise connection of everything on it and everything related to it, clearly speaks that the Earth is God’s gift, that is was created with an aim to be a pleasant home, a cradle for humanity. For us, and for those coming after us. We come out its essence, use it while we live and return to it.
It was created by the One who is perfect, and given to us, obviously the imperfect ones, to manage. The growing power of a man brings progress and well-being, yet the selfish side of that power can infringes the substance we depend on – the material and spiritual substance. The world is changing and it is growing at the speed and in direction which sometimes is of concern. There are more and more wars, violence, and theft. There is less and less good, compassion, mutual concern and healthy family life.
It is only with decisive, global, coordinated action of religious and political leaders that this negative trend can be stopped.
The representatives of historically founded religions on the European soil certainly can help much in overcoming the number of challenges that our continent is facing when the question is of the fight for the environment in which we all will feel well and safe. Every message that comes from such eminent people of faith is of great importance. The messages of peace and tolerance are, certainly, the most important ones.
The Europe of today is one of the most organised and stable parts of the world, the place where there is a high level of respect for human rights and citizens’ freedom. Yet, peace is a deceiving matter, and evil, disorder and violence are always there, in vicinity. They are waiting for a good moment to gain power and show face. Our continent has, throughout its history, older and the recent history, witnessed the most brutal violence and hatred. The dark ideologies of fascism and Stalinism were born on the European soil. The vortex of ideologically founded, technologically well organised evil have, in the name of accomplishment of some utopian heaven, created the hell on Earth, put in misery entire peoples and mocked the very core of the human dignity.
Millions of people were killed and tortured only because they belonged to some ethnic, religious or political group in the recent history. The genocide in Bosnia happened before the eyes of the world, only 16 years ago, while even today some criminals like Breivik are committing mass murders, killing innocent children in the name of their own “good” of some kind. The terrorists who falsely represent themselves as the “defenders of Islam” are killing citizens and children in Toulouse, and a few years ago in London and Madrid. The seed of evil is omnipresent.
We have to raise voice against every kind of violence, and especially that which has no end, and it has immersed in complete evil and nonsense. I speak here about that of the ethnic and religious basis. About evil which calls on good, which compromises it.
We Muslims believe that God, as He says in one of the verses of the Holy Qur’an: “has created various peoples on earth so that they would get to know each other”. That diversity is wealth. We know that we all will continue to live on this world together, next to each other or with one another, thus it is completely wrong to seek for supremacy of ones over others. Throughout the whole history, various civilisations were reaching their peaks and their downfalls, their golden and their dark days. This will be so in the future.
The European Council of Religious Leaders represents a very influential, eminent, ethically and intellectually superior community. The Council for this reason has an opportunity, but an obligation too, to do all so that we understand each other better in Europe, to learn about each other, to be of value to each other, and not to jeopardise each other. We will all, God willing, stay here and it is better that we cooperate. To get to know each other.
Dear friends and dear guests, allow me to, at the end of this address, wish you successful work and conference.
I wish you a pleasant stay in our beautiful country and our beautiful city of Sarajevo, which in full right is called the Jerusalem of Europe.
Wishing you all the best!"
41420,BiH Presidency Chairman Bakir Izetbegović attended the marking of the 20th anniversary of the creation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the 7th anniversary of the creation of,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41420&langTag=en-US,2012-04-13,"Twenty years ago, the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina brought a Decree on integration of Territorial Defence, Patriotic League and other patriotic military units into the unified military formation which was soon to carry the honourable name – Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Respected fighters of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Respected members of the Armed Forces of BiH – soldiers, officers, generals,
Respected families of the shadeeds and killed soldiers,
Dear citizens!
Assalamu alaikum and good morning!
Twenty years ago, the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina brought a Decree on integration of Territorial Defence, Patriotic League and other patriotic military units into the unified military formation which was soon to carry the honourable name – Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Army was formed in the times of the hardest historical challenges which our homeland faced in its thousand-year-old existence. It was formed in the times when the aggressor forces from the East brutally attacked Bosnia and Herzegovina and then later also from the West, in order to achieve hegemonic, great-stately aims.
The creation, strengthening and defensive-resistant military path of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a story of the conjunction of vitality and wisdom. It is the story of the vitality of our people and the wisdom of the then state and military leadership. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina defended the country, defended the freedom and honour of the Bosnians and Herzegovinians. It defended what many call the “idea of Bosnia”; the belief that people of different religions, cultures and identities can live together. That very idea is in the foundations of the unification of Europe, the creation of the European Union.
Under unbelievably complex conditions, almost complete logistical blockade and halted economy, a respectable military force was created, the force which prevailed against superior aggressor armies, prevailed against international conspiracies and embargo, prevailed against those in its ranks who wanted revenge.
The first President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the first Supreme Commander of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, late Alija Izetbegović, when he talked about the miraculous strengthening and resistance of our people and our Army, said “… once when analyses are made, when the miracle of the Bosnian resistance is deciphered from a historical distance, it will be discovered, for I am sure – that the secret laid somewhere within the souls or character of the people…”
Therefore, let us remember our heroes and that difficult, but glorious time. Let us not allow their role and significance in the history of our country and our people be forgotten! The results of their fight and their victim are the founding stone for the creation of a better future for the generations to come. We continue that fight today – the fight for the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country of free and equal people regardless of their names and regardless of the way they worship God.
Resistances, conspiracies and disintegration attempts will continue to exist. But strong integration processes, the processes of reconciliation and normalisation will unquestionably continue to gain strength and they will prevail. A well set political aims are gaining constant and stronger support of the international community. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an excellent opportunity to speed its path towards the Euro-Atlantic integrations.
In the last weeks, I was twice in Brussels. In March, I conducted meetings with the leadership of the European Union, and a few days ago I had a meeting with the Secretary General and later with the overall Council of the NATO member states.
The readiness for assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina on its accelerated path towards the European integrations was confirmed. Within a couple of months, we can create conditions for the submission of a credible application for membership to the European Union, as well as the taking over of the Annual Plan within the Action Plan for membership to NATO.
The doors of the European Union and NATO are wide open to us. The security of the NATO Alliance, the security for all in Bosnia and Herzegovina, political and economic stability which the EU membership offers – are the best possible inheritance we can leave to our children and descendants. This is the opportunity which this generation of Bosnian-Herzegovinian leaders does not have the right to miss.
Occasional crises that occur must not dishearten. It is imperative that we keep searching for solutions and come out of every crisis stronger and a step closer to the accomplishment of the set strategic goals.
A great majority of citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina are tired of uncertainty and constant contentions, and want a better life and certain future for themselves and their descendants.
The politicians have to finally rightly interpret the interests of their electorate and direct the energy towards agreement which will enable the Bosnian-Herzegovinian society to strongly move on the path of stability, prosperity and security.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Today, while we stand in front of the Second Rangers Infantry Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the regiment which proudly nourishes the inheritance of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, let us send a message to ourselves and others that the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina will never again will allow for weakness, that we will always be ready to defend our homeland.
But also, let us send a message that we are ready for agreement and cooperation. Most ready. We are ready to, while not forgetting the past, turn towards the future, towards what we can and should become, and that is the society in which every person in every part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, will peacefully live a life worthy of a man.
That is our debt to those who laid their lives in defence of one and only homeland of ours, Bosnia and Herzegovina!
To all the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina I congratulate this great day – the Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you. Cheers!"
41326,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić's address on the occasion of Independence Day of BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41326&langTag=en-US,2012-03-01,"Exactly twenty years ago, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, more precisely its majority, answered affirmatively to the Referendum question which is always useful and worth of repeating: “Do you want Bosnia and Herzegovina to be an independent state of all its citizens and equal nations?”
Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Your Excellencies!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Exactly twenty years ago, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, more precisely its majority, answered affirmatively to the Referendum question which is always useful and worth of repeating: “Do you want Bosnia and Herzegovina to be an independent state of all its citizens and equal nations?”
In the historical context of the day, it was a brave and fair question to ask. Brave because the question of independence of BiH inevitably meant facing and getting into a conflict with the brutal and bloody politics and force which had already been trampling upon and burning the regions of ex-Yugoslavia, and which had already made it clear to us that they had been against Bosnia and Herzegovina and against and any kind of equality of its peoples; and it was a fair question because, along the independence, the equality of all its peoples and citizens was implied.
If we take a closer look and think about it, we will easily notice that, in that at first sight a simple question, there were three co-related questions; three, I would say, basic concepts of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the day, Bosnia and Herzegovina of today and Bosnia and Herzegovina of the future: the question of independence, the question of equality of peoples and the question of equality of citizens. Those three questions were, and are, inextricably co-related. And it was clear then, as it is today, that if only one is missing then the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina has a problem.
Unfortunately, in the time of today, honestly speaking, something is missing.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is an independent state today. Regardless whether some liked it or not, whether they were celebrating this day as a holiday today or not, Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state exists and remains. Even the greatest opponents of Bosnia and Herzegovina today must admit this fact as reality.
However, what is it today with, so to speak, the rest of the Referendum question?
Where do we stand today when the matter is of the equality of the peoples, and of the equality of citizens in the present Bosnia and Herzegovina? The answer is, I am afraid, defeating. Nor all the peoples, nor all the citizens as individuals are equal today in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately, in the present Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is always that someone, somewhere on the territory of our country, is unequal. From that fact, the biggest political problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina derive.
A complete answer to the Referendum question of 1992 has not been given. The independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been reached, but it has not been followed with the equality of peoples and citizens. Although I do have my opinion and position on why it is like that and who is responsible or to be blamed for this being so, I do not wish to open that question now. I do not wish to open it because I find it more essential and vital to discuss how to overcome this situation, how to answer the other two remaining, questions of the 1992 Referendum – how to reach a true, not fake, farcical, equality of peoples and citizens in the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina. Do we have the strength for it?
Do we posses the will and the strength to, at least for our children if not for ourselves, ensure the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which equal people will live without fear of the unsecure future?
In today's political generation of people, to which people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have given honour and right to decide, lies a great responsibility, yet at the same time an opportunity to fully answer the 1992 Referendum question and thus fulfil the expectations of the March of 1992, and even the expectations of those who had not been born then and are our children today.
We will have the first test soon, during this year. Let us not allow the questions of Srebrenica and Mostar escalate in this year, since those two questions by far transcend the importance of the towns themselves and bear repercussions for the entire country.
It is perhaps the question of these two towns where we can show our readiness to build our country better, the country of us all Bosnians and Herzegovinians, the state of equal peoples and citizens.
Let us prove ourselves to be the people who go beyond their personal interests. Let us show that we are responsible people and politicians who will consider not only our own interests, but wishes and aspirations of those who belong to our political, ethnic, and religious or any other group. Let us think about the needs, wishes and fears of others, and not only those of “our own“alone! Let us think of our country and our future.
Twenty years, which passed very quickly, is a long time in a human life. In historical sense, it is almost unnoticeable moment.
Regardless the way you observed it, from a human or historical angle, in any way, in twenty years time, which, I repeat will pass very quickly, some other people, who will be standing here where we stand today, will appreciate us after what we have done for this country and whether we have fulfilled what the vast majority of Bosnians and Herzegovinians asked us in 1992, whether we have provided and secured independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state of equal peoples and citizens.
The answer and power to do so is today in our hands! Let us do everything for Bosnians and Herzegovinians to get what they asked for in the 1992 Referendum!
Dear Bosnians and Herzegovinians, I wish you happy 1 March, the Independence Day of our Homeland, our Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you for your attention!"
41327,Address by Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Bakir Izetbegović on the occasion of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41327&langTag=en-US,2012-03-01,"Today's date has a special place in the history of our country. On this date, two decades ago, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina determined the fate of their homeland. Sixty-four percent of these citizens voted for a sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina; a state of equal citizens and peoples – Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, as well as members of other peoples who live in it.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends,
Today's date has a special place in the history of our country.
On this date, two decades ago, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina determined the fate of their homeland. Sixty-four percent of these citizens voted for a sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina; a state of equal citizens and peoples – Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, as well as members of other peoples who live in it.
Despite that, there are still attempts to misinterpret the events of twenty years ago. But the truth is this:
Only when all attempts to reach a peaceful and democratic solution of the Yugoslav drama had been rejected – and I remind you that the most persistent and most consistent advocate of such an outcome was a late first president of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegoviæ – did the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina issue a decision to hold a referendum on independence.
That decision came at the request of the Badinter Arbitration Commission, and only after that Commission concluded that the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution, and after the boundaries of SFRY's republics were recognized as future state boundaries.
The referendum was carried out throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina in a lawful, peaceful and transparent manner, and with full international monitoring. It was a democratic and lawful act by which Bosnia and Herzegovina restored its independence and sovereignty in a dignified manner, after the centuries of foreign rule.
These days I am asked by many: Are we living in the country for which its citizens cast their votes in the referendum twenty years ago? What is its future and prospects?
In a more idealistic projection, the response to this question might be negative. But we must be realistic. Bosnia and Herzegovina has already passed the more difficult – painful and threatening – chapter of its history.
Ahead of us is the task of completing the democratic reconstruction of our country, and ensuring that future generations live in a prosperous and stable Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bosnia and Herzegovina in which all citizens are equal regardless of their religious, ethnic or political affiliation. In Bosnia and Herzegovina in which rights and reason rule.
The European path is the only realistic platform from which we can achieve the goals for which we have fought over the past twenty years.
But the question that has been posed for years and that we must finally answer is: How to faster move forward on the European path?
First and foremost, we must turn to the future, not forgetting the lessons learned from the past. Our country has a realistic prospect of making great progress in a short time. But we will seize those opportunities only when we stop wasting precious time on quarrels about what has been, and finally devote ourselves to reaching agreements about what can and should be.
Our most important mission should be to build trust. That is a painstaking process that can be accomplished only by mutual respect and understanding. To succeed, we must stop indulging in cheap populism. We must decisively break out of the worn and frayed political patterns of the past. We must correctly interpret the interests of those we represent, and listen the views of our interlocutors, no matter how different those views may be.
We must never lose sight of the big picture. We must not allow ourselves to risk defeat of the whole enterprise by getting carried away by the desire for personal victories in relatively insignificant political battles; a defeat that brings this country to a halt, causing loss to all and profit to none.
To build a future, we must make compromises.
If we have to choose between our country's prosperity and our own political ambitions, then the choice is clear: There is no political price that is too high to pay to enable our country's progress.
We must rapidly adopt the European Union acquis communautaire and implement modern European standards in all spheres of our society.
That includes building a rational and functional administrative system at all levels of government, a system that will serve the needs of this country's citizens, instead of serving itself. And for that we need, more than anything, political will. We must act more responsibly towards the duties we perform, and communicate and coordinate with each other, at all levels, better and more honestly.
In the future, before we start talking about creating a single new institution at any level of government, we must first ensure that every institution that has already been created serves its purpose and does its job. There is no point in creating new institutions if the existing ones do not work properly.
We must lead a responsible economic policy that is strategically focused on the realization of the enormous potentials and resources that our country undoubtedly has. To that aim, we must rapidly build infrastructure. Investing in infrastructure is the best way to employ our construction industry, increase trade, attract investments, and accelerate economic development.
We can build common future in this country only through agreements that respect the interests and rights of all: the state, both entities, all three constituent peoples, and all other citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That is why future reforms in this country should go neither in the direction of centralization nor in the direction of decentralization, but in the direction of integration.
We must run reform processes so that they benefit all the peoples and citizens of our country. Every step forward is possible only if it is in the common interest of all in this country.
We face many dilemmas, but one thing is certain:
History has taught us that Bosnia and Herzegovina inexorably marches forward only when all its peoples and citizens feel at home here.
The only common future that is achievable is one that is acceptable to all wellintentioned people in this country.
And that is the future in which all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina feel comfortable in one common state that gives us all security and prosperity.
To all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, my heartfelt congratulations for the Independence Day.
Thank you!"
41190,The Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the closing ceremony of the Regional Office of the Saudi High Commission in Sarajevo and the change of the name of the Amphitheatre of the Cul,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41190&langTag=en-US,2011-12-21,"Tonight’s closing ceremony of the Regional Office of the Saudi High Commission and acknowledging a genuine friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosniaks, Prince Selman bin Abdul-Aziz, after whom the Amphitheatre of the Cultural Centre “King Fahd” in Sarajevo will be called from tonight, is an opportunity for us to once more express our gratitude for all the help which Saudi Arabia gave to our country and people in the hardest moments of our defence against the aggression and the fight for survival.
Dear Mister Ambassador, dear hosts, dear friends, As-Salam-O-Alaikum and Good Evening!
Tonight’s closing ceremony of the Regional Office of the Saudi High Commission and acknowledging a genuine friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosniaks, Prince Selman bin Abdul-Aziz, after whom the Amphitheatre of the Cultural Centre “King Fahd” in Sarajevo will be called from tonight, is an opportunity for us to once more express our gratitude for all the help which Saudi Arabia gave to our country and people in the hardest moments of our defence against the aggression and the fight for survival.
My people are well aware of the exceptional role of the Saudi High Commission, which was led by esteemed Prince Selman, during its humanitarian actions in Bosnia and Herzegovina for almost twenty years.
How much importance was given to helping us is demonstrated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world which established a special commission to help the Bosniaks and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There is a large number of orphans, shaheed families, expelled Bosniaks, who can never nor ever will forget the brotherly help which was coming from Saudi Arabia.
The figures that the Saudi High Commission cared for more than 12,000 orphans, established refugee camps and directly financed the return of around 13,000 refugees, and with various forms of assistance helped more than 250,000 Bosnian-Herzegovinian families – speak for themselves. During the aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina, large quantities of necessary medical equipment were donated, wages for doctors and medical staff were being secured, and our wounded were transported and cared for in Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, during and after the war, the aid was being directed towards infrastructure reconstruction, railway networks, water and electro-energy infrastructure, building and reconstruction of schools, numerous mosques and Islamic universities...
As a mark of respect and gratitude for such devotion of our Saudi brothers, President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, my father Alija Izetbegoviæ, awarded Prince Selman bin Abdul-Aziz with the Golden Medal of Bosnia in 1997.
Tonight at this ceremony we are before all speaking about the humanitarian mission of the Saudi High Commission, but the political support and help of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in those fateful years to my country was immeasurably significant.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was one of the first in the world to recognise the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina and it strongly supported our right to defence of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and international subjectivity. I remind you that the late King Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz, together with the highest officials of Saudi Arabia, always put the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina in focus in international relations. There was no occasion where, in his contacts with the most influential world leaders, the Saudi leader did not significantly influence the forming of opinions towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. The activities of Saudi Arabia through the institutions of the United Nations, Organisation of the Islamic Conference and other most eminent international organisations contributed to the affirmation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the international scene.
Such support was also continued after the signing of the Dayton Agreement which brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina at the end of the year 1995.
Dear friends,
Tonight’s ceremony in a way marks the end of an era in the friendly relations of Saudi Arabia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our country survived, the enemies of our people did not succeed in their intentions to destroy neither the country nor the Bosniak people. Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Allah, is no longer a humanitarian case. Bosnia and the Bosniaks are offering partnership for the future. With our own hands, our intellect, abilities which we possess, through cooperation with proved friends, we have to move forward. Friends from Saudi Arabia have their irreplaceable place and role in such our future. Now we need to cooperate on the economic basis and to mutual benefit. Some Saudi investors are already here, in our country. Sulaiman al-Shiddi is building the most modern centre in our country. He reconstructed Hotel “Bristol”, one of the symbols of Sarajevo, and is also planning other projects. This year’s Sarajevo Business Forum was also attended by His Excellency Saudi Minister of Finance Ibrahim el-Assaf. The Saudi businessmen and the representatives of the Saudi Fund for Development were also here. The economic relations need to be strengthened. There are projects, especially in agriculture, tourism, energy, and engineering, which can be attractive to Saudi businesspeople. Together we need to continue to work on this plan. There are of course bureaucratic obstacles, but we will be removing these in the period ahead.
Tonight’s ceremony is particularly emotional for me. It reminded me of the hard times of the war and the fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the days when friendships were formed and strengthened, as is the friendship with the people of Saudi Arabia and our country. And the waqf in which building we are tonight, witness our brotherly relations, and it will be left for the generations to come who will nurture and cherish these relations.
Long live the brotherhood of the Saudi and Bosnian people!
Thank you!"
41136,The address of BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the official Opening Ceremony of the First Congress of the Islamic Religion Teachers of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41136&langTag=en-US,2011-12-03,"The idea to organise a Congress of the Islamic Religion Teachers is to be praised. That is the best way to improve your work on preserving then values which you are passing down to the new generations through the exchange of the experiences. In the turbulent world which this generation will inherit, a renaissance of the faith will be needed more than ever before.
Dear Reisu-l-ulema,
Dear Chairman of the Islamic Community Parliament,
Dear Teachers, brothers and sisters, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Assalam -o-Alaikum and good morning!
The idea to organise a Congress of the Islamic Religion Teachers is to be praised. That is the best way to improve your work on preserving then values which you are passing down to the new generations through the exchange of the experiences. In the turbulent world which this generation will inherit, a renaissance of the faith will be needed more than ever before.
The development of the events at the beginning of the XXI Century is getting at the new dynamics and acceleration which are beyond any reasonable predictions. Indeed, who could have predicted such changes in the Islamic World and Europe at the beginning of this year? An explosion of freedom like this in the East and an implosion of the kind of the economic power and organisation in, at first sight, boringly sable Europe?
I went to Brussels a couple of days ago, and I had an opportunity to talk with important people from the European Institutions and gain the first hand information.
I do not wish to exaggerate, but I must warn you; the situation in the EU is not good, the crisis has entered into its dramatic phase.
If the solutions are not found in the week to follow, the Eurozone is threatened by a quake of uncertain consequences.
Greece has, as you probably know, experienced a full economic and social collapse; millions of people are there in the streets of Great Britain; unemployment rate in Spain is reaching unimaginable percentages; a financial break threatens Italy; France has been preparing itself for a similar scenario... In all this, as if German European leadership seems to be losing its strength.
We will wait, naturally, to see what the Governments of the key European states are going to do, yet we need to observe the things now with the greatest responsibility possible and seriously observe and analyse from an angle of their possible reflections and consequences on our region and our country.
Last night, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated with regrets that Serbia has not fulfilled all the conditions to gain the EU candidate status. The reason is Kosovo and the local conflicts with the International forces.
That will for certain weaken the democratic government of Boris Tadić and will serve as a fuel to the extreme forces in Serbia. Such a scenario is not good for the region which may be stopped on the path of stabilisation, reintegration and reconciliation.
It is in the past year, on this plan precisely, that we have vested in much effort and reached quite solid initial results. Only the brave leaders, those who do not indulge the masses, can change the state of spirit in the region. With the Presidents Tadić and Josipović I have had many meetings in the past thirteen months, we have established a good communication, and agreed on the most important strategic determinations on the path of our countries towards the EU and NATO.
A good basis has been created for us to continue solving open questions left from the times of the dissolution of Yugoslavia as the border question is, as well as the use of mutual resources, solving the property – legal disputes among the states.... The development of the situation threatens to halt the positive trends.
The question is how much the crisis in Europe is going to reflect on the processes started in the region. I wish to believe that we will have a chance to finalise the work we started to the benefit of all the states and peoples on this unstable Balkan of ours.
Yet, those wishing to move things towards the opposite direction are not without plans, neither public nor secret. In the region, there are political leaders with unhidden goals acting faced towards the past. They poison the public space, spread fear, manipulate with the stories on people being jeopardised, and on those bases they seek for new divisions and conflicts.
These disintegration forces are far weaker than the integration forces, but the crisis in the Euro zone, which I have already spoken about, the weakening of the cohesion forces in the European Union, could suit these destructive tendencies and their bearers.
In that sense, we must be ready for various challenges. The closest history and the experience, I hope, have taught us not to leave anything to chance.
Our state Bosnia and Herzegovina and our Bosniak people are exposed almost on daily basis to verbal denial, provocations, and even unhidden calls for the dissolution of the country through some alleged peaceful parting.
That is why we need to be united, politically responsible, and ready to answer to the challenges of that kind. Naturally, via democratic means, legal and institutional actions, we will not allow the constitutional order of the country to be brought into question, nor shall we allow physical existence of our people to be endangered.
As far as the development of the events is concerned, the revolution in the Islamic world, they had been predicted by someone. They were well described by Alija Izetbegoviæ in 1970, as if he had seen them from the close distance. And when dust started falling on his writings, when we had almost forgotten about them, the educated, libertarian generation of young Arabs started to break the chains of the dictatorship as they were threads. I quote: “The entire Islamic world is in the state of changes. No matter what this world will look like after these changes have passed through the opening upward round, one thing is certain: it shall no more be the world from the first half of this century. The epoch of passivity and stillness has passed forever.... Because one world with 700 million people (for, 40 years ago there were almost half less Muslims than today) and with huge natural resources and in a geographic position of the first order, which is a heir of the colossal cultural and political tradition, and a bearer of the living Islamic mission, that world cannot for long stay in the position of a hireling. There is no such a force which could prevent a new Muslim generation to bring such an abnormal condition to an end...”
We belong to the religion which will obviously mark the XXI Century. The religion which will have to stand against the greedy exhaustion of the substance of the human kind of the planet we live on. It will have to stand against the attacks on the system of values set by the Word of God and Order, to stop the collision of the moral system, destruction of family, disappearance of the humane inter-human relations. In the analyses of economic experts, the exclusive wish for the material goods is identified as a fundamental cause of the global crisis which is beginning to shake the whole world. Eminent sociologists call for forgotten mutual solidarity, and people from around go out to the streets, dramatically warning of the fact that there is less and less justice and perspective in societies they live in.
We belong to a small but proud Bosniak people. The people who are small in number, but great in courage and determinations and choices which we made on the recent historical crossroads. The people who chose freedom, and for unequal fight which that freedom required. And the people chose faith, an upward road, when it was easier to go downwards. The historical burden did not break the backbone of the Bosniak people, it made them stronger.
We belong to good people, and we have an obligation before it. All of us who which to strengthen and consolidate the Bosniaks, have an obligation to strengthen, before all, ourselves; to strengthen ourselves through mutual harmony, respect, cooperation, but also through constant education, perfecting and gaining new knowledge.
The spiritual, an by that physical existence and progress of Bosniaks in the times to come, is unreachable without a strong network of well educated religious teachers. It is therefore necessary for you to understand the job you do primarily as a mission, and then as a profession.
Dear religious teachers, I wish you success in the work of the Congress, God's help and success in the noble work and mission which you chose and dedicated yourselves to.
In the human and political capacity, I will always be there with you, opening doors for your actions protecting them from the pressures from those who do not, or do not wish to understand the irreplacable role of the faith and spirituality in the times to come.
Sallam and all the best!"
41131,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s Address at the Official Military Ceremony on the occasion of the Day of the Armed Forces of BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41131&langTag=en-US,2011-12-01,"It is my particular pleasure to, on behalf of BiH Presidency, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, and in my own name, address you today, on the 6th Anniversary of the Armed Forces of BiH. The December 1, the Day of the Armed Forces, is the day for us to be reminded of the contribution of many who vested their knowledge, hard work, efforts and expertise in the process of forming the Armed Forces of BiH.
Dear Excellencies, Generals,
Officers, NCOs,
Soldiers, dear guests!
It is my particular pleasure to, on behalf of BiH Presidency, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, and in my own name, address you today, on the 6th Anniversary of the Armed Forces of BiH.
The December 1, the Day of the Armed Forces, is the day for us to be reminded of the contribution of many who vested their knowledge, hard work, efforts and expertise in the process of forming the Armed Forces of BiH.
Today I will repeat what I have many times said, and that is that the Armed Forces of BiH are a better part of BiH society and that from day to day, they precisely show the way how successful reforms should be conducted in our country.
BiH Armed Forces are the best indicator of how BiH can and must function jointly and united, and in this respect you can serve as an example to other structures of our society and state.
Members of the Armed Forces of BiH, on a daily basis do all in their power to, as efficiently and professionally as possible conduct and execute the concrete tasks and the necessary reforms alike. It is for this reason that the state of BiH must be the one to provide and assure for them all assets necessary for the functioning and work, in accordance with NATO standards.
Every day, we witness how significant of a reform step was the forming of the united Armed Forces for a better future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Being ahead in the reform of Defence, where we have gone the furthest, to the joy of us all, is a strong and positive message to all in Bosnia and Herzegovina. If that could happen in the field of Defence and Security, i.e. there where it was realistic to expect biggest issues after the war, then rightfully we may and must be optimists and hope for the improvement in other areas and fields of BiH society.
The process of forming and reforms in BiH Armed Forces is an example of a successful reform in our society, which gives the right to be sure that the reform will continue, yet we must not forget that it was a complicated process, which required much of the optimism, vision, decisiveness and patience.
It is familiar to all of us that, after a conditional NATO MAP was accepted, our obligation was determined to register the prospective military locations from the list of 69 facilities, which, unfortunately, has not been done to date. At this moment, there is a halt in this process due to the reasons of daily-political reasons, but I hope that there will be improvements in this area at soonest, since there is an extensive spectrum of reforms and obligations before us in reaching the Standards of NATO, which will lead us to NATO membership.
On this occasion I wish to again express hope that in the future, at one of the ceremonies of marking the Day of BiH Armed Forces to follow, I will address you as members of the Armed Forces member of NATO.
I also wish to point out that the Armed Forces of BiH, within their power and capabilities, give their contribution through the engagement in joint activities of Peace and Stability Operations in the areas of crisis around the World.
For everything we have done, today, on the Day of the Armed Forces, I give credit to all members of BiH Armed Forces who are active participants in the process of reforms. I am sure that BiH Ministry of Defence and BiH Armed Forces will in the future, on the principles of democratic openness and co-operation, give their contribution and do all necessary for BiH to become equal member of democratic family of European states.
Ladies and Gentlemen, once again, on behalf of BiH Presidency and in my own name, I wish luck and a lot of success to the Members of BiH Armed Forces and their families in the work and life ahead.
I thank you."
41133,Bakir Izetbegović’s address at the opening of the 5th Congress of Nurses and Technicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina with International participation,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41133&langTag=en-US,2011-12-01,"This Congress is an important event and it is truly an honour to me to be here with you tonight. The profession of nursing is more than a profession; it is one of the most humane occupations, which asks for dedication and devotion, courage and willingness to sacrifice.
Dear nurses, medical technicians, dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends!
This Congress is an important event and it is truly an honour to me to be here with you tonight.
The profession of nursing is more than a profession; it is one of the most humane occupations, which asks for dedication and devotion, courage and willingness to sacrifice.
It was said nicely here this evening – you are there with the people from their first moments after the birth to the days of sorrows and parting from this world.
You are there with the people in their hardest moments; when the help to them is of the most necessity, necessary to stand the pain and illness more easily.
Thus, it is precisely you who are like the closest members of the family to them; they turn to you with the greatest trust and closeness, expecting from you plenty of care, patience and strength.
Naturally, altruistic line is there at the heart of the profession of nursing, yet without good education there can be no good professionals.
Do we as a society dedicate enough attention to the field of education? To this question, you too will probably offer answers at this congress.
In any case, the health system in our country, compared to those in the neighbouring states and Europe, is one of the better segments of the society and the state.
Though they are sharing the majority of the problems we all are facing; though the economic crisis and recession has not avoided them – the personnel in the health care have been marking successes and have been keeping the pace with the developed countries. It has been proved that we have good physicians – both in war and peace. We do truly have good medical professionals.
At times, however, as if we are not aware of it, the people we educated leave, attracted by better incomes, offered in other countries.
Regardless the lowered capacities of the post-war society, we must not allow the stagnation in the health care. We must jointly keep trying to find ways for doctors, medical nurses and technicians to have the position in the society they evidently deserve.
The health system in our country, primarily in the Federation of BiH, has still been going through a dynamic period of all-encompassing reforms and we all together need to contribute to the quality of the changes which will make us part of the developed Europe in this field.
It is therefore that I believe that this Congress will also give a significant contribution to seeking for the answers and good solutions in the process of reforming of the health sector, in accordance with our strategic objectives and the highest standards of the developed world.
In the end, I wish to express my support to the plans for Bosnia and Herzegovina to soon get its own Chamber of Nurses which would become a full member for the European and World Association of Nurses and Nursing.
I bid you a successful Congress and a successful continuation of your noble mission.
Cheers!"
41111,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41111&langTag=en-US,2011-11-24,"Every year Bosnia and Herzegovina, or to be honest and precise, a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, marks the 25th November as the Day of Statehood of the Homeland. And that being one of the most important days, related to the antifascist fight which took place in our country but also over the entire ex-Yugoslavia.
Dear citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Your Excellencies, Eminencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends!
Every year Bosnia and Herzegovina, or to be honest and precise, a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, marks the 25th November as the Day of Statehood of the Homeland. And that being one of the most important days, related to the antifascist fight which took place in our country but also over the entire ex-Yugoslavia.
That fight was bloody, sometimes desperate, ruthless...! All great battles led by the partisan units during the Second World War in the area of ex-Yugoslavia occurred on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It can thus be freely said that the very core of the partisan resistance to the German Nazis and Italian Fascists, as well as other occupying forces, and also domestic Nazis and fascists during the Second World War, was in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Here, I am deliberately talking about the partisans and partisan units, and not about the communists and the Communist Party of then, because those two are not the same. Not all of the partisans and fighters against Nazis and fascists were communists, but the fact is that at the head of the organised fight against Nazism and fascism still were the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and Josip Broz Tito.
During those times, the times that can freely be called the times of struggle for bare life and survival, along with the armed fight, other key political things took place which directly or indirectly marked Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period after the Second World War, including the times of today.
The Session of ZAVNOBiH in the town of Mrkonjić-Grad in 1943 and the gathering of the antifascists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were not exclusively communists, returned, and I repeat, “returned“ and not gave historical and political right to Bosnia and Herzegovina to even today, after all, be called a state!
The State and Homeland of all of us together, and not more someone's than someone else's, and that each one of us has a right to the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For the sake of the truth, it should hereby be mentioned that then, as in the partisan movement, as also in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, there were those who thought, wished and spoke for the idea that Bosnia and Herzegovina should disappear as a political, social and geographical fact. Furthermore, it should be sincerely said that, with his authority, the whole thing was overturned to BiH favour, by Josip Broz Tito.
What I have said is not a matter of my personal stance or opinion, but is about “bare“ facts and listing of those.
If anybody is not clear why the 25 November should be respected as an important date for BiH and ZAVNOBIH, let him just look back at the above mentioned facts which can simply be collected into four notions, or, illustratively said, four words only:
“Bosnia and Herzegovina, freedom, antifascism and equality!“
Order then in any way you wish, but to me, they carry the same weight and meaning, and it is absolutely of no importance to me in which order I state them.
Every attempt to jeopardise or give up on any of these notions, and thus to give up on everything that 25th November 1943 represents, causes great problems and troubles, including the war horrors in BiH at the end of the last Century, as in our homeland, as in the whole region.
Our generations have bitter, traumatic and tragic memory of the attempt to endanger or give up on the values of ZAVNOBiH and the 25th November.
In 1992, from the outside, outside of BiH, the values of ZAVNOBiH were endangered. Outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some attempted to simply erase the 25th November and ZAVNOBiH, and BiH, and our freedom, and antifascism and our equality, as if they had never existed. Naturally, we defended ourselves, just as anyone else sane would. We defended everything we believe in, we defended BiH, we defended freedom, we defended antifascism, and we defended the right to be equal.
Unfortunately, those from the outside had their allies in BiH, allies in those who gave up on the 25th November and on the ZAVNOBiH, and on BiH, and on freedom, and on antifascism, and on equality.
In those who gave up on all of this together or just some of the values of 25th November 19433 and ZAVNOBiH.
Those from the „outside“ are no longer there. They got what historically belongs to them, and what they deserved. If perhaps in the future time the similar ones emerge, I sincerely hope that they will not ever again, they will encounter the same fate as their predecessors and will end in similar way.
But those domestic ones are still there! Those who gave up or are ready to give up on Bosnia and Herzegovina, freedom, antifascism and equality, ultimately to give up on the 25th November and ZAVNOBiH. What I am going to say now, I will say because of our foreign friends, who are being called these days not to attend this reception nor the marking of 25th November, but also to make some things clearer, if they have not been already. Just observe the aim the relation to the 25th November and ZAVNOBiH in BiH carries. Observe the aim of relation towards BiH, towards freedom, towards antifascism, towards equality. Observe and much, if not all of it will become much clearer. It will be clear to you why Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have the Council of Ministers in accordance with the electoral results, and its Constitution; why Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot move forward towards NATO and the EU; why Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot implement the Decision regarding the fundamental human rights; why in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are still fascism and chauvinism; why are we still digging up the mass graves; why there is no bare, bitter truth on the war crimes committed; why are we bickering and arguing, etc..
Observe, in BiH, just the relation towards the 25th November, ZAVNOBiH and their values, and all will be crystal clear, if you wish it be so. And if you do not, no harm done! There are still those of us, and there will surely be more of us, who care about Bosnia and Herzegovina, freedom, antifascism, equality and the 25th November. And we will not lose hope in our wish and the attempt for this country, named Bosnia and Herzegovina to be and remain whole, free, antifascist, democratic state of equal peoples, equal on the whole of its territory. Think about what you believe in and what you think about all of this.
And then, only tell us how we are all the same!
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Happy 25 November, the Statehood Day of our Homeland!
Thank you!"
41114,Address by BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović at the reception on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=41114&langTag=en-US,2011-11-24,"First of all, I would like to thank you for your presence with which you express your respect and deference to one of the most important dates in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina – 25th November which we are officially celebrating as Statehood Day. The essence of our country is the idea of antifascism, unity, equality, respect for others and those who are different during the centuries-long colourfulness of our differences.
Dear Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear friends!
First of all, I would like to thank you for your presence with which you express your respect and deference to one of the most important dates in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina – 25th November which we are officially celebrating as Statehood Day.
The essence of our country is the idea of antifascism, unity, equality, respect for others and those who are different during the centuries-long colourfulness of our differences.
It is precisely these noble general human visions that led the participants of the Session of ZAVNOBIH in Mrkonjić Grad, i.e. Varcar-Vakuf exactly 68 years ago.
In those difficult and fateful times of the Second World War, the fighters against the fascist evil strengthened the foundations of Bosnian statehood confirming the historical-legal continuity of our country with the proclamation of full equality of its constituent peoples.
Half a century later, Bosnia and Herzegovina would again be a target to fascists who wanted to divide it and erase it from the World map. Thank God, they did not succeed in their attempt. They committed tremendous evils, yet the people of this country, Bosnian-Herzegovinian anti-fascists, with the help from allies and friends, from the East and the West, succeeded in defending it.
The country is saved, preserved for the generations which, I am certain, will make it better and more prosperous.
Fifty-two years after the first Session of ZAVNOBIH (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), in November of 1995, at the other end of the planet, in the American military base in Dayton, an agreement was reached to stop the war, and once again confirmed the international- legal subjectivity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In essence, along the confirmation of the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the seal was put in Dayton on all principles we have been cherishing since the times of ZAVNOBIH, with a strong affirmation of human rights and a resolute refusal of any kind of discrimination.
Unfortunately, the price of peace was the acceptance of imperfect internal organisation of the country and division into two entities. Still, with all its disadvantages, the Dayton Agreement created space for the reconstruction of the destroyed cities and villages, reintegration of the state, reconciliation of peoples and establishment of democratic system of the rule of Law within the Internationally recognised borders.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Almost seventeen years have passed since the renewal of the statehood of BiH. Next year we will mark two decades since the proclamation of independence.
Where is Bosnia and Herzegovina going; what are the perspectives of our country and society?
With certainty, we can say that the harder and more painful part of the road is behind us. There will be, of course, more crisis and halts on our path towards the community of free democratic states of the EU and NATO. Yet, this path is evident.
The process of normalization of the situation will be continued, trends leading to stability and full recovery of the society will prevail. Ordinary people will increasingly lead key processes, the integration trends will prevail. No further divisions are possible nor will they happen.
And at the end – the question when this date will be officially marked on the whole of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I do not have a sure answer. Yet, I am sure that love towards the homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina will grow further on all its sides, in all its cities and villages…. We will have a national anthem which we will sing with joy, cheering our national sports teams. And we will have dates which we will celebrate together!
I am convinced that the Day of ZAVNOBIH will be one of these dates!
Once more, to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I congratulate the Statehood Day!
I thank all of you who have honoured us with your presence at our gala reception.
Cheers!"

Your Excellencies
President Tadić
President Josipović
President Vujanović
Dear Mr. Füle,
Dear representatives of the institutions and the civil society
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is my particular pleasure to speak here, today, at the 22nd Session of the Igman Initiative which is dedicated to the topic of the European Perspective, Cooperation and Stability of the region. It is important that the civil society follows the work of the institutions of our states in the process of stabilization and accession to the European Union. It is of particular importance to talk about all the challenges on this path at such a meeting of the people coming from different segments of the society and different states.
The states we come from are there at different stages of the process of association. The Republic of Croatia has successfully finalized association negotiations; Serbia is going to get a candidate status; Montenegro is getting a date for the beginning of the negotiations of accession to the EU, and I believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina will submit the EU candidate status application by the end of the year.
It is my opinion that there is no alternative to European integrations for Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor for the region. We cannot stay outside this process if we yearn for social and economic development and better standards for our citizens. However, the government structures of a state alone cannot be integrated into the EU but the society as a whole and due to this it is good that the non-governmental sector wishes to play an active and constructive role.
We must start investing into science, research and technology development. We must do more on a balanced economical development of the regions neglected. The sooner we start establishing the system in our society and adopting the standards of the EU, the sooner we will be closer to the EU membership. We must not understand the process of the EU integrations as something we are doing for the foreigners, but for ourselves and the future of our children.
Yet, there is a sequence of challenges ahead of us. For the region, as well as for BiH. Our mutual relations, at the level of the Heads of the States, are an example of how the regional co-operation should look like in every given field. It is so for we are sharing a common vision of the Western Balkans as a constituting part of the EU, since it is for our mutual co-operation on creating the stability in the region that opens the European perspective. Yet, it is in my opinion that the Governments of our states must intensify the activities on solving the issues, at both the bilateral and multilateral level. I wish to repeat here that I think that the principle of solidarity and mutual support is a fundamental principle on which the four countries should build common European future.
The challenges before BiH in the process of stabilization and association are at the level of political relations within BiH where there is no unified stance on the method, speed and the priorities in that process. It is about the question of jurisdiction in the reform implementation between the levels of authorities of the entities and BiH. Besides these, there is an issue of capacity of our administration and the constitutional framework which is of the extreme complicity. Finally, co-operation and implementation of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in the process of establishing a functional state are of the extreme importance for all willing to become a part of the EU.
At the end I wish to thank the organizers of the Session who made it possible for us to talk about these, promote European values and openly talk about the problems we are having on that mutual path. I believe that this will bring to a better mutual understanding in the process of EU integrations."
40996,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić held speech at the opening ceremony of the Third Forum of the Ministers of Health,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40996&langTag=en-US,2011-10-13,"It is my particular pleasure to have the opportunity to address you at the Opening of the Third Forum of the Ministers of Health, which is held in BiH and for which I hope to bear certain results in the end. In the past ten years, the Network has contributed to the co-operation and mutual improvement through implementation of the regional projects in various fields, as for instance the field of Mental Health, Food Safety, neonatal Health and others.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, officials of the Governments of the network and Partners,
Dear Guests,
It is my particular pleasure to have the opportunity to address you at the Opening of the Third Forum of the Ministers of Health, which is held in BiH and for which I hope to bear certain results in the end. In the past ten years, the Network has contributed to the co-operation and mutual improvement through implementation of the regional projects in various fields, as for instance the field of Mental Health, Food Safety, neonatal Health and others.
I hope that this, Banja Luka Forum, will provide a chance for even better co-operation of the Health Network with other sectors and it will be pointed at the influence of the other sectors on the health, and vice versa. The joint actions are very important which will bring not only to the improvement of health of an individual, yet the society as a whole. It is a precondition for an economic and any other development of the society. The Health Network has proved the importance of the Health Sector in the process of trust regaining amongst the professionals and citizens, and pointed that there is a certain importance of the Health Sector in the process of reconciliation. It should be born in mind that this particular Network was one of the first which were created after the war in the region and the difficult social and economical situation in which the majority of population of the region was found. The foundation and the work of the Network alone have proved that there is no other way but the way of co-operation between states if willing to move forward. There is an example of Bulgaria and Romania, which today are the EU members, and which are also the Network members.
It is my pleasure that the Third Forum is held in Banja Luka, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a hope that this Forum will provide a clear guidance for the development of the Health Sector in co-operation with other Sectors, yet with other Networks and the Initiatives of the similar kind. When we look back at the first Forum, held in Dubrovnik in 2001, when the countries of the Region expressed their readiness to co-operate in the field of Health, and when it was decided to create the Network, over the Second Forum, held in Skopje, which brought to strengthening of the Network, now in Banja Luka we have an opportunity to see that the Network has justified its existence and that it, when the membering countries are concerned, came out the framework of the South East Europe. I hope that, along with Israel, who was accepted to be a member, other states will recognize the importance of such co-operation and approach to the Network.
Regarding the perspectives and goals of the states in the region states, the full membership is at the first place, and the Network is one of the tools that could accelerate this path. Due to all of these reasons, many countries have recognized the importance of this initiative and one of the positive aspects of the Network is its openness which makes the enlargement possible for all the states willing to exchange their experience and jointly work on the promotion of the importance of health.
There are many positive things in the countries of the region in the field of health, and they must be mentioned at this and similar sessions. We know that Croatia is the third country in Europe in the field of transplantations, right after Spain and Portugal. Our country of BiH has a developed system of rehabilitation in the Community for Physical and Mental Health – an example of the organisation of the services for mental health in a community is an example recognised by the WHO. We, as a state, offered assistance in this field to the new authorities in Libya, for we think that the Health Sector is one of the sectors which can help in a large capacity to all of us in the positive promotion of BiH and its experts.
Of course, there are certain parts where it is needed for additional efforts to be made in order to reach improvement. Here, before all, I think of insufficient legal adjustments, small scattered markets which are largely abused by the pharmaceutical industry and insufficient co-operation in building a system of fight against new challenges to the health, epidemics as the bird flu etc. I am certain that jointly you are going to find the solutions and answers for these disadvantages. In order not to take much more of your precious time, I once again whish you welcome and a pleasant stay in BiH and Banja Luka, as well as successful work. I thank you."

I always look forward to being in working Zenica, a town which is, thank God, speedily developing. I have many friends here, I know the way of life here but I also know how, under difficult conditions, new values are created and how it is fought for own prosperity and progress of the community.
Dear Hosts, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Guests!
It is a great pleasure to be with you today. I always look forward to being in working Zenica, a town which is, thank God, speedily developing. I have many friends here, I know the way of life here but I also know how, under difficult conditions, new values are created and how it is fought for own prosperity and progress of the community.
Apart from the known internal problems, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the majority of countries in the region are suffering from negative effects of global recessional trends, financial and economic crises which are affecting Europe.
But this gathering, 18th of its kind, ZEPS Fair, and the Eighth Specialised Fair of Metals ZEPS INTERMETAL, which gathered together an impressive number of national and international exhibitors are a proof that businesspeople are stronger than problems which they face.
This is why I believe that we, the politicians, whom you are rightly sometimes angry with, have an important obligation towards the business community to make way to courageous, decisive and creative managers, real leaders of progress. Only together, with a little will and a lot of cooperation, we can make Bosnia and Herzegovina a success story of 21st Century.
In my political vision, in my state contacts with presidents of friendly countries, economy is always one of the dominant topics. In that sense, regional cooperation is one of the priorities. We have to develop more intense economic relations with Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro.
The great and the strong have long ago joined up, why wouldn’t us, less developed ones, join forces and act together in global markets. Although we have inherited some political disagreements, we should be led by mutual interest in economy and we should be able to soon agree in this field.
When the future is concerned, the common European perspective is clear. When we will enter the European Union, is something we alone are deciding on. Some European funds are already made available to us and we have to use them in the reform processes.
We have to attract foreign investors, we have to help rather than hinder them with stringent bureaucracy. However, our diplomacy also must be more active and penetrating, particularly in the field of economy and opening of doors to our companies for businesses abroad.
Libya is one of the good examples which I wish to mention here. In the risky period of the local crisis, we managed to preserve the property of BiH firms and the contracted work of our companies. As soon as the conditions for it are reached, I intend to visit this friendly country with a large group of business people.
Dear friends,
Bosnia and Herzegovina has quality people and huge resources which will enable it to enter the company of the prosperous countries of the world. And, with your engagement, you are significantly contributing to the creation of conditions for this. Once more, I am honoured and I thank you for the invitation. I wish you success in your work and networking, as well as many new contracts.
I hereby promulgate the 18th ZEPS Fair and 8th INTERMETAL Fair open!

40929,"Address by Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the General Debate of the 66th Session of the United Nations General Assembly",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40929&langTag=en-US,2011-09-22,"Allow me to express my gratitude for all the cooperation and the support we received during Bosnia and Herzegovina’s membership in the UN Security Council, which will expire in few months. Speaking of our membership in the UN Security Council, let me once again reiterate the view that the presence and participation of ""small states"", such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the work and decisions of the United Nations Security Council is particularly important for maintaining balance within the Council.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentleman,
It is a great honor to address the General Assembly today, in the capacity of the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Allow me, at the very outset, to congratulate you, Mr. President, as well as members of the Bureau of the 66th Session of the General Assembly on your election, and to express our full support to your future work. Furthermore, I would like to congratulate H.E. Joseph Deiss, on the results achieved during his presiding over the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly, in a period when this body, as well as the international community in general were facing an array of challenges related to current global issues.
I am especially honored to extend congratulations to the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki Moon, for his unanimous re-election as the UN Secretary General. Over the past five years, Mr. Moon has worked tirelessly to address the various issues facing the world organization. We wish the Secretary General to continue with these activities in his second term.
Mr. President,
Allow me to express my gratitude for all the cooperation and the support we received during Bosnia and Herzegovina’s membership in the UN Security Council, which will expire in few months. Speaking of our membership in the UN Security Council, let me once again reiterate the view that the presence and participation of ""small states"", such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the work and decisions of the United Nations Security Council is particularly important for maintaining balance within the Council. This way, along with the permanent members of the Security Council and the world powers, other countries also have a chance to express their views and participate in Security Council decisions making on important issues of international peace and security. It was our pleasure and honor to work together with all members of the UN Security Council, during our mandate for 2010 and 2011.
Bosnia and Herzegovina had the honor to chair the UN Security Council during the January 2011. Although chairing the Council is only one segment of the two-year experience in the UN Security Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina once again has proved that it can be an equal partner on the international diplomatic scene, and respond to variety of obligations arising from chairing the UN Security Council.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has played a constructive role in the work of the UN Security Council, through contributing to a better, more efficient and faster response of the Security Council to situations that could threaten international peace. Furthermore, Bosnia and Herzegovina has also aimed to share its own experiences in post-conflict peace-building, and actively contribute to a better and long-lasting understanding and reconciliation. Through its role in the Security Council Bosnia and Herzegovina showed that it can be an equal and competent partner in international relations.
The UN Security Council Thematic Debate on ""Post-conflict peace-building: institution building"", which initiated by Bosnia and Herzegovina, have reached a number of conclusions. I would like to some of those conclusions at this time:
-To enable the success of peace-building initiatives, a priority must be given to institution building; this will prevent a return to conflict and ensure the survival, renewed credibility and legitimacy of the states.
-However, the purpose of institution building is to progressively reduce dependence on the international community and promote sustainability. In any case, the ownership of the reform process is the main condition for the establishment of effective institutions and ensuring sustainable peace.
-Ultimately, success in post-conflict institution building depends primarily on establishing a partnership between the international community and post-conflict societies, a partnership that is based on a set of common goals.
Bearing in this mind we would like once again, to thank you all for the confidence you have shown us and the support you provided during the non-permanent membership of my country in the UN Security Council.
Bosnia and Herzegovina also continues to provide concrete contribution to the UN peace operations in Liberia, Sudan, Cyprus and DR Congo.
Mr. President,
In Bosnia and Herzegovina we are united in our determination to pursue the path of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards full membership in European Union, and this fact represents a solid basis for the achievement of this goal.
Bosnia and Herzegovina places special emphasis on regional and sub-regional cooperation and dialogue between the neighboring countries, which represent different cultures and traditions, present in the Balkans for centuries.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to the future and cooperation with neighboring countries, based on the principles of mutual respect and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
We are interested to share our experiences with others and to develop mutually beneficial relations in post-conflict peace building, based on mutual respect for differences which in our opinion, represent an advantage.
Mr. President,
I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize that the issues of neighborly and regional cooperation are closely related to the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the EU and NATO, a strategic and high priority foreign policy objective for my country.
For us, this is the best and the only way to ensure stability, security, as well as the economic development and prosperity for all citizens of BiH.
The strategic goal of establishing formal relations and EU membership is based on the aspirations of Bosnia and Herzegovina to achieve the full functioning of our own institutions and further development of society, based on the principles of free market, rule of law and especially the protection of human rights.
Furthermore, my country wants to improve relations with the states of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and Oceania, at the multilateral and bilateral level, in accordance with the common interests and real possibilities. Bosnia and Herzegovina was and still remains dedicated to principle of openness in cooperation with all the countries in the world.
Mr. President,
Many important world events occurred between the two General Assembly sessions.
Bosnia and Herzegovina follows the development of the situation in the friendly Arab countries that are affected by deep social and political changes with great attention, preoccupation and concern. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports democratic processes towards creation of free, democratic and prosperous societies.
However, such processes are often followed by tragic consequences. Therefore, we appeal once again to stop violence and create the peace in these societies.
We are deeply concerned by standstill in crisis resolution in the Middle East. Despite optimistic announcements and plans, expected peace process has not yet been revived.
The only way forward is the solution based on the principle of peaceful coexistence of two sovereign states: a viable and independent Palestine and a stable and secure Israel, with respect to the provisions of international law and instruments in the field of humanitarian law and human rights.
So far, the UN has supported and actively participated in creating a positive atmosphere in order to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that conditions for a lasting and just solution can be achieved with additional political will and responsibility of the negotiating parties.
We are witnesses that international community’s determination to deal with terrorism and at the same time to create conditions for peaceful development of Afghanistan offers some results. However, we must conclude that it will take much more effort to establish self sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan. In April of 2010, as a sign of support to the international community activities, Bosnia and Herzegovina has issued a decision on sending an infantry unit to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
I would like to emphasize here that Bosnia and Herzegovina is still very concerned about terrorist attacks, which take innocent civilian victims in many countries around the world.
Bearing in mind that the modern world continues to face various forms of international terrorism, I express our support for full implementation of the UN Strategy for Combating Terrorism and the activities of the Committee in the Fight Against Terrorism. In this regard, let me repeat that Bosnia and Herzegovina is unconditionally dedicated to the fight against terrorism and particularly actively participates in cooperation with the countries of our region to raise the security level and preparedness for effective prevention of terrorist acts. Completing negotiations and adoption of the UN Comprehensive Terrorism Convention would be an important contribution in this field.
Mr. President,
In addition to the crisis of political issues, this year we are faced again with many other problems to which international community still lacks proper and effective responses.
Despite signs of recovery, unfortunately, I must say that the greatest economic and financial crisis in recent history has left visible consequences that are reflecting on global peace and security. It is more than obvious that countries individually cannot cope with this issue, no matter how efficient their governments may be. Global crisis seeks global solutions.
In the context of the United Nations activities, we must face the fact that the greatest economic crisis, since the foundation of the World Organization, has in some degree threatened and even has began to question the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, one of the most comprehensive strategic tasks set by the World Organization since its establishment.
Therefore, individually and collectively it is necessary to do everything in order to prevent further erosion of this key strategic project.
We believe that it is necessary for international community to redouble its efforts, especially the UN, in order to assist primarily the least developed countries.
Mr. President,
The climate change problem caused by human activities leads to natural changes that can have catastrophic consequences for the entire mankind, if the agreement process on environmental protection is not intensified.
Bosnia and Herzegovina shares the concern of the most UN members that droughts, floods, sea level rise, lack of running water and food, deforestation and all other phenomena caused by global warming are a serious threat to the world security, which in the future could be a cause of conflict all over the world.
Therefore, extremely important climate change issue requires urgent action by the international community. Bosnia and Herzegovina has expressed interest to join the countries that support the Copenhagen Agreement, by which our country has joined a large number of UN member states which consider this agreement as a necessary step in relation to Kyoto, until the achievement of the final, legally binding agreement.
Bearing this in mind, it is my opinion that neither economic nor political interests should stand in the way of achieving a global consensus, as the beginning of the global/common struggle to preserve the natural balance of the planet. It is often forgotten that climate changes directly affect the development, poverty, hunger, and consequently the global peace and security. I am convinced that our common interest is to ensure that future generations inherit the best possible conditions on our common home, planet Earth.
Mr. President,
I hope that all of us who are here today agree that a comprehensive United Nations reform system is necessary, which must be carried out with extreme care and ensure the widest possible consensus of the member states.
Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the role of the United Nations and its agencies as a central for resolving key issues of international significance. Therefore, it supports the efforts and proposals for reforms that come from the UN Secretary General.
Through the United Nations reform, it is necessary to ensure efficient and coordinated functioning of all system agencies and bodies, bearing in mind to avoid duplication of activities in a more rational allocation of financial resources.
Regardless of the future configuration of the Security Council, we believe that the East European group of countries must have another non-permanent member, taking into account the fact that over the past two decades the number of countries in this group has more than doubled.
While presiding over the subsidiary body of the UN Security Council - an informal working group for the documentation and other procedural matters - Bosnia and Herzegovina has set the consideration of working methods and transparency of the Security Council, as one of the primary goals. BiH has also organized several informal meetings in cooperation with the partner countries and the UN General Assembly bodies, where the UN members expressed their opinions and visions and concrete proposals for improving the efficiency of the UN Security Council.
Mr. President,
I want particularly to emphasize that it is expected from the UN, particularly Security Council to be more active in preventive diplomacy. In order to make the work of this body much more efficient, we believe that the greater activity in this direction would provide a starting point to resolving many problems and crises in the world, before they flare up. Providing timely and effective action in conflict prevention, rather than reacting once the crisis has escalated, is certainly more efficient and less expensive instrument of action in preserving peace and security.
Mr. President,
During the six decades of its existence, the United Nations has passed through ordeals, but it always was and still is the best framework for seeking and giving adequate responses to a wide range of global issues we are facing.
Therefore, I urge you to work on the full implementation of all our agreements - in order to make the world a better place for our future generations.
Thank you."
40857,BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović's address on the occasion of the Day of Shaheed,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40857&langTag=en-US,2011-08-31,"Today, on the second day of Eid ul Fitr, we are marking the Day of Shaeeds. Entire Bosnia and Herzegovina is, as once our first President Alija Izetbegoviæ said, one huge cemetery of its best sons. They built their lives into the foundations of our freedom and democratic state in the times of glorious defence of our country from the aggression.
Dear Shaheed families’ members and members of the families of combatants
Dear friends and guests!
Today, on the second day of Eid ul Fitr, we are marking the Day of Shaeeds. Entire Bosnia and Herzegovina is, as once our first President Alija Izetbegoviæ said, one huge cemetery of its best sons.
They built their lives into the foundations of our freedom and democratic state in the times of glorious defence of our country from the aggression.
This is an opportunity to remember them, with sorrow, but with a particular pride and gratitude. With sorrow - because today they are not with their loved ones and those closest to them. With pride and gratitude - because had it not been for their sacrifice, new generations would not have been free and equal in their country of Bosnia, nor anywhere else in this world.
The ideals for which Bosnian sons fought and died have not been reached yet. But, our country has prevailed and is moving forward towards the community of free and democratic states.
Perhaps, we are not advancing at the pace which the most of us wish, yet we are advancing towards the goal. On that long path, the more difficult and the most painful part of the road is behind us. However, plenty of hard work is before us. That is why there is no room for despondency, passivity, indifference and selfishness.
There are still many of those who openly show their hostility towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, those who vainly dream of division of the country and threaten with secession.
It is not easy to listen and stand their insults and hate inciting. Yet, we will not be trapped to be side-guided by the offenders from the path of the truth, democracy, tolerance and civilisation values on which we are raising our country. For that is what they want – barren fuss, fights and new disputes in order for us to stay in one place instead of building our country and making it better and more prosperous.
Our future is, thanks God, clear and certain. And to the offenders and bad people we are sending the message from this place to think about the experience of their predecessors and let them draw clear conclusions for themselves from their destiny. It must be forever clear to all of them that - not a single inch of our in blood soaked country shall ever be anywhere else but within the boundaries of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These are the times of integrations, rebuilding of the bridges between the neighbours, the times of nearing the EU. But also, it is time for our integrations. I said this on 11 July 2011 in Srebrenica and I will repeat it here: we need a strong state, strong and united people. We must not divide; we must not be narrow-minded and short sighted. But, before all, we must never forget the best sons of this state, we must not betray the ideals and dreams of our Shaheeds.
In the times before us, we shall prove that their fight and sacrifice were not in vain. We shall build, with God’s help, free, peaceful and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina for all its peoples and citizens. For all the people of good intentions.
God bless all noble Bosnia-Herzegovinian Shaheeds.
May forever live the memory of the brave defenders of our Homeland."
40758,"Address by Bakir Izetbegović, BiH Presidency Member at the Potočari commemoration, 11 July 2011",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40758&langTag=en-US,2011-07-11,"We are here to remember our people whom we wanted to but could not help 16 years ago. We are here to be with them at least today, to look for words of compassion and understanding.
Dear mothers, dear family members of Srebrenica’s, Bratunac’, Zvornik’s, Milići’s, Vlasenica’s, Han Pijesak’s, Rogatica’s shahids!
Dear friends from our and other countries who arrived here to share our sorrow and memory of the genocide victims!
Brothers and sisters!
We have gathered here to pay tribute to mortal remains of yet another 613 men, boys and elderly men, who looked at these hills and woods for the last time sixteen years ago, while faced with the horror that is inconceivable to a normal human mind; faced with the evil ready to go all the way; faced with their own death, with the deaths of their brothers, sons, neighbours, with the extinction of innocent people with no-one having been spared; faced with genocide.
We are here to remember our people whom we wanted to but could not help 16 years ago. We are here to be with them at least today, to look for words of compassion and understanding.
No words can describe the horrors of Srebrenica, no words can help us understand what happened here, and why it happened. No words can explain the inexplicable, irrational evil. A limitless and voracious hatred aimed at those people whose only guilt was that they were Muslims and that they defended their country, places, houses in which they were born. No words can explain readiness to burn villages down, expel their residents to this little town, then kill and starve them for years, and finally, in the end, to kill each one of them.
This genocide was not a consequence of an uncontrolled emotion that lasted for a mere few hours, nor did it happen due to the guilt of a few commanders. The entire military and police structure, led by Ratko Mladić, carried out detaining, executing, and covering up of horrific crimes.
They did this persistently, all the way through, to the very last detainee; to the end.
Nesib Muhić, whom we will bury here today, was 11 at the time when he was killed, and Redžo Pudarić was 82. Nezira Ibišević, a girl who refused to abandon her father and brothers, was just 20. Srebrenica is the deepest wound in the body of the tormented Bosniak people. Other wounds may heal with time. This one never will.
Srebrenica is a dark stain on the international community’s cheek. That stain will never fade away. Srebrenica is a dark hole on the consciousness of those who ordered and committed crimes. They will never get rid of it, it will drag them into its dark whirl as long as they exist. They will live with it to the end of time. They will be held responsible before a grain of their remaining consciousness, before their own face in the mirror, they will be held responsible before human courts and, finally – before the God’s court.
They will be held responsible for deliberate, persistent, cynical evil by which they humiliated and shamed dignity of human kind.
Radovan Karadžić is at Scheveningen, and so is Ratko Mladić. Justice is slow and, unfortunately, just partial. Hundreds of direct perpetrators still remain at large. A large part of Serbian people has avoided facing the truth. In parts of Serbia and in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mladić has been celebrated as a hero. Some influential politicians state that credit is due to this criminal for creating some kind of Serbian state at this side of the Drina River. Those same politicians mention referendums that might question the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, separate Srebrenica from its territory. The international community yet again looks aside, demonstrates indecisiveness in condemning and sanctioning of a clearly anti-Dayton rhetoric and behaviour. There are still attempts to rewrite history, to relativise, to present all sides as equal. Attempts to find a grain in the eye of the defender, in order to equalize it with a beam in the eye of the aggressor. The returnees to Srebrenica and to other parts of RS still, with good reasons, feel like second rank citizens.
When we ask ourselves how we can proceed in this marathon race while dragging our legs cuffed with lead balls, how we can build our state and future with those who persist in salting our wounds by their words – we should bring to memory two messages.
The first one is the message from God and it says: “Give joy to the patient… there will be a relief after suffering”.
The second one are the words of late Alija Izetbegović, spoken on the occasion of the signing of the Dayton peace: “This is not a righteous peace, but it is more righteous than a continuation of the war. In the world as it is, in the situation as it is – no better peace could have been accomplished”.
The world of politics, unfortunately, has not changed significantly. It still finds it easier to follow the line of lesser resistance.
And therefore – in the world as it is today, in the situation as it is today, I hereby call on all Bosnian patriots to exercise additional patience. To share respect, unity and trust with one another. Let us not allow the feelings of powerlessness, hatred, or wish to revenge overwhelm us. The only revenge that is suitable for us, and to that I call on you to exercise, is to achieve victory against the war objectives of those who planned and committed the Srebrenica genocide.
That means to keep the sovereignty of our country, to ensure that forced migrants’ return, to locate and bury the victims. A dignified life of the living and a dignified peace of the dead. That means to insist on building a unified, well organized, prosperous state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Building of such country and society in which all fair and well-intended people see a clear future for them and for their children. In which only the wrong doers and bad people are worried about their future. No single criminal must live peacefully and remain unpunished. As long as they live, and as long as we live, we must continue to pursue them.
Let us continue to insist on strengthening our state and its institutions, improve living standards, and ensure sustainable return.
This is the time of integrations, of improvement of legal security of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the time of accession to the European Union and NATO. It is also the time for our own integrations. We need a strong state and a strong, united people. We should not divide ourselves on the issues related to the interest of our state and people, we should not be narrow-minded and short-sighted. Each municipality in the Federation can assist return and everyday life of returnees in one of the RS municipalities. There is no excuse for passivity, indifference, selfishness.
There is a long way ahead. However, we already left the harder and most painful portion of it behind our backs. The ongoing processes have evolved slowly, but in the right direction. Each year we make several important steps to stability of our country, and each year several key criminals end up behind the bars.
Relations in our region have stabilised, too, and finally there are leaders ready to face the past and build a better future.
President Ivo Josipović is with us today. I greet him and thank him for his commitment and persistent action that opens up a new perspective of relationships with the region. In a few days we are planning to attend a regional meeting of regional leaders in Croatia, where we envisage to achieve another improvement in the reconciliation processes, share support to one another in the EU accession, and discuss a joint approach to building of infrastructure.
A year ago, on today’s date, Boris Tadić was with us in Potočari, too, and he promised he would do everything he could to arrest Ratko Mladić. He kept his word.
The Srebrenica genocide brought NATO about to intervene in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The slaughter committed in the UN Safe Haven, followed by the Sarajevan Markale market place massacre added two last drops to the glass that had been filled in for years. The death of these men and women stopped the war and saved lives of many others, including, probably, the lives of some of us who gathered here today.
Let rahmat (God’s mercy, grace, compassion) be bestowed upon all shahids of Srebrenica and Central Podrinje region!
Let rahmat be bestowed upon all noble Bosnia and Herzegovinian shahids!
Let there live forever a memory of courageous defenders of our homeland!
In the following years, with God’s help, we will prove that their fight and their sacrifice were not to no avail.
We will complete the fight for a peaceful and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina, a land of good and well-intended people!
Thank you!"

Your co-operation opens space to every other form of co-operation and an accelerated linking of the threads and connections broken. For that I am glad to see so many faces from the entire region, known and respected in the world of business, and I hope that the events as this will encourage additional co-operation and friendship of yours.
Dear friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Guests!
It is a great pleasure of mine to address you here today on the occasion of election of the Best Manager of South East and Central Europe. I am truly happy to be here at the gathering dedicated to creative people who create additional values for all of us.
A high quality management of business organisations is extremely important for the community as a whole. In that way, among the rest, existence and affirmation for many people is secured, the society is enriched with better offer of products and services, and a constant transfer of knowledge and technology is ongoing. In the countries which are still in the transition process, as it is in our region, this is even more expressed since the system of a high quality business relations is yet to be established and which replaces the inherited way of thinking.
It is important to point out that efficient and effective business organisation represent one of the pillars of development of the concrete abilities of the entire nation and they must be supported. On the other hand, it matters that these organisations act as socially aware and to perform their role of corporative subject within the society in a dedicated and persistent manner. Everybody, in their own way, helps development of the community and I have no doubt that we are all aware of this.
Dear friends, you are the most direct participants in the creation of success and positive stories in our countries and I congratulate you on this. Your co-operation opens space to every other form of co-operation and an accelerated linking of the threads and connections broken. For that I am glad to see so many faces from the entire region, known and respected in the world of business, and I hope that the events as this will encourage additional co-operation and friendship of yours.
The capital, people and ideas must have space for circulation and may this gathering help the promotion of yours who are leaders in such understanding and representing of our overall relations.
I most sincerely congratulate you on your successes and I thank you for coming to our country and our city!
All the best and thank you!"
40727,Address of BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojša Radmanović at the Summit of the Heads of SEECP States,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40727&langTag=en-US,2011-06-30,"At the beginning, I wish before all to thank the organisers and sponsors of this important Summit, primarily to our host, President Vujanović, for a good and successful organisation of the Summit of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process States.
Dear Mr. Chairman,
Dear Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen
At the beginning, I wish before all to thank the organisers and sponsors of this important Summit, primarily to our host, President Vujanović, for a good and successful organisation of the Summit of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process States.
I am using this occasion to thank the representatives of Montenegro for a very successful one year presiding the SEECP during which several meetings and conferences were held at various levels and many of important results were made in the field of mutual cooperation of the states members. BiH expresses a particular gratitude to Montenegro for contributing the affirmation of the process during its mandate as “authentic voice of the region.”
This Summit of the SEECP is held in the midst of global economic and financial crisis which, for several years, has been influencing our countries as well as the countries of our surroundings and those of the European Union. The negative consequences of this crisis are heavily striking the economies of the states, due to which social and political stability of our societies is jeopardized.
For this reason, this is another opportunity to yet again send a message to all SEECP countries about the need for further strengthening of the regional cooperation, in the new forms of economic and trade links and relations in particular, as well as those in the field of security, communication, science and culture.
As it is known, BiH has from the very beginning been consistently committed to the regional cooperation as the only way to the solution of all questions among the countries of the South-East Europe, which it confirmed during its presiding over this initiative several years ago. BiH is endeavouring to adjust its actions in the field of the regional cooperation to the overall principles of BiH foreign policy within the international relations, before all the European commitments and widely accepted standards of the good-neighbourly relations.
All these years, we have been starting with the notion that the SEECP is the political strength of the region, capable of remaining open to cooperation and agreement of the countries in the situations when many of the global and regional circumstances are adverse. The South East Europe Cooperation Process has been and remains a political umbrella covering our mutual relations. The SEECP has confirmed to be a constructive forum for political dialogue about all open issues of the region. During the entire time of its existence and the work of the SEECP, solutions to many questions have been found to mutual cooperation of the member states, starting from the political dialogue at the highest level, parliamentary cooperation, to starting the solutions of the open questions that we do not agree on.
We do not hide that there still are many open questions among the countries, participants of this regional initiative, but also the readiness and will for these to be solved to mutual satisfaction and to the best interest of all involved. We have to be ready to use the capacity for dialogue of this forum, not just for good cooperation, but also the removal of the obstacles and the solution of all open questions in our joint work. It is the only way for us to answer to all the challenges that are there before our countries.
For the past years since it has existed, the Council for Regional Cooperation has constantly been workings on regional cooperation to which a particular contribution BiH has given, as a host country in which the headquarters of this Association is based.
Ladies and gentlemen,
BiH is firmly committed to the European integrations. It is an opportunity for us in BiH that we shall not miss, regardless of all the challenges, difficulties and disagreements which are following us on this path. This strategic commitment of ours is part of the overall progress of BiH, as well as our contribution to strengthening peace and sustainable development of this part of Europe.
At this place, I wish to convey the gratitude of the citizens and the authorities of BiH to the countries of the EU for the abolishment of the visa regime for all our citizens, which is a reward for successful reforms within the country, but also an encouragement for new progress. The visa-free regime has been functioning without any problems so that it has been bringing a multiple benefit to all its participants, our citizens, the country as a whole and the European Union.
Last year there were general elections in BiH. We have not succeeded in forming the government to this date, due to pronounced differences of the political actors on the models of national representation in legislative and executive government in BiH. The Dayton Constitution of BiH obliges for an equal participation of legitimate representatives of all constitutional peoples in BiH, which must mirror the calling of the executive government bodies at the state level. The Dayton Peace Accord remains to be the foundation of the existing and future relations of two entities and the three constitutive peoples in BiH
Regardless the deadlock in government forming at the state level, I must with pleasure say that with the participation of the EU, we have recently started the dialogue on the judiciary reform with an aim of implementing the European standards with regards to the rule of law, efficiency in reaching verdicts and the independence of the judiciary. The structural dialogue between the EU and Republika Srpska on the judiciary reforms, which had started as an internal political dispute, is a positive example of how a contentious internal question can be solved through the European political dialogue.
Compared to all the countries participants of the SEECP, BiH is still a limited democratic state, for having High Representative, without democratic electoral legitimacy and political responsibility. It is high time for BiH to be put on an equal par with the other states of the region and for it to take over the political responsibility for its future. We all talk about moving on to the phase of the European development of BiH, it is time to decisively move on to that phase, and on that path there is no room for High Representative.
Ladies and gentlemen,
At the end of this year we expect for all the countries of the Western Balkans to move on to the higher phase of the relations with the European Union. This is an opportunity to once again congratulate Croatia for finalising the negotiations and gaining the date of its accession to the EU. The Croatian accession to the EU brings the EU to the borders of BiH. It is a new challenge and an encouragement to all of us to triple the efforts on our European path.
Lastly, I wish to, once more, thank our hosts for a well organised Summit and wish more of the success to all in the future work of this important initiative. With a particular pleasure, I hail the decision of our hosts to open a special exhibition of the artists from the SEECP countries, as a contribution to the promotion of the dialogue among the cultures of the peoples of the South East Europe and the culture of peace in the region. This exhibition as well as the today's Summit of ours, shows that our artists, as well as our countries, have a lot to offer, not only to each other, but to the region and to entire Europe. It is for this reason that our joint voice should be louder. BiH is ready to give its contribution to it.
I thank you.

40724,"Address of the Chairman of BiH Presidency Nebojša Radmanović at the closing of the Summer University for Democracy, Strasbourg, 27th and 28th June 2011",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40724&langTag=en-US,2011-06-29,"It is my great pleasure to address you at the closing of the Summer University for Democracy of the Council of Europe. I am much obliged that I can share with you some thoughts on ethics and politics. Allow me, at the beginning, one slight remembrance. Next year will mark the tenth anniversary since BiH was accepted as a member of the Council of Europe. It was a large step for one small post-conflict country, which marked a new European beginning for our country.
Dear Secretary General,
Dear participants of the Summer University,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my great pleasure to address you at the closing of the Summer University for Democracy of the Council of Europe. I am much obliged that I can share with you some thoughts on ethics and politics.
Allow me, at the beginning, one slight remembrance. Next year will mark the tenth anniversary since BiH was accepted as a member of the Council of Europe. It was a large step for one small post-conflict country, which marked a new European beginning for our country. It was a sure step that in this temple of human rights and democracy, there is space for new young democracies. BiH gives a small contribution to strengthening of the traditions of the European democracy and development of human rights. Unfortunately, BiH is still under the protectorate of the International Community in which many decisions are still made by the High Representative of the International Community, who has not been elected by the citizens and peoples of BiH, which is incompatible with democracy and human rights defended and represented by the oldest European organisation – The Council of Europe.
I have been thinking of what could be a suitable beginning for our discussion today on the topic of “Ethics and Politics“. This topic occupies the greatest minds of our time, scientists, politicians, journalists, and many citizens. This is an appreciative but a risky topic. Seemingly, it is easy to basically say that we imagine an ideal relationship between ethics and politics. But it is difficult to steer through the woods of various specific policies and the assessment of its ethical dimensions.
I do not know of a better example than the one I will tell you, and which originates from the region of former Yugoslavia, which BiH belongs to. When the Nazis at the beginning of the Second World War in 1941 occupied the then Kingdom of Yugoslavia and established the quisling authority, they asked, under the pressure of all notable Serb intellectuals, to support the occupational regime. Among the invited was a Serb classical philosopher, interpreter, Hellenist and professor of the University of Belgrade, Miloš Ðurić, who declined to sign this appeal, putting himself in grave danger. When a composer and professor of the Music Academy who had signed the above appeal, quietly suggested that it would be better for him to sign it too, professor Ðurić told him: “It is easy for you, you play an instrument, and I teach students the ethics“. This is a unique statement in the European and world literature and one of those immortal thoughts which expresses basic truths about a man and his world. These words became the symbol of consistency in behaviour of one man in accordance with his ethical stance and personal convictions. Because of his convictions and active support for the Resistance Movement, professor Ðurić was sent for an early retirement, and then arrested and deported to a concentration camp.
In all times and among all peoples, there were people who, with their human and political action, have been examples of ethical and moral behaviour to the millions of other people in their fight for a better and more just society. These are today the sign posts and lighthouses in a spacious ocean of political life, which is at times dangerous and uncertain.
Politics and politicians are not especially highly regarded in our societies. A low level of trust in politics and politicians is a general trend in the world. In all surveys, we, the politicians are the least trusted but not much can be done without politics and politicians. In our transitional societies, there is a lot of displeasure with the work of the politicians and their regard towards the citizens who elected them to a public call which they had accepted. In BiH, there is a wide belief among the people in which politicians think one, speak another and do something different. Probably, this people's saying can be found in some other form within a majority of European peoples.
Not one ethics in the world can determine general rules of political action and behaviour that is applicable at all occasions and valid for all situations and all times. In any case, all of us who are in politics would have to know that there are means which are not allowed in politics, regardless of the aims. Politics in democracy must be oriented towards the spirit and virtue of its citizens, and less towards singular characteristics of certain politicians.
I believe that every policy derives from the values and goals which are desired to be accomplished, and not vice versa. Politics without ethics is power without a landmark and a compass. Ethics without power and means is ineffective and it ends in a principle. Pragmatism without ideals and ethical values is a bare programme of power. Politics separated from ethics is just a skill of ruling and winning authority, craft without ideas and goals. I believe that ethics and politics are intrinsically united, which enables us to differ good from bad political action.
The politicians from the Balkans are with reason often under criticism, because of the difference between their word and their action. However, our experience in BiH shows that the politicians who come from the West, when they come to BiH, behave under our circumstances, and not the way they would behave in their own countries. They soon forget the rules which exist in their democracies and immediately start behaving irresponsibly and comfortably as if we do not live in the same time and place. In this way, the international representatives in BiH deposed of hundreds of elected political representatives and forbade their work and every activity, without proof and right to appeal, they abolished laws and decisions of the parliamentary assemblies and imposed political solutions without any support within the electoral body and public.
The generations of current and future politicians will have a few challenges which they will have to face in the future:
In my opinion, idealism should be returned to politics as a belief in changes, commitment and dedication to the overall good, a spirit of debate and dialogue should be revived, vision and leadership on the principles of fair and responsible politics.
In a world of rapid changes and searching for the answers to new challenges, politics without clearly set obliging goals and values does not exist.
In future, courage will oppose the cheap populism which brings us the votes, and obstructing serious solution of societal problems.
Politics always refers to ideas. It will be a challenge in the future to find and define new ideas to replace the old ones and new problems of our societies and countries, as well as how to adjust those ideas and solutions to modern values and a view of the world of the civilization.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The School of Democracy organised by the Council of Europe represents a real small garden for future leaders of all generations. The other school awaits outside, in everyday political life. It is hard to give any advice for this. If one had to expose oneself to such a risk, then I would quote Nelson Mandela, one of those political leaders who became a role model to many generations due to his strong moral stance and sincere commitment to the overall good, who said “Believe in your dreams and keep your lives.“
Thank you."
40676,BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović Address on the occasion of the marking of the 20th Anniversary of the Patriotic League of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40676&langTag=en-US,2011-06-13,"At this very place, exactly 20 years ago, 356 of the most eminent Yugoslav Muslims, i.e. Bosniaks, gathered here in order to determine the position of our people and our country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the years of harsh historical development that was obviously going to happen. It certainly was one of the most important gatherings of our people in a thousand year long history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear President of the Association of the Patriotic League - Mr. Hebib,
Dear President of the Coordination Board of the Organisations of the Veterans – Mr. Kulosman,
Brothers and sisters,
Ladies and gentlemen,
As-salam-o-alaikum and Good Day to you!
At this very place, exactly 20 years ago, 356 of the most eminent Yugoslav Muslims, i.e. Bosniaks, gathered here in order to determine the position of our people and our country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the years of harsh historical development that was obviously going to happen. It certainly was one of the most important gatherings of our people in a thousand year long history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Very brave and long-sighted Decisions were brought; decisions that would determine the fundamental directions and guidance of the military and political fight of the Bosniaks in the decades ahead, including the time of today.
I will state only some of the positions of the Proclamation which was adopted on that historical day in Sarajevo:
- Bosnia and Herzegovina is the homeland to Muslims, Serbs and Croats, and all citizens who live in it. Its undividableness it granted to itself through Centuries of the live together.... For this reason, we call for all Muslims, all Serbs, and all Croats, and all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to defend their homeland.
- We opt for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a civil republic in which the freedoms and rights of a human and a citizen will be respected, national rights of peoples and minorities will be respected, and in which an economic and political democracy will rule. This is the long-lasting determination of the Muslim people.
- We call for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to decisively oppose every politics and actions which undermine and question equality and integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and equal rights of all of its peoples and citizens.
- Convinced in the lasting values of democracy and democratic institutions, we express our readiness to lead a dialogue on all questions of joint life in a democratic and civil Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- We believe in the need and future of integrations in Yugoslav and European region. This is the reason why the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina should permanently be opened towards Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro and beyond, across them towards Europe. For the openness of the borders towards all we have one condition only – friendly intentions.
The most concrete part of the Proclamation was the Paragraph 6, which states that, due to „the politics of national hegemony and great-statehood as well as the challenges which threaten the survival of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by that a direct survival of the Muslim people“, the Council for National Defence was founded, as a new body of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA).
The Council was soon to develop into the Patriotic League, and the Patriotic League would in an incredibly short period of time create conditions for strengthening the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a military force which the history of war and military warfare will certainly remember. For, the creation, strengthening and the military results of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, must be interesting to the analysts, since they simply resist the rational analysis. The fight of the BiH patriots surely deserves, at a first sight, pretentious title of – A miracle of Bosnian resistance! For, let us remember – in 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was an occupied country. The Yugoslav National Army units were withdrawn into it along with a massive military technique and over a 100,000 soldiers, i.e. the warriors who had tasted the fights in Croatia. Only in Sarajevo, there were 17 barracks, and the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) had created well equipped para-military formations across Bosnia and Herzegovina. We had practically moved from ground zero, from an occupied state to disarmed Territorial Defence.
Tuđman and Milošević had planned for Bosnia to fall silently (whispery). For it to be divided the way Cvetković and Maček did it, counting for no Muslims to be in it, and that we are only a passive object of division. They were gravely mistaken, they brought themselves, and us too, into one of the bloodiest wars on the Balkans. Tuđman let go of the aggression and great-state plan first, in 1993, and accepted the Washington Treaty. In 1994, the military balance was created despite the full encirclement and lack of communications and supply routes of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite the insidious weapons embargo which affected defenders only. Yet the Army, cut off from the rest of the world, strengths and starts to prevail! In 1995, our Army did not lose a single battle – it liberates towns, communications, mountains, and the glorious white banner with golden lilies waving on the freed summit of mountain Vlašić.
The victorious campaign was stopped in the autumn of 1995 under the threat of NATO strikes. The creators of the embargo did not want a military victor, they took away from us the military victory, yet the moral one, nobody can take from us, nor can anyone question it. The soldiers of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly members of the Bosniak people, who went through unprecedented horror, prosecution, concentration camps, genocide – those soldiers did not take revenge. They led a knightly and honourable flight, which, to our people and our country brought a good reputation and respect throughout the world. Both, amongst friendly peoples and those who are not.
Our fight is a founding stone for the future of generations to come. Yes, you see, there are philosophers who claim that the glorious resistance took place spontaneously, by itself. People, allegedly armed and formed resistance by themselves?! I am very sorry to, at this honourable place and on this honourable day, use this word to describe such claims – thus, deliberate, malicious lie and stupidity!
A soccer tournament for the elementary school pupils cannot be formed without any kind of organisation, not to speak about defending the country and people from a well coordinated aggression of immeasurably superior neighbours who were ready to commit the worst crimes! Some of our wise heads did not want to look the truth in the eye, but the Head of the Counter Intelligence Service, Aco Vasiljević, did and who objected to late Alija Izetbegović that SDA was arming the people, but he said: „... We are not concerned about it. The weapons themselves do not mean much. We are concerned that you are creating an organisation...“
Yes. The defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was organised by the Party of Democratic Action, more precisely, its democratic wing – the Patriotic League. The leaders of people, and later military leaders, starting from a commander of the General Quarters downwards, were the eminent members of the Patriotic League!
There are peoples who cherish the memories of their defeats, the battles lost, they cherish and remember them for hundreds of years, trying to make them their victories. With us, sometimes it is in reverse. Our people are good, brave, yet tending to forget. We forget our victories, the men who won those victories, prepared and made it possible. Meša Selimović says that we are the people who are not easily scared but that the Bosniaks are, after the historical efforts, prone to become, as he says, „sleepers“.
We mustn't ever again become sleepers! Awakening certainly shall be painful! If in 1991 we had to work illegally, hide and destroy our own traces, we mustn't do the same in 2011. We mustn't forget, we have to remember and record our own history, or someone else will do it for us. Mostly, not good-willed ones. In that history, the names of those who had a vision, courage and ability to organise resistance, should be engraved in gold letters. To stop the terrifying military machinery which was coming from all sides, to break its cogwheels and wheels.
May Allah rahmet and peace is upon all those who laid their lives in that unequal fight. We, who stayed alive, owe them and their associates.
We owe them gratitude, respect and memory.
They say that the war is continuance of politics by other means. In the post war Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was the other way around – those who do not love our country, and whom we were forced to share the first post war governments, viewed the politics as the war continued by other means. Bosnia and Herzegovina did not move from ground zero in 1996. It moved from the minus, from below zero. The burnt villages, destroyed cities, wounded nation, halted economy, yet the hardest and the most difficult problems were the constant obstructions that make our political fight a marathon race run with two lead balls attached to the legs.
Yet, we are fit people, strong. And wise too. Political goals which are set properly get a stronger or weaker, yet constant support from the International Community and our energy and creativity are overpowering those who are stalling the progress. In the past fifteen years out of three armies we have created one, out of three border services, we have created one, out of three Intelligence Agencies, we have created one. We have established over 60 institutions at the state level. The processes are moving slowly, but are moving in the right direction, in the direction that we have paved.
This is why I call for all the patriots for a new enthusiasm, new energy and faith. We need more self-confidence, mutual trust and respect. Agreement and patience. More of the solidarity. Annex VII which Mr. Avdo Hebib had already spoken about, if necessary, will be implemented by us alone. Federation must assist the return of Bosniaks and Croats to RS, here is the engine and the power of the state. An enormous job has been done. Longer, harder and steeper half of the way is behind us. We will prevail, with God's help. We will preserve the unity of the country and build a safe and prosperous society in which every honest man on every single inch of this beautiful country, will feel free and secure.
We will realise the visionary determination set in the Proclamation adopted here, 20 years ago.
The fight we will, with God's blessings, bring to an end by political means. Like in chess, this time, with white figures.
Those are our determinations and plans. Some others perhaps may have different plans, less peaceful. Those plans shall remain but a wish. For, the defenders are still in power, and twenty years is just enough for their sons to grow up. Made out of same material, with the same hearts and determinations.
President Hebib, president Kulosman, dear members of the Patriotic League, the patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I congratulate you your Jubilee – twenty years of courage and decisiveness, twenty years of the Patriotic League!"
40619,BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojša Radmanović's speech at the 17th Summit of the leaders of the countries of Central and South-eastern Europe on the subject of „Paths towards democracy: exchange of exper,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40619&langTag=en-US,2011-05-27,"Today's Summit is held in the circumstances of the global political, security and economic challenges to the stability of our societies and states.
Dear Mr. Chairman!
Dear Presidents!
Your Excellencies!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
At the beginning, I wish to thank the organisers and those under whose auspices this significant gathering is held, primarily to our host, President of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Bronislaw Komorowski, for a successful organisation of the Summit.
I am using this occasion to congratulate the representatives of Poland on the process of transition completed and for social transformations in the period to date, as well as on successful overcoming of the ongoing global and economic financial crisis.
Today's Summit is held in the circumstances of the global political, security and economic challenges to the stability of our societies and states. There are two major processes that we have been exposed to during last years and months: the one is the global and economic financial crisis that has been shaking markets of our states, brings in instability to the economic system leaving numerous negative consequences to our economic development, sustainability of employment, level of investments and possibility of social care of the population. Second is political turmoil and conflicts in the close European neighbourhood, in the Arabic world and in Africa.
Sixteen years after the war and the peace establishment in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has built institutions and has made significant improvement in the stabilisation of democracy. There have been six democratic elections in the country since then, which were marked with the highest grades by all relevant international factors. Even though it may look, to some external observers, that in BiH the elections give the same results and actors, after the elections in BiH, government has been changed in democratic and peaceful way in accordance with high electoral standards. Through determination to follow the European values, we have made huge steps towards peaceful. democratic, post-conflict society. Yet, BiH is still divided and unstable state.
On 15 September each year, on the International Day of Democracy, we can see that the world has stepped into a global democracy. Every day, more and more states are joining the society of democratic states. Democracy is the most commonly used word of our age. It has become a magical word of the epoch. There are many of those declaring themselves as democrats. Many of them call upon democracy even opponents and enemies of democracy do so. According to researches, so called indices of democracy conducted by various international non governmental agencies and analytic centres, BiH has been put in the category of ""hybrid democracy"", which means that country combines and practices democratic and non democratic forms of governing. Due to the Dayton Peace Agreement and the specific role of High Representative, BiH has been marked as ""international protectorate"" or ""controlled democracy"". In the post conflict period, BiH has passed new Laws and Institutions of the quality equal to one of the developed democratic states, as the Law on Freedom of Information, Electoral Law, Institution of Ombudsman and other codices and procedures are. BiH has never longer in its history been a democratic state in the modern sense of the word. The state has mainly been an integral part of various complex state rules without a long democratic transition. In addition to this, the state has never had a period of a long peaceful development that would strengthen its democratic potentials. Practically, the first time the country went on the path of democratic development, at its first general and free elections, at the beginning of the 1990s, it found itself in a bloody war and ethnic collapse.
The paradoxes of the BiH democracy are numerous and have constantly been multiplying instead of diminishing. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a European country at the beginning of the 21st Century, in which High Representative without democratic legitimacy has been imposing Laws arbitrarily, annuls Decisions of the legislative representatives of the people, dismissing elected political representatives of the people and arbitrates in the local political processes of the political subjects.
BiH is a non permanent member of the UN Security Council where it has been deciding on other world issues of the sovereign states, yet it alone is under the international protectorate that limits its sovereignty.
All citizens and political subjects in BiH have been devoted to going towards the EU membership. The EU is not an ideal political community, the EU itself has its own democratic deficits, but it is the best that united peoples and states have created with an aim of securing long lasting peace, economic improvement and social wellbeing. However, twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in many European circles, there is a wall towards the states of the Western Balkans. Let us not create a new ""Iron Curtain"" and new Balkan Wall. Europe needs to take responsibility for the integration of BiH and other countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union. With this aim, we have been encourages by last visits of the high officials of the European Union, Mr. Jose Manuel Barroso and Baroness Catherine Ashton, who created space for a stronger integration process of the country towards the EU. On the contrary, the Euro-scepticism could destroy political and social improvement made to date and leave us outside the world's ongoings.
Democracy is as important as development. The visionaries of the global democracy have been of the opinion that the values achieved experiences and knowledge can be inherited, gathered over the generations and passed over to the future generations. So can democracy too. We must not persist on this generation of politicians to take on the role of solving all our misunderstanding immediately and for all times. We must create a stable democratic space for future generations in BiH and in the region in accordance with our situation, possibilities and full responsibility to solve open issues of their time. As we are walking away from the war and move on the path of peace and development, towards the united Europe, our societies will be gaining confidence necessary and security towards predictable future. Bosnia and Herzegovina, on this democratic path of changes must move step by step, through the system of patient solution finding through internal dialogue, compromise and consensus, because only in this way it can win solutions for sustainable and long-term period. No solution that would be extorted and imposed externally, and which would not be democratically accepted will help BiH consolidate its democracy and political system. We should not expect miracles from democracy. Democracy itself cannot solve all the problems of a given society. It is a necessary, yet not a sufficient condition of existence of the progress of a society. Democracy can become its opposite in ethnically divided society and in unstable states, without institutional arrangements for conflict solution. It is very important for citizens to use the opportunities that democracy has to offer. We must bring back the spirit of dialogue, debates, discussions and critical observation of reality, into our society, in order to reach the best solutions.
We are living in the world in which we can stand up to the new security threats only through joint collective actions, for these challenges cannot be overcome by the efforts made by single states. Our joint determination is democratic agreement and decisive political actions against mutual threats and dangers to which democratic states in today's world are exposed to. Therefore, the needs of BiH within this region in the future still remain to be the fight against international terrorism, armament control, protection of human rights and minorities, fight against human trafficking and corruption and all other forms of crime.
Poverty is a huge opponent of democracy. The existence of the wide-spread poverty, especially the extreme poverty on a bigger scale is a threat to the social cohesion and political stability of the states of our region. Many social researchers consider that without reaching certain higher degree of development, no stable and sustainable democracy in our society is possible.
The true question of the future of BiH is: democracy or the protectorate? Our answer is democracy. Yet, the political happenings within and around BiH have not been convincing. Certain representatives of the international community have not learnt anything from the history of the international relations when the matter is of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans. Instead of breaking from the interventionalism of the great powers which in the past had been conducted by their predecessors, today, some representatives of the international communities are seeking for solutions for BiH outside its institutions, avoiding the legitimately elected representatives and democratic postulates of the society. Without democracy in BiH, there is no sincere dialogue within the state. Where there is no political dialogue, no solution exists. Where there is no solution, there is no progress of a country.
The countries of the Western Balkans are dreaming their European dream. The European Union should reach out to us and embrace us. Otherwise, we shall remain the astonished dream on the outskirts of Europe, exposed to devastating actions of various non-democratic political powers and processes which can bear negative consequences onto the whole of Europe and the World.
Thank you."
40492,Address of BiH Presidency Member Bakir Izetbegović over Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40492&langTag=en-US,2011-04-15,"On today's day, 19 years ago, following the Decree by the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all armed formations, in the entire territory of our homeland, were put under unified command of the Territorial Defence Staff. That decision followed immediately after the international recognition of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 April by the European Community and 7 April by the United States of America.
Dear veterans of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Dear soldiers, officers and generals,
Dear families of shaheeds and killed combatants
Dear citizens!
I CONGRATULATE YOU DAY OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
On today's day, 19 years ago, following the Decree by the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all armed formations, in the entire territory of our homeland, were put under unified command of the Territorial Defence Staff. That decision followed immediately after the international recognition of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 April by the European Community and 7 April by the United States of America. The Army was formed under conditions where there was a powerful military presence of the former Yugoslav National Army, helped by the paramilitary, demonstrating force, harassing and intimidating, and soon after killing, persecuting, looting and observing other kinds of criminal behaviour which caused enormous evil to the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is for the historical, military and political significance of such Presidential Decree, that 15 April 1992 was chosen as Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our generation, which took part in the establishment, development and military action of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina marks this date each year with pride and dignity.
We will do all necessary to keep this day in memory of the nation so that the future generations of the patriots of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue the tradition of marking such a significant date.
The emergence and development of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina was an act of responsibility, patriotic and political maturity of the then state leadership, members of the Presidency: Nijaz Duraković, Ivo Komšić, Mirko Pejanović, Ejup Ganić, Stjepan Kljujić and Tatjana Ljujić-Mijatović, headed by the President and Supreme Commander of the Presidency Alija Izetbegović. Their decisions, fateful for the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, responsibly followed political and patriotic determination of its citizens and peoples. It is this harmony of their historically significant decisions and patriotic aspirations that ensured unpresedented mobility, determination, persistence and readiness of the citizens to put in effort and sacrifice with an aim to defend Bosnia and Herzegovina as a social and state community of equal and free peoples of different ethnicity and religions.
The Army, together with the police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, boldly stood up to disproportionally stronger armed force of the agressor, under brutally unfavourable conditions of shamful arms embargo and strategic encirclement, with defence forces completely separated from the sources of supply for war, life and humanitarian needs. In that sense, the history of wars does not account for a case where a state had to defend itself under such complex conditions as Bosnia and Herzegovina faced. Additionally, there is no similar example in the history of war where the moral and patriotic connection of the people, army and state leadership was so strong as was in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995.
It is for this reason that we are so proud of our Army and behaviour of its members.
Lets remember that time and those people!
Lets keep our pride!
Lets keep our dignity!
We will achieve this only if we fulfill the moral and all other kinds of obligations towards the veteran population, the families of shaheeds, killed combatants, war veterans and civil war victims. And we will achieve this once we fulfill the goals for which we fought and died – when we build a state and society in which every respectable citizen of this country will see a clear and optimistic future for him/herself and his/her children.
As we can see, unfortunately, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is very complex. The blockade of the necessary reforms is causing enormous damage to all citizens and peoples. The threats to the territorial integrity, constitutional order and peace in this region have continued. All those who do this must know that we will defend our homeland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, by all means and at all cost!
We will defend it, first and foremost, with wisdom and benevolence. We have to, not only in words but in action, stand for intra-national trust, because co-habitation of people with different ethnicity and religion in this region does not have an alternative. I call on Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and all citizens to respect each other and offer neighbourly help, as such behaviour will be good for all of us. And those who are resisting the reforms I advise to stop undermining the prosperous future which the citizens of our homeland are offered with integration into the European Union and NATO.
It is a futile job. The times of disintegrations is forever behind us. People are facing harder living conditions each day. You cannot employ or feed them with irrelevant stories of vulnerability and calls for separations and conflicts. It will only deepen the crisis and further us from the solution, from a better life which each citizen of this country finally deserves.
Good tendencies, democracy, reconciliation and unification must override the tendency of stagnation and disintegration that is threatening to all. Let's be optimistic and turn towards the future. Let’s rationally interpret the interests of the peoples and citizens of this country. And let's start in the right direction.
Finally, once more, I congratulate the 15 April, Day of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to all patriots of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thank you.

Excellencies,
Honorable Guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a distinct pleasure to welcome you to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to this year's Sarajevo Business Forum.
We are proud to host this unique event that connects investors, businesses, and governments from all over the world around a common goal of creating public and private prosperity.
With over 14 billion Euros of investment projects in diverse sectors of the economy, the Sarajevo Business Forum offers many opportunities from which investors can profit, while – at the same time - creating jobs and economic growth.
This year, the Forum also aims to open a new chapter of mutually beneficial economic cooperation in our region. Improving relations with countries in the region is our top foreign policy priority, and one of the best ways to accomplish this goal is by intensifying economic cooperation.
And I am particularly pleased that this year’s Forum will feature the Education initiatives. These initiatives promise to lay the foundations for a knowledge-based economy that we need in order to keep pace with the accelerating changes in the global economy.
So, I would like to congratulate the management and the employees of the Bosna Bank International for organizing this event. They have worked very hard to put all the pieces together, and they have done a really great job.
It is no accident that the first Sarajevo Business Forum was enthusiastically received, and that it has become an annual event. Besides great potential for development and many investment opportunities it offers, Bosnia is also a natural gateway through which foreign investors and businesses can enter the Southeast European market.
Unfortunately, for many of those investors and businesses the stability and security of my country is often still overshadowed by the war which ended in 1995. Many of them perceive Bosnia as an unstable and risky place, even though we have been at peace for more than 15 years. And this misperception often acts as the main barrier for those who are interested in engaging us in trade and investments. It is my hope that this year's Sarajevo Business Forum will provide you with a more accurate picture of the situation in my country.
Fifteen years ago, Bosnia's starting position was below zero. In 1995, when the war ended, our country was devastated and our economy was at a standstill.
However, through 15 years of dedicated effort, Bosnia has gone a long way. In fact, we have traveled the more difficult half of the journey to becoming a fully prosperous country.
With the generous assistance of many of your governments, we were able to complete the reconstruction process relatively quickly considering the level of devastation.
We started with three ethnic-controlled armies, three border protection services, three tax agencies, three intelligence services.
And we unified all of them into single institutions at the state level. As a matter of fact, we created over 60 of those central government institutions.
We completed wide ranging political, social and economic reforms that have considerably improved the business climate in our country.
We started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005, and we signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union two years ago.
Last year, we were admitted to the NATO Membership Action Plan, and we became a member of the United Nations Security Council.
After a period of successful reconstruction, our GDP continued to grow strongly by about 6 percent annually. Our economy grew 0.9 percent in 2010, which clearly shows that we have overcome the effects of the global recession and are back in a positive zone. We now expect that our economy will grow 3 percent this year.
All of this proves that Bosnia and Herzegovina is irreversibly on the path to becoming a fully prosperous country.
Going forward, we need to focus on three broad priorities – three areas of building:
First, we have to continue to rebuild trust and restore relations among our ethnic groups. The reintegration of our society is a difficult task that can be accomplished only through dialogue and cooperation. And that is why it requires domestic leaders who have the courage to take these steps, and who are ready to listen and understand the other sides.
Second, we need to continue building accountable, effective, and functional institutions at all levels of government – in line with modern standards.
And, third, we have to rapidly build our physical infrastructure in order to enable a faster economic development. Investing in infrastructure is the best way to employ our construction industry – which, in turn, would stimulate many other sectors of our economy to grow. Modern infrastructure increases trade by easing the flow of goods and people. These rising trade activities will accelerate integration by fostering cooperation in Bosnia and in the whole region.
These three processes of building are key to ensuring lasting prosperity for Bosnia. They will reinforce one another and act in synergy to create a positive uplifting spiral of progress.
Unfortunately, the mistaken view that Bosnia is still riddled by instability has meant that foreign investors and businesses remain underrepresented here.
But, such lack of penetration means that those foreign investors and companies who enter our marketplace NOW have a unique opportunity to get in ""on the ground floor."" The profit they can make is high precisely because the perception of risk is still relatively high.
Bosnia also offers many other distinct benefits, such as:
Excellent geographic location, at the crossroads of the East and the West, the Mediteranian and Continental Europe.
Close proximity to major European business hubs.
Well educated, qualified, and young workforce with knowledge of English and other foreign languages.
We have huge resources that still lie unused and need to be developed, such as water, land, forests, wind, and minerals. Bosnia is especially rich in energy-generating resources and in unpolluted fertile soil that is ideal for organic agriculture.
Our companies have a long and rich tradition of engagement in international trade and business, especially in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Asia. Their considerable expertise and long-standing relations in those countries can be a valuable asset to those foreign companies who choose to partner with them.
The stability of our currency – which is pegged to the Euro - further contributes to a favorable business climate in our country.
A combination of our Central Bank's Currency Board and fiscal discipline has kept the inflation rate the lowest in the region.
The rights of foreign investors in Bosnia are equal to those of domestic investors, and are well protected under our Foreign Investment Law.
Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement with the neighbouring countries. Companies operating in Bosnia further benefit from the preferential trade regime with the European Union. This agreement allows for all goods that fulfill European Union standards to be exported to each of the 27 member states without quantitative restrictions, and free of customs or other duties.
Besides the European Union, Bosnia has preferential export regimes with countries such as Canada, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and the United States.
Over the past few years, we also carried out a number of business reforms which have made doing business in Bosnia easier:
We reduced the corporate income tax rate from 30 percent to 10 percent.
Profit distributions, including dividends, are now tax exempt, and tax losses can be carried forward for five years.
We simplified our labor tax processes, reduced employer contribution rates for social security, and abolished the payroll tax.
We implemented a comprehensive customs reform, creating a new customs law and establishing a new customs administration which has lowered the time needed for trade.
And we also reduced delays in property registration at the land registry offices. Our building permit system was improved by reducing the time to register a new building at the courts and land registry offices.
So, the good news is that Bosnia and Herzegovina is open and ready for business.
Our country offers great opportunities that can be unlocked through partnerships between public institutions and the private sector.
The future potential of these partnerships is limited only by the bounds of our creativity and goodwill.
With that in mind, I wish you all success, and I invite you to enjoy your time here.
Thank you very much.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear mayors of municipalities of Southeast Europe!
I wish you a warm welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sarajevo. I believe this country and this town will remain in good memory for its well known hospitality and warmth.
I congratulate you on the realization of the Fair of Municipalities and Towns of Southeast Europe! A fair such as this one is an excellent forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences which can positively affect the development of the environments you operate in.
We are all aware of the fact that it is the local authorities which are the first contact of the state and its citizens. It is the place from which everyday life of a citizen is directly affected on. Based on this experience, perception is formed on the overall quality of the state as a service.
All of our countries, at all government levels, must make every effort necessary to become more efficient and effective services to their citizens. I am convinced that this event will help this process and produce very concrete and useful results.
I am especially pleased that you are gathered here in such a remarkable number for this speaks of your interest in the perfection and greater engagement. I hope that the days of the fair you will spend in an open dialogue, finding the best possible solutions. After all, we all come from the region that faces the same or similar challenges of the transition and reaching of the European standards so we can help each other greatly.
Once again, I bid you a pleasant stay in our country and a successful fair!
All the best!"
40366,SPEECH BY BiH PRESIDENCY MEMBER BAKIR IZETBEGOVIĆ ON THE OCCASION OF THE INDEPENDENCE DAY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 1 MARCH 2011,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40366&langTag=en-US,2011-03-01,"To all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the bottom of my heart, I wish a Happy Independence Day! I wish you all well, peace, happiness and prosperity.
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear guests!
Nineteen years ago, today, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina came out to vote in a referendum on self-determination and by a majority vote decided that our beautiful country restores its independence. That day, for the reasons known to us all, citizens stated that the time had come to, after centuries of foreign governance, Bosnia and Herzegovina restores its sovereignty and historically based relevance.
Unfortunately, evil followed such decision. It was a brutal agression agaist our country, its peoples and citizens, against all that generations of Bosnians and Herzegovinians were jointly creating throughout history. Suffering which we went through, but also the resistance we gave in those first years of our restored independence, will forever stay engraved in memory of us here as well as in the memory of the rest of the world.
However, looking into the past has most sense if we are dedicated to a better future. Bosnia and Herzegovina has survived and, thanks God, it has been developing despite all obstacles. It is true that the speed with which the changes for the better are occuring is not satisfactory, but all of us who care for its future must patiently and dilligently continue to work, deliberate to reach agreement and believe in success. Nobody else will do it for us. This is not only our patriotic obligation but also a historical chance. Generations of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered, wishing for a free, stable and safe country, and we need to do all to accomplish this. Membership to NATO and the European Union will be the best confirmation that we have achieved this.
In this regard, I wish to invite everyone in this country, both those present today and those who are not, to liberate ourselves from the shackles of the Balkan spite and irrationality, from continuing and inhibiting distrust. Lets love our country, secure a better future for our children: together we can ensure peace, safety and stability, and build Bosnia and Herzegovina suitable for all.
To all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the bottom of my heart, I wish a Happy Independence Day! I wish you all well, peace, happiness and prosperity."
40344,"Address of BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojša Radmanović held at the Conference of „Parliament for Europe“, on the subject of: “European integrations as a priority goal of BiH foreign policy - suggestion",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40344&langTag=en-US,2011-02-24,"Foreign Policy of BiH is standing on two strong pillars. These are development of good-neighbourly relations and the EU membership. On this path we have climbed certain steps, as it is the membership to CEFTA, the most important form of regional economic and trade integration.
Mister President,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to greet You here on behalf of BiH Presidency.
Foreign Policy of BiH is standing on two strong pillars. These are development of good-neighbourly relations and the EU membership. On this path we have climbed certain steps, as it is the membership to CEFTA, the most important form of regional economic and trade integration. Also, BiH is very close to the World Trade Organisation membership as it is a part of strategic goals, by which it shows clear intentions of taking part in the world trade integrations. In the light of these foreign international processes, there is an internal basic political consensus in BiH.
At this moment, BiH has Potential Candidate Status when it comes to the EU membership. We have agreed relations with the EU through signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which has been respected so far. Unfortunately, BiH is the only country in the region which has not applied for the EU membership yet.
It is known that there is a part of the Agreement which BiH is not meeting, and which relates to creating legislative frame of the State Aid in BiH and to the establishment of the independent operational body to control the State Aid. I believe that an institutional frame for accomplishment of this important task from the Agreement with the EU will be made at soonest.
However, BiH has not yet adjusted its Constitution to European Convention on Human Rights, i.e. the Decision of the Court for Human Rights in the case of Sejdić-Finci. Given that there are concrete suggestions on how to solve this question; I am convinced that, as soon as the new legislative and executional government in BiH is formed, this question will be solved.
The last EU Report on the progress of BiH on the path of the European integrations for the year of 2010 states several levels of this progress in different fields: Significant progress, limited progress, little progress and certain delay. BiH is showing the trend of constant improvement, sometimes slower, but still improvement.
BiH will continue fulfilling obligations with regards to the SAA and adjusting all the fields and sector politics to the standards of the EU.
When it is about the delays, one of the reasons of these should be looked for in the electional campaign and the October elections which, like in any other country, took much of political energy on mutual rivalry of the political forces and internal political questions.
At this moment, non-existence of executive government in BiH after the elections held, takes away precious time which could be used for a significant step forward towards furthering the process of European integrations.
Today, we should ask this question: What should be politics of the EU towards BiH in such phase of our development?
Does the EU have a unified politics and clear strategic vision of what to do with BiH, except the enlargement position? What does formula „More of Europe, Less of the Dayton“of the EU engagement, which was announced by High Representative in BiH, mean? The EU should turn towards the reality, and let go of the metaphors without content, if the statement given by High Representative of the EU is in fact the position of the EU. Announcements by certain powers from the EU on stopping the enlargement process are producing nothing but Euro-skepticism.
The EU has announced that one of these days it is going to deliver a plan of the EU activities in BiH.
It would best for BiH to close the Office of High Representative and abolish the function of the EU representative, and appoint the Head of the EU Delegation in BiH. It is my personal position, and not of BiH Presidency.
The EU politics in BiH cannot be the politics of imposing of a single solution, but the politics of offering the institutional options and searching for the most functional solutions, which meet all European standards applicable.
In this phase of development in BiH, the EU should maintain approach of a negotiator with BiH, and not the arbitrary or dogmatic approach of imposing solutions.
Once, a long time ago, Jean Monnet, one of the architects of the EU, said, „If you have an insoluble problem, enlarge the context “. In other words, the question of BiH position today and its future must be seen in a larger context of the regional stability and European integrations. Only a stable, democratic and sustainable solution for BiH is its integration to the EU as a wider, economically more developed and politically more stable and safer structure. All of the problems in BiH will not be solved in this way, but it is the general frame and political context in which these problems will be solved that will change.
There is a consensus of the relevant political forces in BiH with regards the EU. It is perhaps the most important consensus after the Dayton Peace Agreement on which this country stands. This fact should be respected and used to the maximum, since in BiH there are obstructions of the progress on the path to the EU integrations by certain political centres and forces.
Exaggerated and impossible political demands which are set before the EU from one part of BiH show that those who do that in fact do not wish to join the EU, and so invent and set ultimate demands, and not patiently look for the solutions instead.
Such atmosphere is reflected by the EU and USA as dominant factors of the International politics towards BiH, striving to compel solutions which fit the interests of certain political groups only.
The question of constitutional reforms is increasingly spoken about in public, in frame of which, there is an introduction of the so called European clause, the magic wand which will solve all of our problems, both internal and those on the European path. It is again that the European path is dangerously mystified by various partial interests of certain political forces as well as questionable interests and goals.
Sluggishness of the enlargement of the Western Balkans leaves space for the Western Balkans to be influenced by other various great and regional centres of political power, of which interests, plans and goals we do not know anything about.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Based on all that has been said, I wish to remind ourselves of the words of the European idea visionary, „Depending on the circumstances, related to its creation, Europe will be more less complete. Will it ever be complete? Nobody can say. This is not a reason to delay the effort to reach the unity. Action is better than resignation, and the wish for perfection is a pathetic excuse not to do anything“.
I will conclude in two sentences. There will be as much of the EU in BiH as of our work on it, and not waiting for the solutions. The EU will be complete, if there is more action by the EU itself towards fulfilling its geographical regions.
Thank You."
40066,BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojša Radmanović's speech at the Summit of Heads of OSCE States in Kazakhstan 1st and 2nd December 2010,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=40066&langTag=en-US,2010-12-02,"It is a great pleasure to address the Summit at the highest level of OSCE states. It is the fact that 11 years have passed since the last Summit of OSCE at the highest level, which speaks of the importance of our gathering today. This means that we have come to the point that requires strategic vision and decisive collective action for the future of our organisation, the security of the region and the whole world.
Presidents,
Mr Chairman,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is a great pleasure to address the Summit at the highest level of OSCE states. It is the fact that 11 years have passed since the last Summit of OSCE at the highest level, which speaks of the importance of our gathering today. This means that we have come to the point that requires strategic vision and decisive collective action for the future of our organisation, the security of the region and the whole world. Allow me to inform you of the development of political situation in BiH and the progress made in the past period, to which BiH membership to OSCE contributes.
BiH represents a positive example of OSCE in the region, action of the international community in peace building, post-war transition and democratic reconstruction of safe environment and international trust in a multi-ethnic and complex country.
A month ago, BiH successfully organised and conducted its 6th elections since the war which OSCE mission and other international organisations marked with highest grades. The last elections are a sign of the readiness of the state and citizens to continue on the path of democratic progress towards a safe and stable political order and economically sustainable community.
This year has marked 15 years since the end of the war in BiH and signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Through general framework agreement for peace in BiH a special role was given to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe as one of the organisations involved in securing the lasting peace and post-conflict recovery of the country. Today, fifteen years later, we can say with pleasure that we have succeeded in accomplishing major aims and intentions of the Dayton Peace Agreement creators and fulfilled hopes and aspirations of peoples and citizens of BiH. Dayton Peace Agreement represents, in the newer world history, an example which has been successfully implemented and which gives hope for the future. Special contribution was given by OSCE in BiH in the field of democratisation, human rights protection, education and creation of safe environment and co-operation. This is an opportunity to thank OSCE for the contribution in post-war reconstruction and stabilisation of political circumstances in BiH.
Through joint effort of the international community and national authorities, BiH has implemented a majority of elements of Dayton Peace Agreement, launched and finished other reforms in different fields within the framework of social transformation and economical transition.
The ongoing reforms and changes represent fulfilment of accession criteria for lodging an application for becoming an EU candidate state, the closure of the Office of High Representative and its eventual transformation. Besides this, another political process has been started and parliamentary procedures have been launched to adjust BiH Constitution to European Convention of Human Rights and implementation of the Decision of the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg.
As a result of positive political developments and security conditions in BiH, both NATO and EUFOR have reduced their forces in BiH and redefined their engagement. BiH is the best example of values and effectiveness of the integral concept of OSCE at all three of its dimensions: political-military, economic and humanitarian.
Today, all countries of the Western Balkans are at the certain level of progress towards the European Union. At this moment, BiH is behind its neighbours, but with good chances to accelerate these processes.
All changes in BiH in the future must be based on the rule of law, further building of inter-ethnic trust and reconciliation that would reduce inter-ethnic tensions and secure lasting peace and sustainable economic development.
Ladies and gentlemen!
We live in the world in which new security threats can be confronted through mutual collective actions that cannot be overcome with the efforts of individual states alone. The goal of our countries and OSCE as a whole is prevention against mutual threats and dangers, as well as building of overall and lasting security for all. Priority of BiH needs within OSCE in the future remain to be fight against terrorism, weapon control, human rights and minority protection as well as fight against human trafficking, corruption and all forms of crime.
All efforts aiming to raise degree of efficiency and the work of the OSCE and strengthen its affirmation and promotion within the spectrum of international associations that contribute to peace, development and security in own regions and the world represent our strategic interest.
The OSCE, with its 56 member states, represents wide enough forums for expression and protection of direct interests of BiH, as its equal member, which on the basis of equality takes part in the dialogue on European security and co-operation.
In the framework of the OSCE, every country remains active, based on its own interest, which brings a number of advantages in political and diplomatic representation and enables solution of its own and mutual open questions with other countries.
For this reason, it is needed in the future to firmly keep already confirmed capacity of OSCE as an international organisation with a dominant form of co-operation at interstate level.
As a country that is located in a still unstable region of the Western Balkans, BiH recognises and supports OSCE as a forum and organisation with original mandate for an early prevention of all conflicts. BiH is ready to actively contribute towards early conflict prevention and neutralisation of situations that can cause conflicts in the OSCE region, as much for its own institutional form and readiness, as for the experience deriving from the times of tragic conflict in our country. Faced with the consequences of the tragic conflict in the region of former Yugoslavia, we consider it to be our obligation to actively participate in and support OSCE activities for early conflict prevention or solving situations that can lead to conflict at any phase.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I expect that this highest OSCE Summit opens new space for long-term co-operation of the member countries and brings new important decisions to enable such co-operation. BiH supports common initiatives of the member states aiming at building a high level of trust in Europe, strengthening of security, specifying new procedures in work and greater level of transparency of the work of the organisation.
Thank you."

“Respected Excellencies, colleague Izetbegović, Generals, Officers, NCOs, Soldiers, Dear guests…
It is a great pleasure to address you on behalf of BiH Presidency as Supreme Commander, and in my own name on the 5th Anniversary of BiH Armed Forces.
First of December, the Armed Forces Day, is the day of remembrance of those who invested a lot of knowledge, work, effort and expertise in the process of establishing BiH Armed Forces.
We are witnesses on daily basis how forming of united Armed Forces was a significant reform step and a move forward for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Advancement of reforms in the field of defence, where we have gone the furthest, is a strong and positive message to all in Bosnia and Herzegovina. If this could have happened in the field of defence and security, i.e. exactly where the most difficult progress was expected after the events of war, then we can be optimists with every right and hope for the improvement in other fields and segments of BiH society.
There is a wide consensus in Bosnia and Herzegovina related to NATO and EU membership. Sporadic negative positions related to BiH membership in Euro-Atlantic integrations, are mainly with the purpose of internal and daily-political party interests.
The process of establishing and the reform of BiH Armed Forces is an example of a successful reform in our society which gives us the right to be confident that this will continue, but we must not forget that this was a very complex process that required plenty of optimism, vision, decisiveness and patience.
After the approval of NATO MAP for our country, there is open sphere of additional reforms and obligations in reaching the NATO standards, which will bring us to full membership to NATO. I am sure that whatever is asked from us, we can and will complete.
I hope that very soon, at one of the future ceremonies on the occasion of BiH Armed Forces Day, I shall address you as the members of BiH Armed Forces that are full members of NATO.
I must point out and highlight that BiH Armed Forces, within the framework of its capabilities, give its contribution through engagement in allied activities of peace support and stability in the regions of crises around the world.
Because of all that we have done, today, on the Day of Armed Forces, I give credit to all members of BiH Armed Forces, who are active participants in the process of reforms. I am sure that BiH Ministry of Defence and BiH Armed Forces, on the basis of democratic principles of openness and co-operation will give its contribution and do everything necessary for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become equal member of democratic family of European countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, on behalf of BiH Presidency, and in my own name, I wish all members of BiH Armed Forces and their families all of the happiness and a lot of success in the future work and life.
Thank you”.

It is the Armed Forces that show and prove, how, through agreement and cooperation great things for this country and its citizens can be achieved.
Your Excellencies,
Generals, Officers, NCOs, soldiers,
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is a great pleasure to congratulate the BiH Armed Forces Day to the members of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina and citizens of our country.
It is the Armed Forces that show and prove, how, through agreement and cooperation great things for this country and its citizens can be achieved. Military, by nature, but also by its Constitutional position, is one of the key institutions guaranteeing peace and stability in every country. Because of this, today in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the experience of BiH Armed Forces, we may confirm that in this country, great capacity and readiness for mutual work to benefit of all citizens regardless of their national and political, or any other belonging can be made.
Only five years after establishing the BiH Armed Forces, through diligent work and devotion of its members, from generals to soldiers, this institution has become a reliable partner on the international level through engagement in peace-keeping operations in several regions of crises around the world. For such an engagement, never has any complaint been sent to the address of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Praises and high grades for the job our officers and soldiers have been doing, have been the only reactions in the period so far. Thanks to the hard work and readiness to achieve top results, Bosnia and Herzegovina is at a doorstep of membership to the most powerful military Association in the world; NATO. You may be sure that only the most prepared military organisations become members of this Association. NATO MAP approvement for our country is such a recognition.
However, in order to make another huge step towards NATO membership, Bosnia and Herzegovina must fulfill clearly set out condition, which is registering 69 military locations to be property of the state, i.e. Ministry of Defence of BiH. Responsibility to fulfill this condition lies on those creating political environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Armed Forces in BiH have completed their part. It is upon us, from BiH Presidency as the Supreme Commander, to all those in a decision-making process sharing the burden of responsibility, to enable fulfilling of this condition.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Let us use the positive example that we have with the BiH Armed Forces to launch all other processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the right direction. And that is membership in the European Union and NATO, i.e. secure and stable future for the generations to come.
Thank you."

To remember the event that marked the turn in history of BiH and which placed the foundations that BiH of today lies on. ZAVNOBiH is an event and a historical fact, importance of which we understand more and more as the time passes.
Councilors of ZAVNOBiH, Excellencies, Comrades, Ladies and gentlemen, Dear friends, Appreciated Invitees, Respected Citizens!
We are here tonight to remember and celebrate the event of 67 years ago. To remember the event that marked the turn in history of BiH and which placed the foundations that BiH of today lies on.
ZAVNOBiH is an event and a historical fact, importance of which we understand more and more as the time passes.
I shall remind you that during the meeting with the leaders of BiH People’s Liberation Movement, Rodoljub Čolaković and Avdo Humo, near Kladanj in July of 1943, Josip Broz Tito encouraged and initiated this first conference of ZAVNOBIH. His position then was, and so it was later on, that BiH should be an equal unit within the future state community which, to be honest, was not what many had wished then.
On that 25 November 1943, for the first time in history, representatives of all its peoples met for the first time and brought political decision that would suit their mutual interest.
They had enough strength, knowledge, wisdom to meet at the time of the highest culmination of, up to that time, the worst clashes and suffering, crime and unprecedented inter-ethnic hatred.
They showed then that the only overall national interests were the fight against fascism, fight for the equality of all of its peoples and citizens, and fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The importance of ZAVNOBiH is seen in the fact that, even today, every single sane human being would, without thinking, sign for these aims. Besides, let us not forget that, not so long ago, we fought in arms for the same aims.
Respected friends…
We, as a society, but also as individuals, must have the strength to face the truth of the past; we must have a wish and will to learn from the past. I think this gathering of ours today can serve to this cause.
We must not forget that after WWII, in the newly formed state community, all federal units had gained status on the basis of national criteria.
The only exception was BiH, which gained its federal status within Yugoslav community, on the basis of the fact that it had been a community of all its peoples that had lived in it for Centuries, but not on the basis of national criteria.
It may be a bit unusual, but it is true that today, in the age of computers, Internet, mobile phones, digital and cable TV, postulates of ZAVNOBiH sound current.
If we take a closer look, today, every single human being in this country needs for life and as a human being, all that was proclaimed 67 years ago, i.e. one of the ‘sacred rules’ of ZAVNOBiH, which is that every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is equal in his/her rights, way of life, regardless of which part of Bosnia and Herzegovina he or she lives in, regardless which people he or she belongs to, regardless whether he or she belongs to ‘majority or minority’, that every single piece of Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to its every citizen.
Today, the followers of defeated ideologies and individuals claim that the certain parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are exclusively Serb, Croat or Bosniak. They see it in the way they actually want to see it, exclusively tailored to their wishes, not taking into account others and the different ones.
Honestly speaking, these occurrences are more or less spread throughout BiH and it must stop and change in any possible way. It is our mutual disgrace, in a way, yet only through honest acceptation for the necessity to change this, we shall be able to change ourselves and be better.
Not the single people alone in Bosnia and Herzegovina has spare homeland. Not anybody has exclusive right to BiH, or any part of it.
I say this because it would be easier for all of us and simpler to accept or at least understand this.
Dear friends...
We do not have right to waste time and money of the citizens of this country any more through endless quasi-political demagogic discussions, the only aim of which is rising tensions and causing fear.
Our destiny and the primary aim is to become NATO member and the European Union state and there is no other way for us. How long it will take for us to achieve this depends on us alone. The sooner the better for all of us. NATO and the EU primarily mean new obligations, new way of thinking, new way of behaving, and we can do it.
We must all be clear with the fact that nobody, apart from ourselves alone, can arrange relations among us. For this we need honesty, trust and mutual respect.
There is an obligation upon this generation to pave the way for the future generations towards free, democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina of prosperity and NATO and the EU state.
With the wish to persist in building and strengthening our homeland, as a country of wellbeing and safety, and the overall good, I want, once again, to sincerely congratulate the Statehood Day to all of you.
Thank you and Cheers!"

Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
Thank you for answering the invitation to come and celebrate one of the most important dates in the history of our country. Sixty-seven years ago, in a small Bosnian and Herzegovinian town of Mrkonjić Grad, i.e. Varcar-Vakuf, historical and legal continuation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed. The foundations of the Statehood of this country were also confirmed. The idea of togetherness and equality of its all peoples and devotion to determined struggle against fascism, evil and violence were also confirmed. It was the time of WWII, the time of the hardest historical temptations that our country and its people went through.
Fifty-two years later, on the other side of the planet, in the American town of Dayton, in even more difficult historical circumstances for Bosnia and Herzegovina, political leaders of the time showed wisdom and courage and reached the agreement that stopped the war and physically confirmed the principles of ZAVNOBIH. The basis of the Dayton Agreement are state and legal continuation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, equality of its peoples and citizens, strong affirmation of human rights, and opposing to any form of discrimination. The price of peace was paid in the shape of entitiy line that was drawn, yet this Agreement had marked the way to reintegration and strengtheing of the state towards restoration of the multi-ethnic community.
History has, to any reasonable man, been the best teacher of life. In the past Century, it proved that Bosnia and Herzegovina as an idea and a historical and legal fact, is stronger than the power of destruction and desintegration. It has overlived powerful enemies. And every other attempt dividing this country brought only useless suffer to its citizens and yet to those who were trying to divide it.
This is why I call for all those wishing to divide this country and wishing for other misunderstandings and disintegrations to, as our people would say nicely, „okanu corava posla“ (steer from dirty business). Bosnia has only one way and it is the way of agreement and integrations. The European way.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is time for this country to move forward in huge steps towards stable and prosperous future under the patronship of Euro-Atlantic associations. This time asks for people who have learnt the lessons from the past and who recognise importance of decisions to be brought. There is an opportunity for us, as it was for those before us, to have political courage and wisdom to create environment of co-operation and agreement to open new better pages of history of this region. It is what we owe to those who laid their lives for this country, but also an obligation to ourselves and to those who will come after us.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina deserve better future.
It is upon all of us to, within the limits of our abilities but also responsibilities, give our contribution to stay remembered as a generation that understood challenges of the time it lived in and which left Bosnia and Herzegovina, safe and as the state of prosperity, a European Union and NATO state for the future generations.
With regards, let me once again congratulate the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to thank you for having glorified this occasion with your presence on this day."

ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDENCY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, NEBOJSA RADMANOVIC, AT THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) MEETING ON AFGHANISTAN
LISBON, 20 NOVEMBER 2010
NATO Secretary General,
Esteemed Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Four years ago Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed its readiness to take upon itself the obligations and rights implied by the membership in Euro-Atlantic family of free and democratic countries by joining the Partnership for Peace NATO Program.
Authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as its society as a whole, have taken a thorough and comprehensive approach to implementation of reforms in different fields with the goal of integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the Euro-Atlantic structures.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to contribute towards global peace and security. Armed and police forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina have in the past participated in the UN peacekeeping operations in Liberia, Sudan, East Timor, Cyprus, Haiti, Congo etc. An EOD unit of the BiH Armed Forces, consisting of 350 soldiers who were members of this unit during several rotations, successfully participated in peacekeeping operations in Iraq and returned to the country with positive experiences.
Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Agreement and the Financing Agreement with the NATO Secretary General on 11 March 2009. Presidency of BiH adopted on 27 July 2010 a Decision to send 45 members of AFBiH to the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, upheld by the House of Representatives at the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October this year first rotation replacement infantry unit was sent to the mission, engaging within the Danish contingent in Helmand province on providing security for immobile military facilities. A year earlier BiH sent 10 officers to the ISAF Mission NATO Command. BiH adopted a Decision to send 10 military police instructors and trainers to Afghanistan. Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina has also adopted a Decision to send 4 officers to ISAF headquarters. In 2010 BiH has donated 60 howitzers to the NATO Trust Fund for Development of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).
In its relations with NATO, Bosnia and Herzegovina has so far proved to be a responsible partner, ready to share the burden of security challenges of today.
BiH contribution to the ISAF Mission is substantial, considering that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small and economically weak country. It is important to emphasize that participation of BiH in the ISAF Mission is constantly growing, without causing any internal disputes. We will do everything to make Bosnia and Herzegovina a stable and reliable partner in the peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan.
Engagement of the AFBiH unit in ISAF Mission has so far been successful and this is supported by the assessments from the field. That speaks of good integration abilities of our officers and soldiers in new circumstances. ISAF military units also engage in significant civilian activities by providing assistance to the local population in their area of responsibility.
Providing training assistance to the Afghan Security Forces shall be the priority in the future.
Long term commitment of the international community in Afghanistan shall be directed towards the economic reconstruction and activation of natural and economic resources this country possesses in order for Afghanistan to take the path of peaceful transition and economic development.
Thank you."

Mr President,
Mr Secretary General,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to address the UN Security Council in the debate on BiH. Today's debate is a chance to familiarise better with the political situation in BiH and the progress that has been made in the past period. Since the last report, many new developments which changed the situation in BiH have taken place. There are many analyses and opinions among political subjects and citizens on the improvement made in BiH. BiH presidency has not had a united stance on this. Allow me to, as the Chairman of BiH presidency; deliver opinion agreed with the both of BiH Presidency Members, on the situation in BiH and possible directions of improvement in the future.
It has become popular today to speak about BiH using dark tones. It has been done so even from this platform. BiH is an ideal subject for different disaster seekers on which they wish to prove their theories. Unlike other similar regions in the world where the international community is engaged, BiH as a whole portrays a positive example of actions taken by the international community in the process of peace-building. It has been confirmed by numerous relevant reports from international organisations, independent institutions and nongovernmental organisations in the world. It is true that during the past six months BiH has had a slight deadlock on its path to reforms and transition. One of the reasons for this is the fact that this was the year of elections and political subjects were turned more towards electoral campaigns and winning votes, and not towards true issues of the country.
It is the fifteenth anniversary of Dayton Peace Agreement this year. Fifteen years ago BiH stepped out of a tragic conflict which destabilised the country and the whole region. Today, fifteen years later we ask ourselves: What have we done and how much from what we signed for and committed ourselves to, has been achieved?
Let me now say this: with the joint effort of the international community and local authorities, BiH has made significant progress in the post war period that represents a positive example in comparison to many other similar crises regions in the world. Name one peace agreement in the modern history of Europe and the world that was more successfully implemented? Some who are unhappy with the speed of progress in BiH are trying to find cure undermining the foundations of the existing peace agreement, which drags us into new conflicts and quarrels. Since the end of the war to date, Bosnia and Herzegovina has implemented all key elements of Dayton Peace Agreement: a stable peace has been established, the country functions on the constitutional basis of Dayton Peace Agreement, the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons has returned its properties and many have returned to the places they had lived in earlier. For this reason, BiH represents a successful example unlike other areas in the region. Six general parliament elections have been held out of which several have been organised by domestic authorities, unique economic space has been created, macro-economic indicators of the economy are stable and show slow but positive upward trend, value added tax has been successfully implemented, defence reform and armed forces reform has been successfully completed, after initial arrests of those accused for war crimes by international military forces majority of the latter ones were made by domestic authorities, domestic courts are holding war crime trials, BiH has become a member of the European Council and other international organisations, the country has entered NATO Partnership for Peace programme, we have become members of free trade zone CEFTA, and as a result of all this, Stabilisation and Association Agreement was signed with the EU. The country has met 174 conditions for visa regime to be abolished on what EU has already brought decision. Public Administration reforms are in the progress as well as those of legislature, high education and public broadcasting system, and adjustment of the Constitution to agree with the European Convention on Human Rights and verdict of European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg.
I am reminding you that, as a result of positive development of political and security circumstances in BiH, NATO has reduced its forces in BiH and their engagement was brought down to headquarters in Sarajevo only. Moreover, EURFOR, as a result of obvious progress on creation of safe and stable environment also reduced its forces in BiH.
There are different views on the position and status of the Office of High Representative in BiH. Political representatives from one people believe that the Office of High Representative should permanently remain in BiH. And representatives of others are of the opinion that it should be replaced by a Special Representative of the EU. Even if there were reasons after the war for the Office of High Representative to exist in BiH, fifteen years after that, they have been significantly reduced. In the last report on BiH by the European Commission it has been stated that BiH could not undertake further steps in the process of European integration until the transformation of the Office of High Representative is done to EU Special Representative Office.
All changes in BiH must be based on the rule of law. Therefore, full implementation of Dayton Peace Agreement is necessary. Dayton Agreement is firstly an agreement and not a framework from which one can take what one finds suitable and avoid accomplishment of other obligations. As far as the decision of the Office of High Representative according to which Annex 4 of Dayton Peace Agreement is changed, it is clear that legal acts can be changed only in the same way they were enacted unless those acts do not state differently. Therefore, discussions on these questions will continue.
An issue of building a functional state cannot be exclusively resolved with the changes in the constitutional and legal procedures for bringing decisions in BiH, through which higher unitarisation and decentralisation would be introduced. It is simplified and dangerous solution of complex and sensitive political issue. Such approach would question legitimacy of authority in a complex and multinational state such as BiH is, and ruffle the region which itself is not fully stable.
Basic pre-condition for building a functional state is reconciliation among the nations and mutual trust. Without punishing all executors of war crimes, from all peoples, there cannot be reconciliation and functional state cannot be built. The Hague Tribunal has estimated that BiH co-operates well so that all other estimates on this question are superfluous.
As far as the return of the refugees is concerned, there is a lack of understanding of these issues amongst domestic politicians and partly international community. In reality, there is no such case in the world where more has been done on the return of refugees and their property as it is the case in BiH. What is left is for sustainable return to be supported for which Bosnia and Herzegovina needs assistance from the international community. Double legal standards applied within a region 500 km wide in the Western Balkans, when return of refugees is concerned, is another issue that the international community should face, causing further injustice to refugees.
Today, all countries of the Western Balkans are at the certain level of progress towards accession to the EU. BiH is slightly behind its neighbours yet not as much as some with to portray.
These are all reasons to encourage BiH on its way to the EU where it belongs, for sooner transformation of the Office of High Representative, call for BiH political leaders to agree and organise the country based on their agreement without pressures from the outside. The essence of all reforms in BiH is an agreement, understanding, equality, tolerance and that should be encouraged and praised.
Thank you."

Mr Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Eminencies,
Ladies and gentleman
Elections are an important event in every country. They are chance and hope, an opportunity for a change, yet democratic consolidation of what has been achieved. Now that the elections are behind us we must turn to business in the future ahead. We must take political responsibility and fulfil promises given; it is so everywhere in the democratic world, so it should be in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Last elections in BiH confirmed political maturity of our citizens and their readiness to actively participate in the processes ahead of us. It is our task to make it possible for them. In this way, we shall strengthen our democratic capacity for the decisions that we should make. According to BiH Constitution, BiH Presidency is the highest authority in the country. BiH Presidency Members' conduct and understanding of this authority are based on this fact. This requires every Member to be responsible, visionary, principled but also ready for cooperation, compromise and agreement.
For the past four years, I have advocated dialog, cooperation, agreement and equality of entities and peoples as well as tolerant approach to solving of all open questions under the authority of BiH Presidency. It is the only politics that can be practised in every, but especially in a complex, multinational and conflict-ridden community such as BiH is.
BiH needs new landmarks and guideposts in the future.
Time which is before us will be decisive for the future of BiH and the region of the Western Balkans. As a member of BiH Presidency, I shall continue to contest for integration of BiH to the European Union and further development of good relations with the states of former Yugoslavia. I shall contest for the country to meet the necessary conditions for its candidate status on the path towards the European Union. Only with a candidate status, the accession process becomes irreversible for each country. This also means the closure of the Office of High Representative, and taking over the responsibility by domestic politicians for the future of the country.
I expect the European Union to be the guide and the landmark towards which we move but not to resolve our issues for us. Europe should have an advisory role and offer wider variety of solutions which meet the European standards, but not prescribe ready solutions to us and arbitrate our relations.
There have been errors made by a part of the international community in their dealing with BiH, which created a deeper mistrust between domestic political actors. The EU and the international community attitude on certain issues regarding recent reforms has been confusing. In several cases, bureaucratic parochialism and disorientation of certain individuals from the international community harmed democratic process of agreement within the country.
On political level, it is necessary to renew democratic dialogue and trust. For such to happen, the truth, punishment of all executors of war crimes, understanding and conciliation are necessary. It is very important to promote equality as a fundamental condition of life together. Moreover, we all should do all that is necessary to abolish a sense of individual and collective endangerment of any individual or a group of people in BiH. In BiH we all must show political patience. Nothing in BiH can be made ad hoc, by taking short-cuts or to a disadvantage of others. Even if this were possible, it would not be positive on a long term basis, because sooner or later it would emerge as a political mishit.
The new BiH Presidency Member mandate to me is an obligation, expression of trust, but also a serious challenge of responsibility. I do not underestimate issues that this country is facing and for this reason I approach to their solving with a full seriousness and responsibility. I have been doing so earlier; I shall continue to do the same in the new BiH Presidency.
Ladies and gentlemen,
At the end of our mandate it will be the year of 2014. It will also be a hundred year anniversary of the outbreak of the WWI, after which we have had different relations in the region of the Western Balkans. May this time the symbolism of round numbers be an encouragement to BiH Presidency and an invitation to the leaders of the Western Balkans to work together towards a long-lasting peace, turned towards the European Union and the future.
Thank you."

I am addressing you with a deep sense of honour, pride and responsibility for the high duty of Croat Member of BiH Presidency, which I have just taken for the second term. The conditions now are even more complex than they were during the previous period. Thus the tasks are more difficult and challenging than they were in the past four years.
I am sure that we all share conviction that BiH must be a democratic, developed European state, a state of the rule of law and tolerance, a state in which nobody will be discriminated against for religious, national or any other beliefs, a state in which all citizens will be equal in every single part of BiH territory. It is for this reason that I am using this occasion to take an obligation to persevere in the same principles and take stance for the same aims in the period ahead.
We are not here to portray the past nor the present, but to contest for a better future of this country, still I have to, very briefly, recall the last four years during which I performed this duty.
On the international level, the state of BiH has made certain accomplishments. We must hereby remind ourselves of BiH membership to the UN Security Council, accession to NATO Action Plan, entering EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and finally, recent abolishment of Schengen countries’ visa regime for BiH citizens.
However, we must be honest and say that only a few in this country were satisfied with the past four years. Since I belong to a generation of devastated youth, it could be argued that I am subjective, but to me, each day, month let alone a year is not to be wasted. I feel the majority of our citizens feel the same.
Honestly speaking, economic and financial crisis as well as poverty is more obvious each day and the quality of life of every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is being shattered.
Not a single citizen of BiH has deserved such hopelessness and lack of prosperity. It must not and it cannot be the future of our children!
It has to be changed, and that is what is expected by the citizens of this country. They expect this from us, those in whom they vested their trust and whom they voted for.
We are a very small country, there are not too many of us compared to European and especially global population.
This country does not deserve and cannot stand any further empty daily political phrases, false promises, i.e. immoral politics and lack of respect for fundamental ethical values as well as lack of care for an ordinary person and further divisions based on anything.
We surely possess knowledge and enthusiasm but we need a little bit more of goodwill, more mutual respect, more understanding, trust and appreciation for then our job will not be so difficult and our goal will be at an easy reach.
This goal is called Bosnia and Herzegovina in which it will be possible to live a life of a decent human being, Bosnia and Herzegovina that will be able to live off its own work and the results of its work, Bosnia and Herzegovina in which knowledge, expertise, qualifications will matter, rather than suitability, crime, corruption and ignorance.
Dear citizens!
I am addressing you and I am promising to persist in the same principles and take a stand for BiH to be a democratic state of all of its citizens, equal citizens and peoples. This has been and remains my highest objective.
I will continue fighting, guided by the same passion and responsibility for each and every one of you, whether it is about a Croat, or a Bosniak, Serb, Jew, Roma or any other citizen of BiH, because, to me, you are all mine, my Bosnian and Herzegovinians. I am not able to and do not wish to divide you.
Understandably, I will continue to stand for full equality of Croat people and their equal status under BiH Constitution.
I shall not spare effort in the next four years working for wellbeing and prosperity of our BiH, which we will make better and more successful, together. I would like to send a message to our neighbours that I will resiliently stand for normalisation of relations and co-operation, protecting the interests of BiH, its peoples and citizens, respecting the principles of equality, mutual appreciation, sovereignty, integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of others.
I expect our neighbours to finally respect the same principles for BiH and to build different, better relations on these foundations.
Our past is dark, hard, bloody, but let us not allow such past to obstruct the way to the future. This of course does not mean we should forget it. It is such as it is, and we should not falsify or misuse it. We should draw true historical and life lessons from it and in this way create an honest basis for rebuilding the solid bridges that will not crash under the challenges of this Century.
I would like to thank our friends in Europe, America and other parts of the world for the help given to BiH. Our country has a need for their further support because we need to complete stabilisation, build more efficient institutions and accelarate the BiH accession to NATO and EU.
We are aware of the fact that the majority of work is on us, on the legitimately elected representatives of citizens and constitutive peoples, on determination and will to rapidly build BiH as a democratic European state, capable of caring and building better future for all who live here.
When it is about foreign politics of our country, I will stand for decisions to be made in unison, to modernise foundations for conducting foreign policy and better regulate foreign affairs through laws. I will expect our diplomacy and foreign service to stand for the state interests alone, and not just certain segments of BiH. It should affirm our country in the world, as it has already been achieved with non-permanent status at the UN Security Council, participation in the peace-keeping missions in areas of crisis and establishment of diplomatic relations with a vast majority of the UN member states.
Moreover, it is a matter of priority to build our institutions and their capacity for negotiation process of our accession into NATO and the EU.
Lastly, I promise that during my mandate of BiH Presidency Member, I will never be led by interests of daily politics nor party interests!
This duty obliges me to stand for and follow the only interest that there is, and that is the interest of our homeland and country Bosnia and Herzegovina, with all its citizens and peoples.
Thank you."

Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Respected colleagues, members of BiH Presidency!
At the very beginning, I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the voters whose will decided for me to be chosen for this honorable position of BiH Presidency Member. A special thanks goes to unreserved support of my wife and daughter, friends and associates. In the years that follow, I will endevour to justify their support, effort and trust.
The building that we are in today recalls special memories, reminiscences and emotions. I first entered the building of BiH Presidency through the formal entrance exactly twenty years ago, in November 1990. And then, for years, I closely witnessed rapid float of history that took place and was created within these walls. Those were the growing pains of the state in its creation. Long hallways, wide Austrian stairways, old paintings and furniture, were all engraved in my memory together with the news and events that were occurring one after another. Naturally, the strongest reminiscence and emotion are linked to the cabinet that I am to enter today, succeeding the man that I assisted and followed for a whole decade. Our relationship to homeland and political philosophy he expressed in a few simple sentences that say “…this that we call Bosnia is not a piece of land in the Balkans. To many of us Bosnia is not only a homeland. Bosnia is an idea. It is a belief that people of different religions, nations and cultural traditions can live together…”
Yes, the idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina obviously goes beyond its geographical size and its borders. The worlds meet here. This is the knot where they tie or untie, not only Bosnian and Herzegovinian but global relations too.
It is time for a positive turn of events.
If we are to judge by the political rethorics and atmosphere, we could conclude that our country is again at one of the crossroads. However, this is not a crossroad, because crossroads offer different paths, and we only have one. The rest are misleads and blind streets. The only true path is the path of integration, union, co-operation, dialogue, in one word – European path.
The path of swift implementation of European standards in the state organisation, legislative institutions, economy and before all, in a sphere of human rights and freedoms. The path of removal and relativisation of borders, visas, obstacles and divisions. Naturally, this implies urgent adaption of constitutional reforms that will adjust our Constitution to European convention on human rights. Reforms to implement European clauses into our Constitution, build the state apparatus which can solve internal obstacles, and function without constant arbitrage and protectorate from the international community.
BiH Presidency must give a special contribution to above mentioned reforms and positive changes in the country and the region. Presidency should initiate and take special care of the most important processes in society. We are obliged to answer to our constitutional role and expectations of our citizens, serve as an example to other state institutions.
I wish to point out that I personally will, in the mandate ahead, do my best for this institution to function on the basis of mutual understanding and on the basis of recognisable will for co-operation through clear working programs and agreed platforms for diplomatic conduct outside the country.
I will especially stand for Presidency to lead the process of true and long term co-operation with neighbouring countries. All of us in the region are interested in improvement towards the membership to the European Union, and there is no improvement without true regional co-operation in solving open questions among bordering states. I will pay special attention to accession of our countries to NATO and the EU, for the membership in these associations brings safety, stability and prosperity to Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens. It is only a safe and stable country that can create a suitable business environment, attract foreign investments and capital, employ the youth, and thus raise the living standards of every citizen.
In this sense, I will offer strong support to decisive fight against violence, crime and corruption in our country. To prevail in the fight against modern age plaque is a precondition to a healing of the entire society.
I will strife for continuation of the process of sustainable return, with an accent on sustainability. Some think it is too late, but it is not so, not too late, the land is waiting for people to farm it, and 150,000 are waiting to return. I will therefore give strong support to the projects which support agriculture, employ returnees, especially the young and educated ones. We can secure the means via credit loans which have already been approved by the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the end of this speech, but not at the end of my priority list, is the interest for BiH diaspora. I feel to be a president and a representative of all the Bosniaks and Bosnians and Herzegovinians, as much as those in the country as those abroad. The diaspora has been on its own for too long, and one way co-operation through which diaspora supports the economy of our country sending billions of marks of direct financial infusion into our finances has also been lasting too long. It is time to systematically deal with diaspora, to organise it and help it. People who do not live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but still love and help it, wish that, and they deserve it.
Thank you for your attention!"

Allow me to express my gratitude to Dr. Ali Adussalam Treki for having ably presided over this body during the past year, and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected the new President of the General Assembly.

Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honor to address the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Allow me to express my gratitude to Dr. Ali Adussalam Treki for having ably presided over this body during the past year, and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected the new President of the General Assembly.
Fifteen years ago, the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the aggression and brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina. My country has gone a long way since, and I feel obliged to thank the governments, organizations, and individuals who assisted us in travelling this road.
When we asked you to support us to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council, you honored us with almost unanimous support. That demonstrated that you hold Bosnia and Herzegovina in esteem, and we are proud of that. As a member of the Security Council, we are doing our best to meet your expectations and honor the trust you gave us.
Thanks to the generous assistance of many of your governments, Bosnia and Herzegovina mainly completed the reconstruction process relatively quickly given the level of devastation. But the rebuilding of our devastated society proved to be much more difficult. From 1992 to 1995, an old, genuinely multicultural society of Bosnia and Herzegovina was brutally and intentionally torn apart by force. One-half of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina had to leave their homes in order to save their lives. One million three hundred thousand of them still remain outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Systematic obstructions were the cause of failure of return programs, and they are still an obstacle to those who want to return. Those who made it back to their homes are often confronted with a wall of blockades or with outright violations of basic rights. That makes the restoration of our pluralist society the single most difficult task ahead of us. But hope remains that the upcoming constitutional changes will lay a foundation for the new generation to bridge the divides. No matter what, we will continue to revive the pluralist character and tolerant spirit of our society because we strongly believe that cultural pluralism is the mankind’s most precious treasure.
Good economy can be a powerful tool to achieve this goal. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country rich in water and other energy-generating resources. We have made studies and have invited international investors to participate in developing these resources. Once completed, these projects will be the driving engine of our economy, enabling us to make progress in other areas, such as health care and social services. We continue to develop our infrastructure and agricultural resources, but not at a desirable pace. Although generally improved, our education system remains in some aspects hostage to divisive political influences.
On the other side, our rising trade activities have resulted in improving our relations with the countries in the region, and great opportunities can be unlocked through more intensive and more confident regional cooperation. Like in other societies, our greatest resource is our youth, educated in our country and abroad, ready to take over once our economy is able to absorb their skills and talents. I am confident that in the coming years a number of job opportunities will arise parallel with the development of the vast resources that lie still unused in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Defense reform is commonly seen as one of the greatest post-Dayton successes because it resulted in the unified, modern armed forces. Here again we have to express our appreciation to our friends and allies whose assistance made this possible. In short time our armed forces managed to earn the trust and respect of the United Nations through their participation in peacekeeping mission.
Like everywhere else, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina desire peace, stability and prosperity – a better future for themselves and their children. There is great potential for development, and opportunities are there to seize them. So, yes, there are reasons for optimism. But there are reasons for concern too.
Our progress is hindered by the remnants of those who still believe in the completion of the political project that proved catastrophic not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but for the whole region. In short, they think that the world has forgotten the atrocities committed against the civilian population, the concentration camps, the rape camps and the genocide. After hundreds of thousands of non-Serb civilians were killed and expelled from one part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they are now publically calling for the secession of that part. They hope and “dream,” as they say, that the world would somehow recognize that entity as an independent state. Instead of feeling shame, these disciples of Milošević, Karadžić and Ratko Mladić are now ready to come and ask you to reward the genocide in Srebrenica, Prijedor, Zvornik, Sarajevo, Mostar and other sites of horrific crimes for which Karadžić is now being tried at the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. What a monument to inhumanity would that be!
Of course, they will not succeed. They can no longer count on the mighty armies of Slobodan Milošević because those armies were defeated through our heroic struggle. They do count on, as they say, favourable geopolitical circumstances. But they fail to take one thing into account, as did Milošević: Bosnia and Herzegovina will be defended!
They will, however, continue obstructing progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they will continue destabilizing the region. They found inspiration in the inadequate response of the international community, whose patience they have been testing for the last fifteen years. So, our collective resolve to prevent the escalation and opening of fresh wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina is being tested again. We must not fail this time!
This dangerous adventurism aside, I believe and I know that the train of progress cannot and will not be stopped. There is no doubt in my mind that Bosnia and Herzegovina and our entire region will maintain stability and achieve prosperity in the coming years, thus fulfilling the dreams and desires of every one of our citizens."

Dr. Haris Silajdžić at the High Level Meeting on Sudan New York 24 September 2010,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=39890&langTag=en-US,2010-09-24,"I would like to thank the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for convening this meeting and reflecting the high priority that the United Nations has given to Sudan. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which is fundamental and indispensable for peace and stability in Sudan, reaches a critical stage. In less than four months, the referenda that will determine the future shape of the Sudan will take place.
Distinguished Heads of State,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to thank the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for convening this meeting and reflecting the high priority that the United Nations has given to Sudan.
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which is fundamental and indispensable for peace and stability in Sudan, reaches a critical stage. In less than four months, the referenda that will determine the future shape of the Sudan will take place.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports full implementation of the CPA. The level of cooperation between the Government of Sudan and the Government of the South Sudan in the pre- and post-referendum period will determine the destiny not only of Sudan, but of the entire region. It is of critical importance that the CPA parties engage constructively in order to address outstanding issues with regard to implementation of the CPA. We hope that the CPA parties, for the benefit of their peoples, will resolve all issues in a friendly and peaceful manner. Bearing in mind that conducting of the referenda will pose risk to the security situation, it is important that the CPA parties timely undertake all appropriate measures in order to be able to provide security to the civilian population.
Mr. Secretary-General,
It has to be underlined that any option must not leave any side disadvantaged. If unity prevails, a just power-sharing system has to be established. Moreover, diversity and equality of all regions have to be respected. On the other hand, if independence takes place, both sides have to be unified around values and principles of friendly relations and good cooperation. Regardless of the referenda outcome, it is important to give priority to the capacity building of the authorities of the South Sudan to provide security and deliver services to their population, because only viable South Sudan with strong local structures will contribute to peace and stability in the region.
Sudan is a good example of close cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. Symbiosis of a universal organization and a regional organization, and their collaboration in Darfur through their Hybrid Mission, UNAMID, have not only contributed to the improvement of situation on the ground, but gives hope and paves a way for peace as well. Experiences from this joint endeavor will help anticipate solutions for other conflicts and crises in Africa.
Mr. Secretary-General,
A just solution must be found for the people of Darfur. They have suffered for too long. The lasting solution for Darfur must include an equitable participation of the people of Darfur in the decision-making process and the creation of conditions to address their grievances.
Bosnia and Herzegovina fully supports political process and mediation efforts in Doha. It is essential that the Doha Peace Process goes within the timeline of the CPA. We call upon all parties to fully and unconditionally engage in this process. Allow me to express my gratitude to His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, for initiating and facilitating the Doha Peace Process. I would also like to thank all the governments and organizations that have contributed to moving this peace process forward.
Bosnia and Herzegovina also welcomes the improvement in the relations between Chad and Sudan. We must always keep in mind that the situation in Sudan and the peace and stability of the region are closely interconnected. Conducive environment in the region will facilitate positive development and help the people of Sudan solve their problems.
Mr. Secretary-General,
In conclusion, at this critical time Sudan deserves and must have the full attention of the international community. We all have to assist the peoples of Sudan to find their way to a better future for their country. As a country that has traveled the difficult road from suffering the worst atrocities and civilian plight in Europe since the Second World War to being a member of the United Nations Security Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready and willing to fully share its experiences to contribute to the international community’s efforts to bring lasting peace, stability and prosperity to Sudan.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General."

I would like to thank you, President GÜL, and the delegation of the Republic of Turkey for convening this high level meeting in order to make a strategic review of the Security Council’s growing role in the maintenance of international peace and security.
I would also like to thank the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his excellent presentation.
I sincerely hope that the outcome of our meeting today will serve as a useful tool for future Security Council deliberations.
The primary role of the Security Council under the United Nations Charter is to maintain international peace and security. We should live up to the expectations and send a unanimous message today that we commit ourselves to developing the means to fulfill this responsibility.
Mr. President,
Coming from the perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I cannot stress enough how crucial it is that the lessons learned in the past are applied accordingly. This Council has erred in the past, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most illustrative example of that in modern history.
By imposing and maintaining the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Security Council added to the overwhelming military advantage of Milosevic’s regime that intended to aggrandize its own territories at the expense of the surrounding states through genocide and ethnic cleansing regardless of human cost. As a result, according to the ICRC data, 200,000 people were killed, 12,000 of them children, up to 50,000 women were raped, and 2.2 million were forced to flee their homes. May I also remind you that one million three hundred fifty thousand citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina still leave outside of the country as a consequence.
Some powerful members of this Council justified this course at the time by arguing that the lifting of the embargo would add oil to the fire. The result was that the fire was essentially quelled with the blood of the innocent.
And, then, the horrors culminated in the genocide that was committed in Srebrenica in July 1995.
In fact, the UN Secretary-General’s Report on Srebrenica from 2000 unequivocally admitted:
“Through error, misjudgment and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder…..Srebrenica crystallized a truth understood only too late by the United Nations and the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a moral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever.”
Mr. President,
We cannot bring back the dead, but we can give dignity and justice to the survivors. What we say today is not aimed at the past, but at the future. We owe it not only to the victims and survivors, but to our common humanity. The message that this Security Council sends to the would-be perpetrators of crimes in the name of a twisted ideology must be clear: your crimes will not pay off.
The errors that were made in Bosnia and Herzegovina have to this day not been corrected. To the contrary, the peace and security established by the Dayton Agreement and the progress made in many fields are now destabilized by open calls for secession of one part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This destabilizing rhetoric was preceded by the testing of the international community’s patience for the last fifteen years.
Inadequate responses to the constant blocking of state institutions, return of refugees, and provocative rhetoric have been tolerated long enough for the perpetrators to believe that the time has come to turn the territories where atrocities, ethnic cleansing, and genocide were committed into their own fiefdom.
This is a threat not only to peace, security, and stability in which the international community invested so much, but also a test of the international community’s resolve to prevent the escalation and the opening of fresh wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It would be a repetition of mistake to dismiss open calls for changing international borders as election campaign rhetoric. Our ability to prevent is tested once more.
President John F. Kennedy once rightly said that “an error does not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.”
Mr. President,
I would also like to say a few sentences about the post-conflict peace-building operations.
Although all relevant national and international actors should be involved in the process, we consider the political will of the host country and the national ownership to be sine qua non conditions for the success of peace-building operations. The peace building process is primarily a national responsibility of post-conflict countries.
Promotion of dialogue between the parties to a conflict, particularly between decision-makers and civil society, is critical for national institutions’ capacity building and for confidence building and reconciliation process.
Holding accountable all those who committed crimes and bringing them to justice is of crucial importance to reconciliation process. Another unpleasant reminder is in order here: Ratko Mladiæ, the chief executioner of the genocide in Srebrenica, is still at large.
Peace building operations should be based on an integrated approach that includes establishment of good governance, rule of law, promotion of human rights, institution building, security sector reform, economic reconstruction and development, and full reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons.
The role of women and their involvement in peace-building efforts should be strengthened in post-conflict societies as well.
Mr. President,
In our increasingly interconnected world, the issues of peace and security are inseparable. New threats and challenges emerge by day. No country can isolate itself from them or tackle them individually. The Security Council, therefore, must be prepared to deal with challenges in a coherent, comprehensive and just way. The Security Council must meet the expectations and fulfill the hopes of millions of those in need throughout the world. They expect nothing less from us. We must not fail them.
Thank you, Mr. President!"
39874,Statement by His Excellency Dr. Haris Silajdzic at High Level Summit on Millenium Development Goals New York 22 September 2010,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=39874&langTag=en-US,2010-09-22,"It is an honor to participate in this High Level Meeting on Millennium Development Goals. Allow me to express my gratitude to Dr. Ali Adussalam Treki for having ably presided over the General Assembly during the past year, and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected the new President of the General Assembly.
Mister Chairmen,
Mister Secretary General,
Excellencies,
It is an honor to participate in this High Level Meeting on Millennium Development Goals.
Allow me to express my gratitude to Dr. Ali Adussalam Treki for having ably presided over the General Assembly during the past year, and to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected the new President of the General Assembly.
I would also like to thank the United Nations Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon for calling on world leaders to attend this summit in order to give a new momentum to the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals.
Mr. Chairmen,
Ten years ago, world governments agreed to ensure a new vision in order to change reality, creating a crucial platform for global 21st century cooperation. At that historic moment, by the adoption of the Millennium Declaration, key challenges that humanity faced were set, and concrete measures to assess progress in attaining interrelated goals and tasks, associated with development, governance, peace, security and human rights, were defined.
Today, this assembly presents an opportunity to answer two important questions: What is the progress status of pursuing commitments we had assumed at the Millennium Summit? And can we be satisfied with what we have achieved?
The results achieved so far are surely not to be underestimated, but they are still far from satisfying. Moreover, the results achieved are compromised by new challenges and problems we are facing: economic crises, conflicts, climate change effects, and other global challenges.
Mr. Chairmen,
Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully committed to the attainment of Millennium Development Goals. As a country that recently suffered major war devastation, and thereafter received significant international support for reconstruction, Bosnia and Herzegovina now invests significant efforts in order to achieve sustainability and its own responsibility.
Working to overcome current problems and create conditions for improving social circumstances, various activities are being implemented and planned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina has made its National Human Development Report on Millennium Development Goals, with the quantitative estimates of achieving Millennium Development Goals by 2015. We have also made the framework for defining the long-term strategic priorities, as well as the framework for harmonization of Millennium Development Goals with the social programs of the European Union. Our National Human Development Report focuses on Millennium Development Goals priorities of high importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially poverty reduction, development humanization, and development support enhancement.
In 2003, Bosnia and Herzegovina incorporated MDG indicators into its first Medium-Term Development Strategy 2004-2007. The achievement of MDGs in Bosnia and Herzegovina thus became a vital part of the development strategy and its implementation. The final report on the implementation of the measures planned within the Action Plans indicates that the progress in the achievement of MDGs was made within that medium-term period.
In this regard, we have developed two strategic documents: the Bosnia and Herzegovina 2010-2013 Development Strategy and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Social Inclusion Strategy. These documents have now been finalized and are to be adopted. The purpose of these strategies is to provide for a more stable, efficient and competitive economy, to reduce poverty and to achieve social inclusion in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as its integration into the European Union.
Both strategies have been drafted with a full participation of all levels of government and with participation of the civil society sector. Goals and priorities are corresponding to MDGs. The implementation of these strategies will be of great importance for our future progress towards achieving MDGs.
The Bosnia and Herzegovina 2010-2014 Employment Strategy is currently in the phase of public comments consideration. We have also adopted the 2008-2010 Decent Work Country Program document, which defines a set of policies targeted at mitigating problems in the field of employment.
With regard to solving social issues related to possible consequences of the energy sector reforms, Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Social Action Plan on the Memorandum of Understanding on Social Issues in the Context of the Energy Community[1]. The goal of this plan is to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable categories of our citizens in case of electric power price increase and to provide adequate measures for the protection and care of a possible surplus of employees in this sector.
In addition to the above, the document Disability Policy[2] created elementary conditions for creating solutions targeted at ensuring a higher level of social inclusion for this especially vulnerable group and enabling their access, among other things, to the labor market.
The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Decision on Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities[3], while the state Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees is working on establishing a Council for Persons with Disabilities.
The project Strengthening the System of Children’s Social Protection and Social Inclusion is currently being implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It aims to create a model of integrated child social protection through multi-sectoral cooperation. With the support of the Save Children UK, we are also currently implementing the project Standardization of Services in the Field of Children’s. These two projects will greatly contribute to harmonizing the regulations and improving the practice in the field of social and children protection.
Based on a series of international conventions and declarations as well as the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons Belonging to National Minority, adopted in 2003 at the state level and based on the document 2005-2015 Decade of Roma Inclusion, Bosnia and Herzegovina developed an Action Plan on Educational Needs of the Roma, who represent the biggest national minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to various reasons, the results are not satisfactory, and much still remains to be done, particularly in the areas of education and employment of Roma.
Mr. Chairmen,
Millennium Development Goals reflect the essence of all activities to which the United Nations are committed. It is, therefore, vital for Bosnia and Herzegovina to maintain the positive trend achieved in including these goals in our policies and strategies. We are fully determined to continue working with our partners in the international community in order to strengthen local self-responsibility and stimulate long-term development on the path to full membership in the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country rich in human and natural resources, especially in water, agricultural resources and renewable energy. We have not yet been able to fully realize our country’s potentials because our dysfunctional ethno-territorial arrangements hinder our efforts and prevent us from progressing at the desirable pace. In addition, we are witnessing an escalation of open calls for secession of one part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which have a destabilizing effect on the entire region. for In order to be able to fully utilize our potential, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to carry out constitutional reforms that will create a single economic space and make our government functional and rational, so that it can meet the needs of our citizens. The active support of the international community to Bosnia and Herzegovina in this reform process is of essence.
In conclusion, I would like to underline what we already know. In order to make real progress, it is necessary to improve the quality of support and coordination among donors, including financial and technical support, ensure full support by United Nations organisations as well as strengthen partnerships between the public and private sector and civil society. If this is done, I am hopeful that we can achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
Thank You!

39681,"Speech by BiH Presidency Member from the Republic of Srpska Nebojša Radmanović at the traditional folk assembly in Milića Gaj dedicated to the celebration of July 27, the Uprising Day of BiH Peoples",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=39681&langTag=en-US,2010-07-27,"It has been sixty-nine years since the historic decision to rebel against the Fascist and Nazi occupiers and domestic collaborators in then Yugoslavia, aligning the peoples of these territories, primarily the Serbian people, with the victorious antifascist coalition in the Second World War.
Dear Second World War soldiers,
Dear citizens of Knežpolje and Potkozarje,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to speak today, here in Milića Gaj, at the traditional folk assembly, dedicated to the celebration of July 27, the Uprising Day in 1941.
It has been sixty-nine years since the historic decision to rebel against the Fascist and Nazi occupiers and domestic collaborators in then Yugoslavia, aligning the peoples of these territories, primarily the Serbian people, with the victorious antifascist coalition in the Second World War.
This is an opportunity to remember the glorious battle of the Kozara, national heroes and others, known and unknown war heroes.
The Uprising decision was brave, visionary and deeply patriotic, one of the most important ones in the history of our peoples and nationalities. In then enslaved Europe, small nations raised arms against the occupier force, crime and terror. That is a great deed aligning us side by side with other freedom-loving peoples of Europe and the world.
The past of these areas has always been full of violent occupations by foreign troops conquering these territories, but also of freedom-loving and rebellious movements who would not put up with such a state. In general, the majority of cases involved a disproportional ratio of forces, even though small in number and military insufficiently prepared people in these areas were ready to sacrifice everything they had to defend thier land and freedom, sometimes paying a great price for their survival.
For that feat, in the Second World War, the merits go to the brave soldiers of the national liberation and antifascist movement, who had devotedly defended their country and the highest ideals of the humanity.
People in these areas have paid a great price for their freedom. Just remember the Calvary of the Serbian people in the Camp Jasenovac, their losses in the enemy offensive on the Kozara, as well as other trials and tribulations realistically described in Skender Kulenović’s poem «Stojanka majka Knežopoljka» and war songs and stories by Branko Čopić, from Grmeč to Kozara. Numbers tell us more than everything else does. Trough genocide against the Serbs and other war deaths during the Second World War, the municipality of Dubica had lost 54% of its pre-war population, which is a unique example of an ordeal in the world.
Therefore, we must never forget the contribution to the antifascist fight by the war partisan generation in the Second World War, thus joining the progressive forces of the entire humanity in the past century in the fight for every man’s freedom and freedom for all nations of the world.
I wish here today to pay respects and express my gratitude to all killed soldiers and innocent victims of Potkozarje and the entire Krajina from the Second World War and always to remember them proudly and with a necessary dignity. Additionally, I wish to express my deep gratitude to the fighters of the partisan movement for shown courage, patriotism, loyalty and devotion to permanent values that have kept us trough centuries, without which we could not last as people and as a society.
What that war partisan generation has achieved should be and must remain a permanent inspiration to the current and future generations of young people, as a testimonial of an adamant courage, self-sacrifice and patriotic loyalty to one’s country. I am convinced a lot can be changed in our lives, but the sense of indebtedness and appreciation to all those who sacrificed themselves for our freedom and humane ideals, will never fade away or disappear.
Although all this is known, today, in the public and political life of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other countries of former Yugoslavia, a «quiet revisionism» is slowly imposed, trying to equate the occupiers and the liberators, the criminals and the victims, the victors and the defeated.
So in BiH, books are written where facts are distorted about the partisan movement; monuments from those times are demolished; members of the infamous criminal formations who had committed mass crimes against the civilian population are openly glorified, some of them even have their streets, entire nations, Serbs among them, are denied participation and contribution to the national liberation fight and the real truth is left untold. All that is done by certain groups and individuals, for the daily political purposes in political fights against the political opponents.
Those who fought for a better and progressive world in the Second World War believed they were sacrificing themselves for a new world without wars and conflicts. Unfortunately, after forty years of peace, destiny played its part again in its tragic way and in early nineties, the peoples of former Yugoslavia became victims of statehood ambition of certain leaders and international imperial interests, when a strong and great state of Yugoslavia was broken, and its peoples were taken into quarrel and into a new war conflict. Between that war and the last patriotic war there is an unbreakable bond contained in the permanent resistance movement to defend what is ours and to be on our own.
Dear soldiers, dear friends,
Here, at this spot, we must say a few words about the current social and political moment in the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Regardless of the current difficulties, we must say that the Republic of Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the post-war period, achieved a high level of peace and progress, also confirmed by comparison with similar countries that went trough war and the post-war reconstruction.
We have a clear goal, no matter how far it may seem to us today - the European Union. We want to develop and look into the future, aware of all the difficulties and obstacles standing in our way. That is our voluntary choice and decision that in no way can be imposed on us. We want to live in peace with our neighbors and solve all open problems by agreement and in the general welfare of our citizens. All strategic issues of the Republic of Srpska’s future will be a result of the political will of the Republic of Srpska citizens and its legitimately elected representatives.
New elections are before us in the month of October. Once again, the citizens of the Republic of Srpska will be tested in political maturity and democratic election. It is up to them to decide who will represent them in the following election period. I believe that the citizens will elect those they believe would represent them best and best protect the interests of the Republic of Srpska within BiH.
In heavy circumstances of the world economic crisis and constant pressures on the Republic of Srpska, we must choose brave and decisive people who know how to strengthen the Republic of Srpska, who will be adamant in defending its Dayton position and competence, who will say NO to all pressures and all attempts to take away what is ours. For that, we need political unity and fraternal harmony.
In the end, I wish to send a message of peace from this spot to the current and future generations in BiH and all the neighbors. Let this war and suffering never happen again. Let all men and peoples live in peace, welfare and mutual tolerance, respecting each other, on their land.
Only that way, we will ensure the future for us and our children, together with other peoples of Europe, to enjoy the benefits of peace and development. Every other manner will destroy the future for all of us, and that is something we must not allow.
Thank you!

39633,Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić’s address on occasion of the 15th anniversary of genocide against the Bosniaks of the „UN Protected Zone“ Srebrenica and the burial of ide,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=39633&langTag=en-US,2010-07-11,"I have talked with many family members of the Srebrenica genocide victims, wondering what their message to convey to you today would be. Everyone, without exception, emphasized truth and justice, and no one mentioned revenge. After terrible losses and suffering caused by their malefactors, such a position towards it astonishes us with its civility and human kindness.
Dear families of the Srebrenica genocide victims,
Excellencies Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ministers, Ambassadors,
Participants of the Peace March and everyone present,
Dear friends,
I have talked with many family members of the Srebrenica genocide victims, wondering what their message to convey to you today would be. Everyone, without exception, emphasized truth and justice, and no one mentioned revenge. After terrible losses and suffering caused by their malefactors, such a position towards it astonishes us with its civility and human kindness. I remind you about the fact that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, even besides and after everything that has happened, not a single act of revenge has been registered. However, it does not mean that these people will allow to have their human dignity waded.
Slobodan Milošević’s regime had made such a mistake, therefore it was beaten, morally, military and politically. These people did nothing to earn death and ethnic cleansing, just as they do not deserve today to see the genocide results used as a key weapon for blocking the construction of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a democratic country of equal peoples and nations and that is why the solutions leading towards ending this inhumane project will be discarded as so far.
We all know the truth. Slobodan Milošević’s regime planned in detail and executed all this evil, in aim of elimination or banishment of non-Serbs from the large part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina territory. The civilians were at the attack of an organized and powerful military force. The fact that the UN Security Council had kept the embargo on weapon import helped the aggressors, thus tying the hands and depriving those who had to fight of their right to fight. The question is how it is possible that international community has done such a thing.
The answer is simple: because the victims were Bosniaks, Muslims. „Embargo (on weapon import) was kept because it was to the detriment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, “says former US President Clinton in his book that was published after our last year’s gathering at this very spot. Explaining why his efforts to lift the embargo and allow the attacked people to defend their bare existence failed, President Clinton cites the arguments given to him by certain European leaders, making these horrible crimes acceptable. „That is a painful and realistic reconstruction of a Christian Europe“was one of the arguments privately offered to President Clinton.
It is clear that the Christianity, as a religion, has nothing to do with savagery against the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the contrary. I remind you that today, we also send off our catholic fellow citizen with due piety, participating, as much as possible, in the pain of his closest ones. Therefore, one cannot be surprised that the US President Obama called the crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina „stain on the humanity’s conscience“. Only truth and justice, arresting Mladiæ and others and not understating the genocide results could appease humanity’s conscience. Obstacles in that path can no longer be tolerated and considered relative. We have 775 reasons for it before us and for this year only. Thousands await a dignified send-off worthy of a man.
The international community admitted making a fatal mistake against the Srebrenica genocide victims trough recognition of the United Nations and trough declarations of certain democratic countries made individually: US Congress condemned the genocide, ethnic cleansing and aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Parliament declared July 11 the Day of remembering the Srebrenica genocide, and the Serbian Assembly condemned this crime and offered their apology to the victims’ families. So, nowhere in the world, except in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is this genocide denied.
Law proposal on Holocaust and genocide denial prohibition was blocked in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly by those who deny genocide at the first place. It is clear that the current deniers of genocide will end as waste of the history of the world and of the Serbian people, just like Slobodan Milošević and Radovan Karadžić end up. However, it is tragic and confusing that some in the international community treat the deniers of horrible crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina just as they had treated the perpetrators of those crimes. That must be changed, because, otherwise, all statements involving Srebrenica would seem empty. We expect the European Union to send a clear demand to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliamentary Assembly, i.e. adopting the proposed Law on Holocaust and genocide denial prohibition.
Proving genocide in the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a completed process. Radovan Karadžić’s trial is currently underway, who, according to his charges, had the genocidal intention to destroy BiH Muslims since October 1991. Srebrenica is a symbol of genocide against the Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but we do not forget the crimes committed by the Serbian forces wide across Bosnia and Herzegovina. A commemoration will be held in Omarska for the victims of the Serbian concentration camps from 1992. That event, like so many others, will not have such media coverage. That is why we, on the day of the Srebrenica genocide commemoration, also remember the victims from Prijedor, Ključ, Zvornik, Brčko, Sarajevo, Manjača, Foča, Bileća, Bijeljina and all those known and unknown who had fallen as victims of this fascistic project, regardless who they were."

Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen
It is an honor for me to greet you all here tonight. At the outset I would like to express our deep gratitude for your support for the candidacy of Bosnia and Herzegovina for non-permanent seat in UN Security Council 2010-2011 at the elections that will be held in two days in UN General Assembly. Allow me to underline the fact that my country gained support as the sole candidate from Eastern Europe, and I would like to use this opportunity to thank these countries for their trust. Your presence here tonight confirms that Bosnia and Herzegovina has numerous friends throughout the world. Today, these friends are helping us build a better and more equitable world.
Dear friends,
We are here in the United Nations, in the institution which represents the central point of the international cooperation. Bosnia and Herzegovina takes pride in the fact that, along with other former Yugoslavia successor countries, it can be considered as one of the founders of the United Nations.
My country shares concern about consequences caused by climate change, it being a global threat, and this surely demands active participation of all UN member states to the benefit of present and future generations. Planet Earth must remain a synonym for life.
We applaud disarmament programs, we actively support fight against terrorism, advocate strengthening of all mechanisms aimed at helping countries vigorously affected by the global economic crisis, and particularly support UN assistance missions in countries that are facing refugee and humanitarian crises.
It was in the United Nations that Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multinational, multicultural and multiconfessional country has affirmed its independence and found ways out from the worst historical situation and found solutions to its problems. Through active participation in UN peace - keeping missions we will use our experience in post-war recuperation, reconciliation and reconstruction of trust with the aim of preventing and solving conflicts. Above all it is our commitment but also a responsibility, as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Dear friends,
Thank you for your attention, support.
I wish you a pleasant evening."
36039,"Speech given by H.E. Mr. Željko Komšić, chairman of the BiH Presidency at the presentation of the First semi-annual report „Monitoring of the European Integration Process of Bosnia and Herzegovina” Bi",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=36039&langTag=en-US,2009-07-22,"It is a great honor to address you here today at the presentation of the First semi-annual report on Monitoring of the European integration process of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is highly commendable that the civil society is monitoring the work of BiH institutions throughout the stabilization and association process, especially if the findings are based on arguments and if they are possible to discuss during such event which gathered people from all walks of life.
Dear Excellencies,
Esteemed representatives
Representatives of institutions and civil society in BiH
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honor to address you here today at the presentation of the First semi-annual report on Monitoring of the European integration process of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is highly commendable that the civil society is monitoring the work of BiH institutions throughout the stabilization and association process, especially if the findings are based on arguments and if they are possible to discuss during such event which gathered people from all walks of life.
It has been more than a year since the signing of Stabilization and Association Agreement and since the Interim Agreement entered into force. Following this major step forward Bosnia and Herzegovina confronted itself and its capacities in order to meet commitments it has assumed. However, not only the government of a country is integrated into the EU but rather the entire society. Therefore it is a positive fact that the non-governmental sector is ready to assume more active and constructive role.
I believe that there is no alternative to the European integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This country cannot remain outside this process if it wants to achieve social and economic development and better standard for its citizens. In order for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a member of the European Union, it has to align its laws, regulations and its operational procedure with EU standards. The responsibility for alignment of regulations and standards lies not only with BiH institutions, but entities, cantons, Brčko District and municipal government as well. Therefore, it is highly important that competent institutions start doing their job in order to meet obligations from Stabilization and Association Agreement and create European atmosphere in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, there are many obstacles. They are evident in the sphere of political relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Namely, the leading political parties do not share a common view on methods, speed and priorities that in the future would make Bosnia and Herzegovina a candidate for membership and eventually member of the European Union. Mainly it is the issue of competence of entities and Bosnia and Herzegovina in matters relating to implementation of reform. Representatives from Republika Srpska believe that existing competence ought to remain at the entity level, even though many of those areas require a unique system of implementation that seeks for better communication and coordination of competent institutions. Furthermore, there is the issue of qualification of our administration as well as constitutional framework which is extremely complex and does not promote cooperation. And it is exactly cooperation and implementation of principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in process of arranging a functional system that are highly important for all those who wish to become a part of the European Union.
Thus this country needs young and educated people who will stay here and build it to be better than it is now, and those young people must be provided with proper work places. To this end we need both foreign investments and assets from the EU Funds. For this purpose Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to start to invest into science and development of new technologies. Bosnia and Herzegovina must engage itself in the area of balanced economic development of neglected regions. However, in a time of economic crisis we cannot achieve that on our own. The sooner we start arranging a system in our society and adopting EU standards, the closer we will be to the EU membership. We must not perceive the process of European integration as something we do for foreigners but rather as something we do for ourselves and the future of our children.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina must not suffer the consequences arising from the inactivity of administration and political disputes which result in delayed adoption of laws. Because of this I urged competent institutions to accelerate process of adoption of necessary laws and formation of institutions in order for Bosnia and Herzegovina to meet conditions for liberalization of the visa regime. In my opinion our citizens should be able to travel freely to EU countries and feel like free citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Europe. Without free citizens there is no free or dynamic civil society which can be an influential partner to government institutions.
In the end I would like to thank the Foreign Policy Initiative and Sida who made it possible to discuss these issues, promote European values and openly talk about all problems we are facing on our common path. I believe that it will lead to better mutual understanding of all domestic and foreign actors involved in process of European integration."

Mr. Chairman,
Your Majesties,
Excellencies,
Heads of State and Government,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the very outset, allow me to congratulate our host, the Arab Republic of Egypt, on its assumption of the Chairmanship of the Non Aligned Movement (NAM) as well as on the excellent organization of this important event and the great hospitality extended to all of us.
This is the first time that Bosnia and Herzegovina, as an independent state, attends this Summit at its highest level. As part of the non aligned Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a country that was one of the co- founders of the Movement, we inherited the values of non-alignment, and we are proud of that. Although in recent history, Bosnia and Herzegovina was faced with the most daunting and fierce challenges, it has remained committed to the fundamental principles of the Non Aligned Movement, and has been actively implementing them in its political practices. My government decided to become a candidate for a non permanent member seat in the UN Security Council for the period 2010-2011 because we believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina as a symbol can significantly contribute to the efficient activities of the UN and reaffirmation of fundamental principles of the Non Aligned Movement. On behalf of my country I would like to take this opportunity to kindly ask for your support of our candidacy.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small country, but it has a multiethnic, multicultural and multiconfessional character and a rich historic heritage. Therefore, it can understand various socio-political, cultural, and historical contexts and actively contribute and participate in resolving global problems. As part of the Non Aligned Movement, we consider that it is necessary now, more than ever, to include all capacities of our states in order to solve all issues, in the context of crisis areas and preservation of global and regional peace and stability. We ought to be united in fight against terrorism, in finding more efficient solutions for mounting global economic and financial crisis, relieving effects of climate change, preventing arms races, preventing brutal violation of human rights, bridging the gap between the rich and the poor and other challenges of the XXI century.
My country supports efforts by the Non Aligned Movement and the international community to ensure prerequisites and fulfillment of sustainable and Millennium development goals. It contributes to the reform of UN Organization, advocating the compromise acceptable to most member countries, emphasizing that strengthening of relations between the Security Council and the UN General Assembly will make the United Nations work more efficiently A special emphasis is put on better representation, efficiency and greater transparency at the Security Council.
Mr. Chairman,
Today, more than ever, it is important to conserve the nucleus of the modern world: endless wealth of multiculturalism and understanding between civilizations. In my country it is believed that the Non Aligned Movement has a special place in the preservation of this world. Bosnia and Herzegovina has always been a country of such habitus and that is the reason why we have always belonged to this family of nations. At the same time, we are following the path towards Euro Atlantic integration as a part of the globalization process of the modern world, but also in order to realize the values we share with the members of the Non Aligned Movement.
I would like to express my strong belief that friendly Egypt, one of the founders of the Non Aligned Movement, a country that enjoys great credibility on the international scene and that has been safely and wisely leading the Non Aligned Movement, will, in close cooperation with all of us, strongly reaffirm and modernize policies of the Movement for which safety, peace, human rights and economic development have no alternative. It is those values that Bosnia and Herzegovina will fight for in its capacity as a future non permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Thank you Mr. President

Families of the genocide victims,
Citizens of Srebrenica,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today we are burying 534 genocide victims, 44 of whom are underage children. Fourteen years on, some of those children would have been underage today.
We can never feel the depth of the pain that their families feel, but it is ours to share. Today’s gathering proves that Srebrenica will never be forgotten.
The International Criminal Tribunal brought an unprecedented verdict, but it was not given the attention it deserved. Those who discussed the verdict were criticized for ’dwelling in the past’. Unfortunately, this is our present. Trial of Radovan Karadzic is yet to come. Karadzic was indicted for genocide in 10 other BiH municipalities besides Srebrenica. Unfortunately, this constitutes part of our future as well.
The United Nations admitted the grave injustice they committed in case of Srebrenica. The Report adopted by the UN General Assembly reads as follows:
'Through error, misjudgment, and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder… Srebrenica crystallized a truth understood only too late by the United Nations and the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a moral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever.”
Errors can be committed, but they must not be repeated. The injustice of such proportions can not be rectified by either neglecting the verdict by the International Court of Justice or by insisting on solutions which constantly accommodate the policy of maintaining the results of the genocide and ethnic cleansing. Such solutions will never be accepted.
U.S. President Obama also referred to the crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina as ‘a stain on conscience of mankind’. The stain will remain unless we all engage in concrete, vital measures and solutions leading in the direction opposite from ideas of masterminds of those crimes. Their idea was to create ethnically clean territories and they mostly succeeded in their intentions because the return guaranteed by Dayton has never actually been achieved.
We cannot rectify injustice by measures and solutions which do not guarantee the minimum of human rights agreed in Dayton. Failure to implement the key Dayton elements is confirmed by hundreds of thousands of our citizens scattered around the world by force.
We are all obliged to make effort in order for our citizens to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity equally, and that is impossible without the minimum of justice.
To our neighbours, notably Serbia, we send out the following message: we do want good neighbourly relations, but it will not be achieved fully until Serbia admits responsibility for the crimes committed by former Belgrade regime while Ratko Mladic is still at large and Serbia prosecutes our defenders.
Confession is not a sign of weakness; it is rather a sign of strength and maturity. Truth and justice are not enemies of peace; they are foundations of peace and stability.
In this respect, we are encouraged by the Resolution of the European Parliament declaring July 11 the Day of Remembrance of Srebrenica genocide. The Resolution represents the embodiment of true European values and therefore it is welcome.
Nonetheless, mere words are not enough. It is time we took concrete steps and started applying values and standards in order to put behind the outcomes of this and other crimes. I am convinced that true European values in this country will fall on fertile ground. A lot of good in Bosnia and Herzegovina was suppressed by the evil that we confronted.
The fact that Croatia and Montenegro adopted the same Resolution proves how positive such a decision by European Parliament actually is. It would be crucial if Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia also adopted it.
Such a gesture pays respect to the victims and also brings back the hope of the common European future."

Dear Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the beginning I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and auspices of this important event, primarily our host, President Tadic, for a well-organized summit of the heads of state of the Central and the South-East Europe.
Today's gathering is being held in the light of three great challenges standing before our countries: one of them being the global financial and economic crisis with serious consequences for our economic development, the second one being the global problem of safe supply in all kinds of energy, and the third one, the challenges of the new enlargement of the European Union to the South-East of Europe, along with all dilemmas accompanying the process.
In the last few years Bosnia and Herzegovina has had a strong economic growth. Real growth of gross domestic product average, in the period 2003-2008, was 6% per year. Real economic growth is the result of implemented reforms and favorable external environment. The implemented reforms contributed to improving the business climate which led to the significant foreign capital inflows, mainly in the form of direct foreign investment. Tax reform was carried out successfully with introduction of the VAT system, which helped the recovery and consolidation of the public finances.
The global economic crisis strongly affects the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Consequences of this crisis will lead to slower economic growth, loss of jobs and increase in the poverty rate. Relatively good results of exports growth, amounted to an average of about 20% in the last three years, were stopped in the last quarter of the last year and this year. The lower exports were caused mainly by the fall of prices and demand for key export products, aluminum, steel, wood, chemical and textile industry products. Reduced credit activity of commercial banks and decrease in the foreign direct investment inflow reduce the prospects for achieving the economic growth.
Bosnia and Herzegovina largely depends on foreign remittances being a relatively reliable source of external financing. It could be expected that the recession in the European Union and the United States, which the largest part of remittances come from, will reduce the capacity of the diaspora to make the transfer of funds to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Being aware of the possible consequences of the crisis, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the governments of the Entities the Republic of Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Central Bank have taken a series of measures directed towards maintaining the continuity of macroeconomic stability and supporting sustainable development as our medium term target.
As a support for maintaining the macroeconomic stability the agreement was reached with the International Monetary Fund to support our economic program through the Stand-by arrangements in the amount of 1.2 billion Euros for a three-year period of 2009-2012. The program aims to maintain continuity of the Currency Board arrangement, ensure fiscal sustainability and maintain the stability of the financial sector. Fiscal policy measures will be targeted to reduce expenditure from the approved budgets for 2009.
Small open economies like Bosnia and Herzegovina’s require greater involvement into the world market and finding the areas of their competitive advantages. Such an area is the energy sector. Our estimates are that the existing installed power of 4052 MW of hydro and thermal power plants could increase by more than three times, with the construction of new hydroelectric power plants, modernization of the existing ones and building new power plants. This is our great development chance, the implementation of which can ensure a long-term sustainable high growth rate, as well as the exports growth. We are the only country in the region that exports electricity. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes realization of the project ""South Stream"" for natural gas supply and other energy resources from Russia to the area of the South East and Western Europe. Therein our countries see their chance to build the necessary gas infrastructure and ensuring a safe natural gas supply for their own development needs. This is an opportunity to once again thank our host, President Tadic, for the assistance the Republic of Serbia has provided for the gas supply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the last gas crisis in Europe.
As it is known Bosnia and Herzegovina has, since the very beginning, been consistently determined for the regional cooperation as the only way of resolving all issues between the neighboring and geographically adjacent countries, which was confirmed in its attitude during the previous period. Bosnia and Herzegovina strives for harmonizing its activities in the field of regional cooperation with the general international, and primarily European, commitments and widely accepted standards.
The proof for this is the fact that Sarajevo is the headquarters of the Regional Cooperation Council which work Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly supports. In the previous year the Council did a lot for the regional cooperation of the countries and the special contribution was provided by Bosnia and Herzegovina as the host country of this regional initiative.
In the past years the regions of Central and South East Europe launched and solved many issues of mutual cooperation between the countries, ranging from the parliamentarian cooperation, political dialogue at the highest level, to the commencement of resolution of those still outstanding, unresolved questions.
We do not hide that there are a lot of open issues between our countries as well as the readiness and willingness to resolve them to the general satisfaction in the interest of all participating countries. That is the only way we can answer the challenges that stand before our countries.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is clearly determined for the European and Euro-Atlantic integration. This is the opportunity that Bosnia and Herzegovina will not miss, regardless of all the challenges, difficulties and disagreements on this way.
Last year Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. The procedure for the SAA ratification by the EU member states is in the procedure. We expect that this process will be completed during next year.
We are convinced that all the goals and conditions set before us by the Peace Implementation Council for Bosnia and Herzegovina, could be fulfilled this year, which would lead to transformation of the Office of the High Representative into the Special Representative of the European Union. Therefore, any skepticism regarding our eventual future, existing both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with the representatives of the international community, would be removed. That would be a clear sign that Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign democratic state, without the Office of the High Representative, would be an equal competitor with other countries from our region in the process of the Euro-Atlantic integration. In this way, Bosnia and Herzegovina would acquire the requirements for submitting an application for a candidate status and improve its chances towards the full-pledged membership in the EU.
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina hope that, upon fulfillment of the conditions from the ""Road Map"", in the second half of this year, there is liberalization of visa regime early next year, at the same time as in the other countries in our region.
There is no alternative to the enlargement of the European Union to the Western Balkans countries. Therefore, together we must knock stronger on the European door if we want to get inside. This is the way it will open for us, countries of the last not-integrated region in Europe. Otherwise, we would miss the opportunity that carries a number of challenges, as well as opportunities, to finally leave the past behind and step into the new European future together.
Thank you."

Nebojsa Radmanovic, Seventh Regional Forum on Cultural Corridors of South East Europe ""Management of Heritage Diversity and its",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=35320&langTag=en-US,2009-06-04,"At the beginning I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and auspices of this important forum, primarily our host, President Vujanovic, for a well-organized event and the opportunity to exchange our views on such important topics and the issues concerning the countries of our region.
Dear Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the beginning I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and auspices of this important forum, primarily our host, President Vujanovic, for a well-organized event and the opportunity to exchange our views on such important topics and the issues concerning the countries of our region.
I would also like to thank Mr. Koďchiro Matsuura, the Director-General of the UNESCO, and Mr. Terry Davis, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, for cordial assistance they have been providing all these years since the forums are held of the South East European countries devoted to establishing and building the cultural corridors between our states.
This gathering of the representatives from the countries of South East Europe is a continuation of our previous forums related to the topics of richness of the cultural heritage and possibilities of cooperation in this area, as well as of the initiated conversations in the course of the last year, which was declared the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
South East Europe is an area of different cultures, national traditions, but also the common values of civilization. In addition to geographic proximity, our peoples and states are linked by the interweaving of different national cultures and traditions that build a unique cultural mosaic of Europe. Over sixty cultural monuments and natural properties of South East Europe are inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, with more than a hundred sites on the national lists that are being prepared for a nomination, which speaks enough about the cultural diversity and richness of this region. In the past, on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there were mixtures of various ancient civilizations and cultures, which are still recognizable in the archaeological sites, written cultural resources, religious cultural monuments and the urban and historic values.
Historical researches confirmed that in the past there existed strong cultural relations of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the European peoples and their countries. Many European and the world travel writers that were traveling in the last century throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina directed the attention of the European and world public to its cultural and historical heritage and natural beauty. What we failed to do - attract the world to our cultural wealth - has been made by the passengers and passers-by through Bosnia and Herzegovina, among whom there were prominent figures, ranging from writers, archeologists, ethnologists to diplomats. On the other hand, many famous scientists, artists, writers and cultural creators from Bosnia and Herzegovina, have worked in other European countries. In the past, students from Bosnia and Herzegovina were educated on the prestigious European universities thus spreading knowledge about our cultural and historical values and natural attraction. Thus our cultural and historical monuments, religious buildings, bridges, fortresses, but also traditional folk customs passed from travel writings into the tourist maps of Europe.
Bosnia and Herzegovina with its unique and rare cultural and historical monuments, has given a significant contribution to the cultural civilization heritage of Europe. Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina has two properties on the UNESCO's World Heritage List, the Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar and the Mehmed Pasa Sokolovic Bridge in Visegrad. Ongoing are the activities regarding the nomination of the old city core of Jajce, and in the future, it is planned to nominate a few more cultural and historical monuments of the unique value. As an example of regional cooperation between the countries in the field of cultural heritage during this year it is expected the joint nomination of the medieval tombstones, by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro.
Cultural and historical heritage is not only an expression of our identity, but also a powerful stimulus of economic development and tourist offer of our countries. Today the culture, understood in its broadest sense, is an important content of the tourist offer of many developed countries. Experts believe that in the process of globalization the future of tourism will be in the cultural offer because the people like what is authentic, original and different. This is the reason why many countries today are investing significant resources in culture and cultural heritage thus strengthen their overall tourist capacity and competitiveness in the world market. South Eastern Europe with its rich cultural and historical heritage has been recognized as an important tourist destination, which is evident from the tourist visits to the countries of the region.
Cultural tourism as a specific form of tourism, which includes the visit motivated by the interest for cultural and historic heritage, still does not take place it deserves in the tourist offer of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reasons for this situation are in the war devastations of many cultural and historic buildings and sites, weak investments in their reconstruction, negative image of the entire region, and insufficient promotion of the wider regional and global scale.
In the general post-war reconstruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there was the restoration of damaged or destroyed buildings and cultural monuments. I would especially point out the Old Bridge in Mostar, to the reconstruction of which the UNESCO has given a great contribution, Mehmed Pasa Sokolovic Bridge in Visegrad, the Old City Core of Jajce, the Ferhad Pasa Mosque and the Kastel Fortress in Banja Luka, the Orthodox Monastery Zitomislic, the City Hall in Sarajevo, cultural and historical objects in Kraljeva Sutjeska, Pocitelj, Blagaj and numerous churches, mosques, monasteries, cathedrals and other cultural monuments of national and world importance.
I would also like to point out the three important archaeological sites from prehistoric, ancient and the Roman period in the place Donja Dolina near the town Gradiska, natural reserve Hutovo blato and Skelani.
I have to also mention the outstanding natural sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina, unique in the world. These are the wildlife reserve of Bardaca near the town of Srbac, which is enlisted on the World List of protected swamp areas, Perucica Forest, one of remaining primeval forests in Europe within the National Park Sutjeska, Blidinje Cultural Landscape and Vjetrenica Cave, the second cave in the world in terms of biodiversity.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In the era of globalization, cultural identity and cultural diversity have become the values of key importance for every individual, ethnic and cultural community. On this basis, there is an interest in introducing other unknown cultures and civilizations.
This year, Bosnia and Herzegovina was the host of the World Rafting Championship, which was held in Banja Luka and Foca, on the rivers Vrbas and Tara, the largest sports events since the Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo in 1984. On that occasion, apart from the athletes, thousands of tourists and other businessmen and journalists from around the world visited Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Next year, Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the host of the European Fly Fishing Championship, also a very important sport, cultural and tourist event.
Culture and tourism may be one of the ways for a common change of a negative image that the countries of the Western Balkans still have, because of the recent war history. It is easier to change this negative image through a joint promotion of our cultural and historical heritage and tourist offer, rather than separately and individually, as it has been the case so far.
World economic crisis will be reflected on tourism as well as on reduced possibilities of making investments in culture. In such a situation, a common cooperation of the countries may reduce the negative consequences of the world economic crisis on cultural tourist offer.
Bosnia and Herzegovina through regional cooperation with countries that have a stronger tradition in tourism and the economy, can significantly improve its tourist and development performances. Unfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina still does not entirely use its cultural diversity and richness for tourist purposes. In addition to the significant monuments of culture and natural beauty, for increased visits of international tourists, it is necessary to change the previous bad habits, accept the new European standards and train tourism managers and tourism workers. Tourist image of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be improved by the construction of the highway Corridor VC which connects the countries of our region.
Our goal in Bosnia and Herzegovina is to, preserving its cultural and historical identity and the richness of diversities, be a part of the wider European cultural and economic space. This can be achieved through tourism and opening of our cultural and historical sights to guests and tourists from both Europe and the world.
Welcome to Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Thank you."
35239,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojsa Radmanovic at the 6th Annual South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=35239&langTag=en-US,2009-05-23,"Dear Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the beginning I would like to express my gratitude to the organizers and auspices of this important event, primarily our host, the President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska, Mr. Igor Radojicic, for realizing the idea of gathering of the leaders from the region and the world.
Territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the wider Balkans and the Mediterranean region have an extraordinary importance for the contemporary cultural Europe. That importance is not only geopolitical that we are mostly speaking about, but primarily cultural and spiritual.
Cultural influences of three great religions are interwoven on this territory, and within them, each of the peoples developed their specific national culture. The level of development of those cultures is related to the economic prosperity of each society, and vice versa. Economic development is caused by the high cultural achievements.
The peoples of the Mediterranean Basin and their highly developed cultures have largely contributed to the development of human civilization. Unfortunately, many wars in the Balkans destroyed a lot of cultural and economic wealth, which is the reason for its being economically underdeveloped. This was also the reason why many social and cultural processes launched in this part of the world have never been completed.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans represent diverse cultural variety, a little mosaic of traditions and cultural experiences, unlike any other region in Europe.
Trust, peace and understanding amongst the peoples who live in this territory require respecting their cultural diversity but also restoration of the previous cultural importance that this region represents for the entire region and Europe in whole. It should be emphasized that where there are diversities there are also problems and opposite tendencies. Living in diversity understands everyone’s responsibility for everybody else.
In the past of this territory there were trends which, in the worst possible way, denied the richness of diversity: through the wars, undemocratic regimes, selectiveness and intolerance of all kinds, but, at the same time, there was always maintained and preserved a strong willingness to respect the differences and foster them within the regional and the European context.
Modern civilization context puts before us political and cultural claim to be both different and same at the same time.
In the past influences on this territory came from the developed countries towards the less developed ones. Today, thanks to globalization, the Western Balkans region has the opportunity to emit important cultural influences within a wider cultural space of Europe and the world. It is not only the sum of different national cultures but the quality of higher order and value. This stems from the fact that the contemporary cultural and political identities are not static and unchangeable categories, but open creations exposed to different influences due to intercultural cooperation and communication.
Together with this openness in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider region there are still a strong efforts to deny our diversity, which are reflected in the attempts to unify the language, nationalize history, invent the tradition, force cultural homogenization, etc. There are two extremes in those efforts: on one side, an uncritical highlighting, at any price, of the differences amongst similar peoples who live in a relatively small territory of the Western Balkans, and, on the other hand, the denial of any differences that do exist in the real life. Because of all this, our choice is between the two options: to be entrenched in our tradition and prejudice or to be open to new influences in the united Europe as a wider context of our future common home.
Regardless of the obvious differences which represent the wealth of the region, nations and countries in Europe, call upon the same values today. Someone once said, if we opened the people we would find landscapes within.
Europe is a continent of culture, national traditions, but also common values of civilization. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with the three peoples, different cultures and religions. Bosnia and Herzegovina and its overall national cultural landscape naturally correspond into what Europe wants to become in the future.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Right to diversity is the basic foundation of modern society democracy. This entitlement includes cultural pluralism as an authentic expression of existence of different cultures in equal, tolerant and open relationship.
In the area of South East Europe, and especially the Western Balkans, there are nations with very similar cultures. Try as they may to look different from each other, the peoples of South-Eastern Europe look similar to those who glimpse at them from outside. Free existence of different original cultures, having inherited many common values of civilization, is the imperative of our time. We should not either hide, or overemphasize our differences. Sometimes there are more similarities than differences. The image we show to the world depends on us. Whether we will build our relations on disagreements about the myths of the past or a dialogue about the future hopes, entirely depend on us.
In the end, survival of our difference is not in contradiction with the necessary unity on our European way into the united Europe, whose active participants we want to be.
Thank you."

Nebojsa Radmanovic, Energy Summit ""Natural Gas for Europe: Security and Partnership"", Sofia, 24",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=34877&langTag=en-US,2009-04-24,"It is my exceptional pleasure to greet all the participants of this Summit. Let me thank the President Parvanov for convening and organizing this Summit.
Dear Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my exceptional pleasure to greet all the participants of this Summit. Let me thank the President Parvanov for convening and organizing this Summit.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Global political and economic changes at the end of the last and the beginning of this century encouraged the creation of a more interconnected energy market. These changes are caused by the need of ensuring competition, increasing efficiency and security in the energy supply, which represents a precondition for the economic growth and development. Our common need is to establish a stable regulatory and market framework capable of attracting investors in the energy sector, in order to ensure stability of energy supply, which is of crucial importance for our economic development and social stability. Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully committed to implement all the accepted obligations, because it sees the opportunity for a faster economic development and approaching towards the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has great development opportunities in the electrical energy sector. Estimates are that the existing installed power of 4052 MW of hydroelectric and thermo-electric power plants could be increased more than three times, with the construction of new hydroelectric power plants, by the modernization of the existing ones as well as in building new thermo-electric power plants. This development opportunity has been confirmed in the recent European Economic Community conference on investment in the production of renewable energy sources, held in Sarajevo. We are encouraged by the fact that the investors, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in this occasion, expressed their willingness to invest in power sector projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the South East Europe region. Current production of electricity, not only meets the domestic needs, but a part of electrical energy surplus is exported, which is not a common feature of this region.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Development trends of the energy sector are increasingly turning to the environment friendly sources, of which the natural gas has a significant role. Europe will, not only now, but also in the future, be more and more dependent on natural gas as an important energy source. Being a part of the European family, we will also have the need for increased consumption of natural gas, increased import, as well as the need for new projects that will provide new directions and sources in the natural gas supply. The recent gas crisis requires us to plan on a wider regional level to resolve the issue of a long-term stability and security in natural gas supply. To meet that goal the construction of the new gas routes and new facilities for the gas storages would be available to all interested countries, either directly or via neighboring countries on the basis of full openness, good-neighborly relations and solidarity. Therefore, we support initiatives for the implementation of all new gas corridors and projects, including Nabucco, Adriatic-Ionian and Southern Corridor and their interconnection, which will contribute to a more stable and secure natural gas supply to our countries. We express our willingness to participate in the realization of the common infrastructure gas projects.
There is no domestic production of natural gas in Bosnia and Herzegovina and it completely depends on import. Pipeline system of Bosnia and Herzegovina is linked with pipeline system of Serbia which is a transit supply route for the imported gas from Russia. The pipeline, in the total length of only 191 km, connects a small part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the direction of Zvornik-Kladanj-Sarajevo-Zenica, and is used for heating needs of the households, as well as the fuel in the two larger industrial customers, Alumina Factory ""Birac"" from Zvornik and Steel Factory
""Mittal Steel"" from Zenica.
In the regional and especially the European framework, Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently a small the natural gas consumer. In the total consumption of energy, natural gas participates with about 6%. The current gas infrastructure is developed only in one part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus the access to this important fuel is only available to a limited number of users. Natural gas supply from one source and one direction does not provide security in the consumers’ supply.
Countries of South East Europe are situated on the directions of several planned large gas corridors for distributing gas to this region. It is often the case that the countries which use the gas are the very impediment to construction of the gas corridors due to their being divided and monopolized. Therefore, we must create a common approach to this issue which can result in a direct short-term and long-term economic and the development benefits for all of us.
In this way, the issue of secure natural gas supply of the regions of South East Europe would improve the overall regional cooperation of our countries, which, both individually and jointly, qualifies us as reliable and credible partners on our way of accession towards the European Union.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Increase of the natural gas participation in meeting the energy needs, represents our strategic goal and interest. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to build transport and distribution gas infrastructure throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and ensure the supply from several directions, by connecting the gas system to the systems of neighboring countries, which would ensure security and stability in the natural gas supply. We believe that, in the future, natural gas will have an important role in energy supply, among others, due to the additional and more favorable environmental characteristics in comparison to other fossil fuels. Apart from that, we are aware that in the near future we will have to harmonize the current lower prices of electricity in the internal market with higher prices in the neighboring countries and the countries of the European Union. This way the natural gas, being a cheaper fuel, will become a necessary substitute for electricity in the heating system in the cities, as well as fuel in the industrial plants wherever justified and practically possible.
With ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty on establishing the Energy Community of the South East Europe, Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed the obligation to implement the directions of the European Union into domestic legislation which regulates the natural gas. Establishment of the regulatory framework, despite the occasional delays and disputes, means progressing in the right direction in order to create a transparent and competitive market, which will provide secure gas supply and favorable environment for new investments.
The need to strengthen mutual connections and solidarity in the regional and European gas network proved necessary during the last gas crisis caused by the inter-state disputes about the transport, payments and natural gas prices. Then it was expressed a better linking and solidarity between the European countries and countries of the region. I avail myself of this opportunity to thank the government and the state leadership of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Hungary, which have expressed their full solidarity with the citizens of Sarajevo, Zenica and Zvornik, with intervening deliveries of natural gas during this January. This was a significant moral and political gesture, welcomed by the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the international community. That confirmed our readiness for solidarity, joint resolution of problems and development of mutual cooperation, for the benefit of the citizens of our countries and the entire region.
Thank you."

Dear friends of Matrix Croatica,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear guests, president of the Republic of Montenegro Mr Filip Vujanovic, dear friends!
We have been celebrating this extraordinary, renowned and praiseworthy cultural manifestation, Days of Matrix Croatica- Mostar Spring, for eleven years now.
In the time of economic and political crisis, this manifestation best conveys appreciation of diversity and preservation of identity of one of the constituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
International dimension of this year’s Mostar Spring encourages cooperation with our neighbours in the region, which is our obligation, as well as the necessity on the path to full membership in the European Union.
I am convinced that this manifestation will be a source of pride to citizens of Mostar and BiH citizens and return Mostar with good news to the center of cultural events in BiH, because the language of art and culture is the best means for building of trust and understanding in this society of ours, in spite of scars from the recent past.
This is an opportunity to show once again our unequivocal fondness for beauty and art, respect for our homeland, our peoples and customs, but also for all the other peoples and countries in the region.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must direct our attention and strivings towards the things we have in common, and those are richness of diversity of cultures and customs and our unique goal- full membership in the community of European peoples, where we have our place and role. Culture and art are part of obligations which we must bring along with pride and share with others in other to be better understood.
With the best wishes which I send to all those who contributed to organizing this manifestation, on my own behalf, as the sponsor of the manifestation, and on behalf of the BiH Presidency, I would like to pronounce Mostar Spring 2009 open.
Thank you!"
34401,Address by the chairman of the BiH Presidency Mr Nebojsa Radmanovic at the international conference “Where Peace Begins: Pivotal Role of Education for Lasting Peace”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=34401&langTag=en-US,2009-03-12,"It is an honor that exactly Bosnia and Herzegovina is hosting the International Conference that deals with the important role of education for lasting peace, because we believe that with our experience we can also promote the process. What kind of education can promote peace and how do we make sure that children receive quality education that will help them build peace?
Dear Mr. Chairman,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Allow me to extend a welcome to all participants and guests who are attending this international conference. I wish you a pleasant evening and a successful conference.
Especially I would like to thank the government of the Kingdom of Norway that provided support for this conference as well as international organization Save the Children. Without their help the results we achieved in promotion of education of young people would not be as great as they are today.
It is an honor that exactly Bosnia and Herzegovina is hosting the International Conference that deals with the important role of education for lasting peace, because we believe that with our experience we can also promote the process. What kind of education can promote peace and how do we make sure that children receive quality education that will help them build peace?
These were the questions asked by organization Save the Children in March 2008, when it launched a global debate in order to invite Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, educationalists and representatives of governments to contribute to a greater understanding of the links between education and peace.
In September 2008 Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of the six countries that requested the President of the United Nations General Assembly to launch a debate on an issue that was of a great importance for the prompt response to exceptional circumstances and reconstruction process: the issue of approach to education in exceptional circumstances, post-conflict and transition situations caused by human conflicts or natural disasters.
I have to remind you that the right to education is defined by the General Convention on Human Rights adopted in 1948. Convention on the Rights of the Children obliges all States Parties to ensure that all children have access to education free from discrimination on any grounds. This Convention defines the right to a free and compulsory primary education. States are encouraged to develop secondary education and other forms of education and make them accessible and available to all. States Parties shall promote international cooperation in the area of education.
However, the real situation in many parts of the world and especially in conflict or natural disaster affected areas indicates that we are falling behind in our determination to achieve the second millennium development goal calling upon the member states to establish a universal primary education by 2015.
Approximately 75 million children still do not go to school and more than a half of them live in conflict-affected areas. Girls comprise more than a half of these groups whereas many children live in areas affected by natural disasters.
In addition to implementing all internationally adopted regulations and standards it is necessary to work more on social cohesion of people living in conflict-affected areas. United Nations need to refocus and divert attention as well as implement and secure the fundamental right to education. Organizing a thematic debate at the session of the General Assembly on probably the biggest obstacle to exercising this right – the access to education in exceptional circumstances, post-conflict and transition situation resulting from human conflicts and natural disasters - would be a timely and necessary step. The debate would provide a better overview of future activities, better coordination between participants and a dialogue on numerous topics such as finding children who do not go to school due to abovementioned circumstances. By ensuring the right to education in exceptional circumstances the international community could send an important message about the future.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Education is a key factor in development of society. Two years ago the world marked hundredth anniversary of education sociology. It was hundred years ago that this scientific discipline was formally included in education as a special subject. The importance of education can be seen in the fact that it is one of the priorities of united Europe. Education strongly encourages people to become members of community as well as broader European culture. Being an essential part of culture and an existential need, education has become an important precondition for competitiveness of contemporary economy. For the last few years Bosnia and Herzegovina has put enormous effort into education reform based on the model The Europe of Knowledge. Only an educated citizen can actively participate in social life, exercise democracy and contribute to economic and cultural development and progress of the community. The statement by a well known statesman who said:
“Being a European is not a matter of birth, but education”
proves the point.
Our wish is that the UN and the countries in the world acknowledge the importance of education and make use of debates on education in such conferences for promotion of this area of social life. I hope that today’s conference will send out significant recommendations and expert advice which can serve all countries to promote peace through education.
It is only in this way that results of education become lasting heritage to be passed on the future generations."
34319,Speech by the BiH Presidency Chairman Nebojsa Radmanovic at the regional conference’2009,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=34319&langTag=en-US,2009-03-10,"Today’s conference proves that there is a highly expressed awareness about importance and necessity of BiH accession to Euro Atlantic structures among all walks of life in BiH, from representatives of state and entity authorities and local communities, to entrepreneurs, NGO, civil society, media, religious communities and citizens.
Dear Chairman
Your Excellencies
Ladies and gentlemen
Allow me, at the beginning, to express my gratitude to organizers of this regional conference, first of all European Movement in BiH, and other organizers and participants of today’s meeting. I am grateful to have opportunity to express my view on the current and long-term possibilities of accession of BiH and the Western Balkans countries to Euro Atlantic integration.
Today’s conference proves that there is a highly expressed awareness about importance and necessity of BiH accession to Euro Atlantic structures among all walks of life in BiH, from representatives of state and entity authorities and local communities, to entrepreneurs, NGO, civil society, media, religious communities and citizens.
The fact that there is European Movement in BiH promoting the idea and values of united Europe contributes to raising awareness about EU integration. Other associations and citizen organizations are also important, because they work everyday in order to bring BiH closer to EU, putting the idea into practice. It was for that reason that I decided to sponsor such an important conference and other activities that European Movement in BiH is planning to undertake during the year 2009.
I am convinced that EU had justifiable reasons to announce 2009 as ‘the Year of the Balkans’. Apart from common symbolic, there is more to it than meets the eye: there is deliberate intention to steer the Western Balkans countries in the direction of EU during this and following years. This year is, to a certain extent, crucial for BiH and other Western Balkans countries to shed the heavy load of long-standing isolation from European processes and take decisive steps towards European integration path.
These circumstances call for a short review of the position of the Balkans as compared to Europe, in the past and now, which can be useful in understanding of our ambitions in the future.
The relation between Europe and the Balkans was defined in the past between the two extremes: systematic negligence and violent interventions in the internal relations in the Balkans. Both approaches proved to be wrong in the long term. In practice, as regards political life, such approach was more detrimental than useful to peoples and countries of the Balkans.
The history of the region of the Western Balkans is fraught with wrong and reckless interventions by great forces and lack of understanding of objective political processes in this part of the world, which entailed wrong solutions which failed to bring stability, democracy and economic progress. The Balkans, as geopolitical region, has been unfairly and wrongly perceived in a negative way, as a region prone to permanent and insoluble conflicts and crises. The stereotype lingered for quite some time, and it is still dominant in the mindset of an average European. It was the reason for systematic negligence and isolation of the region from the rest of the Europe, which brought about enormous damage to the process of prompt integration of the region in political, economic and cultural life of Europe. The complexity and importance of the Balkans as a strategic region connecting West and Central Europe with the Mediterranean and Near East was disregarded.
Viewed from today’s perspective, we can say that responsibility for such a state in the Balkans rests first of all with political elite of their countries, but also with great forces and international community. The current political situation in BiH and other Balkan countries is part of broader political context of outstanding issues which originate from the area of the so-called ‘East Issue’, annexing of BiH by Austria-Hungary, Balkan wars, World War I, creation of Yugoslavia and finally, its disintegration during the last decade of the twentieth century. In the last 150 years, the region of Balkans saw world war, Balkan wars and several local wars. The region of BiH and the Balkans was the scene of conflict and collapse of great empires, and all these conflicts affected the political situation in those countries.
Following majority of wars led from 1991 to 2001, the region of Western Balkans enjoys a peaceful period, which is obviously the most important thing. War conflicts resulted in a high death toll, a vast number of wounded and refugees, and almost complete destruction of economy. With intervention by international community, several peace agreements were made in the Western Balkans- which definitely brought an end to war, establishing peace and stability in the region.
I would like to highlight at this point the importance of peace agreements made after the ending of conflict in this region. Some of them, like Dayton/Paris peace agreement for BiH, not only ended hostilities, but they also defined political solution.
Dayton Peace Agreement from 1995 was a highlight of the political and diplomatic invention of peacemakers and home politicians, and it is one of the greatest success stories of peacemaking in the history.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Europe has confirmed clearly that its strategic interest was integration of the region of the Western Balkans in European political, economic and security structures. The Western Balkans countries, on their part, clearly voiced their firm commitment to Euro Atlantic structures.
There is a high percentage of citizens and political parties in BiH that opt for EU accession. Wide acknowledgement of BiH as a country which belongs to Europe in all terms: historical, geographic, political, and cultural- contributes to the high percentage, regardless of the fact that it is not formally an EU member. Last year, BiH signed SAA, which is the first contractual relation between BiH and EU in the process of EU integration.
It is an important and incentive step for the country on its path to full EU membership. Also, in the same year, the relation between BiH and NATO Alliance was raised to the level of intensive dialogue, which is a step forward towards full membership. In that respect, we cannot be dissatisfied with the results achieved at the level of Euro Atlantic integration of the country. However, in the last months the country faced a temporary standstill regarding this issue. Political differences between BiH parties contributed to the standstill.
Long-term strategic stabilization of the Western Balkans will start with final solutions to the outstanding issues which are stumbling block between certain countries in the region. These issues include: questionable independence of Kosovo and Metohija, adjudication of FYROM, dispute between Slovenia and Croatia over the mainland border, efforts to undermine Dayton Peace Accords, which is the cornerstone of stability of BiH as democratic, decentralized and complex state with two entities and three equal peoples.
In the last few years, the Western Balkans has experienced ‘the shock of Europesation’, the process which strikes one as a fever which spreads through society and changes our previous habits and relations completely. It is more than obvious today, and experience of other countries proves it, that EU integration process is an all-encompassing, comprehensive venture and effort of the whole society, not only an exclusive responsibility of state institutions. When a country becomes EU member, it is not its government, or part of society that becomes the member, it is the country as a whole, as a result of joint effort to achieve the set goal,. On that path, apart from state institutions, legislative and executive authorities, everyone is in invited and welcome, from companies that make effort to reach European standards and results, to civil society which strives to embed the spirit of European integration into its daily performance and communication with citizens.
There are shared responsibilities, on this path, including our society, and also between BiH and EU as institutional and political framework that the country is attempting to join. Our responsibility is to fulfill all the conditions and aims we obliged to do, and EU’s responsibility is to accept the results and provide necessary support for further progress in that process.
Today, the Western Balkans is between marginalization and integration. Promises made at numerous EU summits regarding European perspective of the region must not be failed, because it would push the Western Balkans in a bigger depression and isolation. Hesitation of Europe in that respect already breeds skepticism towards Europe in BiH and other Western Balkans countries. Quite contrary, integration processes of the Western Balkans in EU must be intensified and accompanied by concrete financial and political measures which would put in motion a fast economic development of the region.
Dispute between Slovenia and Croatia over the outstanding issues of sea border, which led to a standstill in accession negotiations of Croatia in EU integration process illustrate what these issues can bring about, when they are fuelled by important and long lasting differences. Such a situation results in ‘domino effect’ which can in the future spread on other Western Balkans countries, which could lead to new obstacles in the EU integration process.
The Western Balkans still has negative connotations to its name with the international public. Such a negative image can be successfully toned down, if every country worked separately. It is only done by joint effort and cooperation of all the countries of the region and by involving all the political, economic and human resources at hand. EU must fortify its engagement in intensifying regional cooperation between the Western Balkans countries in all walks of life, in order to resolve the outstanding issues that encumber their relations nowadays.
Economic and cultural cooperation between the states can be an important element of integration and stabilization of the Western Balkan countries within states and Europe as well. It is about existing bonds, but cultural, linguistic and other similarities between peoples can build a bridge of cooperation, which can enrich Europe considerably.
Which direction is it appropriate to take in order to explore possibilities for prompt accession of BiH and Western Balkans countries to Euro Atlantic integration?
When it comes to BiH, it is, first of all, closure and transformation of OHR as an institution inappropriate for the new phase of integration processes. Under current conditions, the Protectorate Country is attempting to access the association of its protector, which is unprecedented in international relations. It is high time that BiH and EU established a normal accession relation based on trust and fulfillment of obligations. Transformation of OHR into the Office of EU Special Representative would be a definitive step towards EU, which has no turning point. It would be a clear message to home authorities to take responsibility and offer and search for solutions to their own problems in the spirit of EU accession obligations.
BiH must have equal status with other countries of the Western Balkans region in terms of its opportunities to join EU integration processes. With OHR in BiH, it is impossible. At this point, it means two things: gaining EU membership candidacy for all Western Balkans countries simultaneously, and establishing visa- free regime of all countries with EU. All the region of the Western Balkans with other five (countries without visa-free regime) countries has less population than Romania. Many parameters of social, political and economic state in the Western Balkans countries are similar to those that have recently been accepted to EU. Hence, the process must not be stalled and brought into question by ambiguous rhetoric and inexplicit messages from Brussels. Recent statement by EU Enlargement Commissioner about abolition of visas for the Western Balkans countries by the end of the year is an encouraging act by Brussels administration.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The history of the Western Balkans was characterized by frequent changes of geopolitical structure. Common characteristic of regional security dynamics is temporary character of structures, which failed to consolidate as a stable, permanent state. For the first time, the Western Balkans has an opportunity to become a stable, safe connection between the center of Europe and its Southern periphery. For such a venture, we need the help of Europe. We must develop integral approach of EU accession, and focus strongly on the final aim of the integration, which is fulfillment of conditions for full EU membership. On that path, we must leave behind petty, partial and other issues which can present an obstacle to the main, final goal. Our long-standing internal disputes and common accession and other issues can be solved in integration process of united Europe which will make room for the Western Balkans countries.
I am aware that it is not popular to give unreal promises. I am also aware that by painting reality black, hard as it might be, is not fair to citizens. Elected politicians are there to give hope, retrieve optimism and show the way forward, and that is why we must work harder and believe that we will finally achieve what we are all committed to, democratically.
Maybe on this path we could use some advice:
'Will the Balkans open its sleepy eyes, see its enormous cultural capacity, if it swings as a whole?' , wrote a famous novelist more than 50 years ago.
We that live and work in the Western Balkans countries know that it is possible. It takes more work, committment and responsibility and final aim will not go amiss.
Thank you

34208,"The speech by the BiH Presidency member, H.E. Zeljko Komsic, on the occasion of celebrating BiH Independence Day",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=34208&langTag=en-US,2009-02-27,"Let me express my gratitude that you joined our celebration of the landmark in the recent history of BiH, its Independence Day. It is a day marked with gold letters in the thousand-year-old history of BiH, because on March 1, 1992 we held a referendum on independence of BiH.
Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests and friends...
Let me express my gratitude that you joined our celebration of the landmark in the recent history of BiH, its Independence Day. It is a day marked with gold letters in the thousand-year-old history of BiH, because on March 1, 1992 we held a referendum on independence of BiH.
It was on that thay that a vast majority of BiH citizens started implementing their democratic decision. Also, on that very day, a historic path of hell began for BiH, as a sovereign independence state, accompanied by the most difficult war circumstances.
We only had our indomitable will and courage of those who loved their homeland as weapons against the enemies of BiH and the enemies of people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We had nothing more, but it was quite enough! We had nothing on our side at that time! There were plenty of enemies. The true friends of our country were few. The truth is, we had too many false friends!
We, people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, believed in our country then, we believed we were doing something quie normal and expected. When they jeopardize and attack your family, friends, home, freedom, homeland, what else can one do but fight for it all.
That is why this might be an opportunity to send a message to all those who think BiH and its people are tired, exhausted, at odds, divided, and that it is the right time for political implementation of war goals.
This is opportunity to tell them, do not even think about it! Back in 1992 you also thought you could tear this country apart in few days.
There is no policy, circumstance or force that could allow you to do that. BiH can only dissapear if its people give it up! And it will never happen! Every inch of this land, every piece of this ground, belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of its name, and its every part has belonged, belongs and will belong to every person in Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless, also, of their name!
Dear friends...
It is high time we understood reality and started building the future on that grounds. No one here has another homeland. All of us, either far away, or here, are foreigners to them. We are merely from Bosnia or Herzegovina to them. We remain a single state, we can not single out an inch of this blood drenched country, and we owe apsolutely nothing to anyone.
We are part of former Yugoslavia, part of the Balkans, but also part of Europe and we will act that way, but we will also harmonize our way of life, work and obeyance of European standards in all walks of life from the smallest, most common human ways to educational, cultural, religious scientific, technological, economic ways.
However, we, people of Bosnia and Herzegovina will also have to reconcile each other! Because, it is only natural in this country, it is the only way in this country! Respect each other, listen to each other, try to understand each other! Otherwise, pardon my French, it will all ‘ go to hell’!
Because in this country, no one owns either the country , or any part of it!
It is our common country, it belongs to all of us!
We have to apply self-criticism and realize that we have over 700 000 unemployed people, low birth rate, that 9 out of 10 young people want to leave our country. Disabled people are forced to pull down the doors of BiH Parliament in order to reason with authorities! Only someone naive, a liar or malicious person can think or say that everything is all right in our country. Of course it is not so, but we have to work hard to change that!
It will take a lot of hard, honest, thorough work! We must be ready for that! We are up for it, sooner or later. Certainly better now than later!
With more willingness, less fear, less vanity, more reconciliation with each other, which is our destiny, we are looking at unimaginable horizons of prosperity and progress of our country.
Dear people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this is our homeland, our Bosnia and Herzegovina, and such as it is, it is only ours, we respect it and we are loyal to it!
May its seventh anniversary of independence, as well as all the forthcoming independence anniversaries be better and merrier.
Thank you!

Dr Haris Silajdzic on the occasion of celebrating BiH Independence Day,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=34234&langTag=en-US,2009-02-27,"Throughout our history, we had to defend our independence, and this generation also had to do it. Thus I feel it is the right time to say that we owe a debt of gratitude to all those who defended this country, and those who gave their lives during the last aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina or fought for its freedom.
My colleague in BiH Presidency, Mr Zeljko Komsic has already said most of the things I wanted to say. Let me greet you, dear Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, and express my gratitude that you joined us in celebrating this important day for us, BiH Independence Day.
Throughout our history, we had to defend our independence, and this generation also had to do it. Thus I feel it is the right time to say that we owe a debt of gratitude to all those who defended this country, and those who gave their lives during the last aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina or fought for its freedom.
We express our gratitude to those who made effort, and who will continue to do so, those in internatonal community helping us build a democratic, rather than ethnocratic country. A democratic country of equal citizens on every inch of this territory. In order to solve all the tasks, political and economic, which are difficult, this country must function properly, and it is not the case at the moment. I hope that we will all together fulfill that task, for people who brought us here, myself and my colleague Mr Komsic and Chairman Radmanovic, who is absent, those we are here for expect us to do it.
To conclude, I must say that today I had opportunity to spend some time with Association 'Children- pillars of the world'. They call themselves like that, and that is what they are. I would like to greet them, they are here with us now. Among the messages they conveyed, they singled out this one: 'We want to become a member of the European Union, we braced ourselves for that '. Let us all make their wish come true.
Thank you"

Dear ladies and gentlemen, members of the BiH Armed forces, dear guests...
Let me greet you on behalf of the BiH Presidency and my own behalf, give you my heartfelt welcome and wish you a happy return to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation for successfuly completed tasks you were given within the peacekeeping mission in Iraq.
We are here, today, all happy, proud, and satisfied with your engagement.
We are happy because all our members of the BiH Armed Forces returned safe and sound, from a dangerous mission in Iraq, to the loved ones, those who awaited their return with suspense and fear.
We are proud that you completed all your military tasks within your mission, your role resembling the one of BiH ambassadors, at the highest professional level, with highest grades. We are satisfied that your quality showed the world that we are a serious, responsible country, and that there is no task you are not capable of fulfilling, even in extreme conditions. Representing our country with dignity and fulfilling complex, risky tasks in peacekeeping missions around the world is something we all must take pride in, because quite often it is forgotten that your engagement contributes to the reputation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will in the future participate in international peacekeeping missions in various regions of the world. It is a responsibility of the Ministry of Defense and BiH Armed Forces as a whole, especially its command department, to prepare for the participation in these missions with a quality training and continuing work with people at all levels.
Regardless of the current global economic crisis, representatives of authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina must understand that these Armed Forces deserve all the necessary support and improvement of the conditions of life and work in every respect.
I will personally see to it that all the budget allocations for BiH Armed Forces are raised to the necessary level, a level in accordance with NATO requirements, because Bosnia and Herzegovina’ s path to full membership in NATO Alliance must not be stalled in any way.
Finally, I would like to wish you all a lot of happiness and satisfaction in the days to come, congratulating you all forthcoming holidays.
Once again, welcome and thank you all."

Marking December 1, Day of BiH Armed Forces is our joint recollection of contribution of many people, who put a lot of energy, effort, knowledge and expertise in the process of establishment of BiH Armed Forces.
Your Excellency,
Dear generals, officers, non-commissioned officers, soldiers,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a special pleasure to address you on the third anniversary of establishment of Day of BiH Armed Forces in the name of BiH Presidency, as civil command of BiH Armed Forces.
Marking December 1, Day of BiH Armed Forces is our joint recollection of contribution of many people, who put a lot of energy, effort, knowledge and expertise in the process of establishment of BiH Armed Forces.
Today, when we celebrate for the third time Day of BiH Armed Forces, we should remember all the hardships and obstacles we had to overcome on our way, in order to arrive at joint organization of BiH Armed Forces, and pay respect to all those who take credit that we succeeded in that mission.
Three years might be too short a period to comprehend the significance and importance of this achievement. The time ahead will show how important reform step forming of Armed Forces was for BiH, its peace stability, trust and equality of the three constituent peoples.
Why did we succeed in achieving planned reforms in the area of defense and security sector and efficiently established BiH Armed Forces?
It is due to our patient, committed, step-by- step work that we achieved reforms. We built mutual trust, respecting equality of all three constituent peoples, as a guiding principle underlying our relations. We also succeeded owing to the fact that we consulted opinion and proposals based on expertize and science from this area and had advisory help from international community.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina we have a broad consensus for accession to EU and NATO, which is a respectable political attitude, bearing in mind that we have different opinion on many issues in the country. BiH has seen many reforms and changes in various areas of political, economic and social life in general. However, reform of Armed Forces is an example of a successful reform in a post-conflict society which gives us the right to believe that it will continue in the future, with the same or stronger dynamics. This reform is example for other areas as well, if we wish to succeed in conducting necessary reforms and changes on our path to EU integration. As we are talking about a very complex, gradual and balanced process of reforms, it takes vision, determination and patience of all the actors for the reforms to succeed.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Celebrating December 1, we must not forget that once independent components and now united BiH Armed Forces have given a great contribution to the implementation of Dayton Peace Agreement, development of trust and cooperation between conflicted parties and building of lasting and sustainable peace in the BiH region.
Within the framework of general activities of bringing BiH closer to EU and other Euro Atlantic integration, this year, an ‘Intensive dialogue’ with NATO alliance has been established, making another major step towards final membership in this organization.
After accession to NATO program ‘Partnership for Peace’, it is a new ladder of progress of our Armed Forces, which will entail new responsibilities in the future, and reaching other standards, as requested by NATO Alliance.
BiH Armed Forces, within its possibilities give necessary contribution to collective safety in the world through engagement in joint activities of securing peace in crisis-affected areas.
Several days ago, the BiH Presidency adopted ‘Defense policy’, a document which, together with Safety policy and General principles and priority for conduction of foreign policy of BiH represent a long-term, general strategic and conceptual framework of political activities of the country.
Also, the BiH Presidency, at its last session, named three liaison officers in the mission of BiH with NATO in Brussels, which will make our communication with Euro Atlantic safety structures more efficient and quality.
Finally, I would like to congratulate you on the Day of BiH Armed Forces, wishing you a lot of success in the future work.
Thanks"

Councilors of ZAVNOBIH, dear comrades, ladies and gentlemen, Your Excellencies, dear friends, respected officials…
On today’s day, exactly 65 yaers ago, at the first session of ZAVNOBIH held in Mrkonjic Grad, 173 councilors from Bosnia and Herzegovina took part in the session.
Out of 173 afore mentioned councilors, 8 are still alive. Unfortunately, for health reasons following councilors are not attending this ceremony: Boro Popovic, Ibro Sator, Rade Hamovic and Enver Redzic. However, we have the honour to host other councilors, including: Krstan Bijeljac, Oskar Danon, Ljubo Babic and Mile Perkovic. I would kindly ask you to greet them.
I extend my sincere greetings to you all and congratulate you the National Day.
Celebrating this national holiday, when 65 years ago in Mrkonjic Grad, in Europe besieged by fascism, in the middle of seized territory, a landmark occurred in the history of our country, let us recall this important historic date, as a foundation stone, upon which modern, democratic BiH rests.
I will not repeat this time the legendary ‘3 and’ or ‘nor 3’ from the ZAVNOBIH session, but I will remind you that it was the session of the Council of BiH antifascist from all the BiH peoples. It is true that antifascist movement was led by communists, but the fact is that most antifascist and patriots were not members of Communist party of Yugoslavia.
I would like to point out that we are talking about the event which not only confirms the continuity of the BiH statehood, in the only right way. And that is- every citizen of BiH is equal in his rights and way of life, regardless of the part of BiH he lives in, and regardless of the fact whether or not he belongs to ‘majority or minority’ in that part of our homeland. Or, to put it simplier-Bosnia and Herzegovina, every part of it, even the smallest one, belongs to every BiH citizen.
In its history which is thousands of years old, its peoples have demonstrated, although they suffered and lived through numerous blows dealt by various enemies and policies, that peace, tolerance, and co-existence become something of a genetic code, to put it that way.
I would like to send out the message to our friends from international community, to those, who, as opposed to us from Bosnia and Herzegovina, all this might not strike them as something close and familiar.
I am aware of the fact that, those who do not wish well to our country, tell stories to you who are not from here, trying to convince you of something, present you with the so-called historical facts, that almost ‘the natural condition’ of this country is conflict, lack of tolerance, and the only way to peace and stability is division, separation, ethnic disintegration, to the stories that BiH should be wiped off the face of political world map.
However, if that is the way things are, don’t you think that this country would have disintegrated before, and that history would have waited for its present enemies to complete the task?
Bosnia and Herzegovina has neither disintegrated nor separated before the forces of that time, including Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hitler’s Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, Ustasas’ NDH, cetnik military movement, before neighbouring fascists at the end of the XX century. Those were forces too strong for such a small country, but small BiH still exists. I think that all things said lead to a irrefutable conclusion!
Conflicts and wars in BiH have always been bloody and fierce, but according to historical parameters, they lasted shortly, and most importantly, they were always imported, started beyond the boundaries of BiH.
Dear friends…
There is no doubt that ZAVNOBIH is a foundation stone of modern BiH statehood, but also that it is a model which points to the way we cannot only live together, but equitably and happily, something that no country can live without.
If we live in the same country, if we are the citizens of the same country, than the minimum of civilized behaviour, historical recollection and civic culture implies to celebrate today’s date as the common national holiday of all its citizens and peoples.
As for the appropriate mode of celebrating the National Day, that is, the reason for not celebrating it in certain parts of BiH, I would like to repeat the following:
The date of signing the Dayton Peace Agreement I consider as an important date in the recent history of BiH, which should be celebrated in a dignified manner, but 25th November, the date of celebration of ZAVNOBIH, and reaching decisions, I personally find of utmost importance, as a crucial landmark, and the sole National Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is the task of this generation to path the way towards the common future, and that is free, democratic and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our only future is BiH as the unity of equal and egalitarian peoples, a society composed of equal and egalitarian citizens where there would not be those with fewer or no rights, and those with more rights.
Finally, what we must remember on today’s path to Europe is that we must learn from Europe, take advice, learn from its experience, of course, not haphazardly, and never fail to remember that we can and must do for ourselves mostly by our own forces.
With the wish to remain adamant in building and strengthening of our country, as a country of well-being, security, and common well-being, I would like once again to extend my sincere congratulations on the occasion of the National Day!
Thank you!"

Our country is celebrating today the 65th anniversary of the first session of ZAVNOBIH, held in Mrkonjic Grad, where the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed.
Ladies and Gentlemen, respected Excellencies, dear friends,
It is a great honor to bid you welcome to the reception on the occasion of the BiH National Day. Our country is celebrating today the 65th anniversary of the first session of ZAVNOBIH, held in Mrkonjic Grad, where the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed.
During the first 65 years, Bosnia and Herzegovina has come a long way of defense and affirmation of its statehood. Those who made a stand against fascism remained loyal to Bosnia and Herzegovina, confirming its viability as a state. The next generation continued this struggle, especially during the aggression (1992-1995)
First of all, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to those who contributed to this struggle, especially those who sacrificed their lives. Today we remember them with great admiration. It is thanks to them, now we have a privilege to live in our own country, whose sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Thanks to them Bosnia and Herzegovina is a full member of the international community of states. Thanks to them we are here today. It is them that we owe the obligation to continue building a sense of statehood, especially through affirmation of rights and interests of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We must always bear in mind that state exists to ensure its citizens economic security and economic development, and create conditions for a better standard of living. One of the challenges ahead is to adequately and timely respond to negative effects of global economic crisis, which is already being felt by BiH citizens.
At the session of BiH Presidency tomorrow, we will consider possible measures that BiH institutions should take in order to protect the citizens from the effects of that crisis. I would like to call all the political actors in the country to leave disputes aside and focus on preparation and realization of those measures, with joint forces, without any delay.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Some people might be afraid for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nowadays, some people doubt that this country is capable of responding to challenges ahead. Due to these doubts and fears, some think that survival of this state might be ensured by weakening rather than affirmation of its statehood attributes. There have been many attempts in the history of BiH to bring its survival in question, even by means of arms. However, one thing is certain. All those attempts were futile, but only because defenders of BiH remained committed to their principles they affirmed in Mrkonjic Grad. Not only do those principles represent the brightest point in our history, they are also the key link of the future. Not a single inch of this country has ever been Serbian, Croat or Bosniak, it belonged to all the BiH peoples. So it used to be. It will be so in the future, because what brings us together is much stronger than what tears us apart."

Nebojša Radmanović at the Regional Economic Forum South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=32825&langTag=en-US,2008-11-21,"It is my pleasure to greet you and to thank the organizer for inviting me to participate in this Forum. It is of a crucial importance for our European future and regional cooperation to exchange our views and experiences and encourage cooperation in all areas of importance to our peoples as well as mutually good relations trough these or similar gatherings.
Esteemed Presiding,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to greet you and to thank the organizer for inviting me to participate in this Forum. It is of a crucial importance for our European future and regional cooperation to exchange our views and experiences and encourage cooperation in all areas of importance to our peoples as well as mutually good relations trough these or similar gatherings.
Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved considerable recovery and economic prosperity in the past 13 years. Strong investment activity, financed by donations of the international community, has contributed to the high post-war GDP real growth rate. What encourages us is the fact that economic growth was also continued after the foreign help was reduced. In the period 2002 – 2007, the average economic growth was 5.2 % annually, which puts Bosnia and Herzegovina at the equal status with other states of the former Yugoslavia. In spite of this, Bosnia and Herzegovina is lagging behind its neighbors, concerning GDP per capita. The reasons for that greatly lie in the past war events, which left marks on its economy and population.
Bosnia and Herzegovina was successful in achieving macroeconomic stability. Domestic currency – Convertible Mark is stable, with the constant growth of foreign exchange reserves. The fiscal budget balance has been established, thanks to the successful tax reforms, and especially the introduction of value added tax. Fiscal discipline has been intensified due to establishment of the treasury business transactions and the public sector audit office. Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to establish a competitive banking sector with strong supervisory bodies.
Long lasting unemployment rate and high foreign trade deficit represent the main hindrance to the economic growth and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is due to the low rankings in competitiveness of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy. We are aware that the competitive economy cannot be accomplished only by creating the stable macroeconomic environment. It is necessary to build the efficient institutions, mastering the contemporary technologies, developing corporative management, investing into research and development, together with the appropriate level of economic freedom and entrepreneur capacities. Building competitive economy represents a difficult, lasting and complex process that requires constant and persistent work, which is confirmed by experiences of developed countries. We must use all our creative energy in fostering competitive economy for our better future and the well-being for the generations to come.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is significantly lagging behind in building necessary infrastructure for joining the European integration and global market. Therefore, we are not surprised by the huge efforts put in by the European Union in investing infrastructure in order to ensure relatively equal conditions for development of all regions. The road infrastructure of Bosnia and Herzegovina has become an impediment for a greater scope of foreign trade cooperation with the neighborhood and the world. That is why our Entities’ governments put in efforts to fix the situation in that field using concessions and our own resources. I would like to use this opportunity to express our readiness to build major regional road routes, trough joint ventures that would contribute to the faster development of the entire region.
Looking towards the future, the key challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina and its economic development is in utilization of the electric power potentials through building new power generating plants, in order to resolve the growing needs in power supply in the country, and increase the export scope within the regional market. Entities’ governments have been undertaking the numerous initiatives and steps on attracting and engaging foreign capital for modernization the existing ones, as well as in building new capacities. The encouraging fact is that there is a great interest of foreign investors for investing in the power sector. That also represents a challenge for the countries of our region to start building electric power capacities, through joint ventures. Bosnia and Herzegovina is open for that way of cooperation.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are about to face the years of high uncertainty, caused by the world financial crisis. It is sure that the economic crisis will not avoid this region. There is no doubt that the international financial crisis will indirectly influence the countries of the whole region and reduce the prospects for continuation of high economic growth rates from the previous years. In regard with Bosnia and Herzegovina, it could be expected that the economic crisis will reflect to several key segments. First, banking credits will be more expensive which will reduce the scope of investments and liquidity in the economy, the scope of total demand for goods and services, and slow down the economic growth. Second, there is a justified fear of lowering direct foreign investments flow. Third, recession, which will probably take Europe and the Region, being our most important foreign trade partners, will have a detrimental effect on export, which is our crucial need. Fourth, it could be expected that the value of our diaspora remittances lowers, particularly due to the recession which may cause loosing the jobs for part of this population. Fifth, further privatization of the state capital in the companies will be slowed down, since this is not a very favorable time for their sale.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has the advantage of having the foreign debt, both public and private, relatively small, compared to the countries in the broader Region. Level of the bank credits is also moderate, and the credits are quite well secured. These are significant advantages for mitigation of the economic crisis consequences.
Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Entities’ respective governments and the Central bank have undertaken necessary measures for preservation of financial stability. However, the future time will certainly require undertaking numerous new measures. Before all, more attention and efforts should be put in the issues which contribute to improvement of competitive abilities of the economy, in order to increase export. It is necessary, as much as possible, to direct a part of public expenditures into production purposes, in order to mitigate negative effects of investment reduction. Economic crisis imposes the need for protection of socially vulnerable categories of the population which are the most sensitive to its consequences. In simple terms, it is necessary to realize a more productive production, lower spending, higher saving, and export more while importing less.
Global crisis should be resolved jointly with other players, to the extent possible, at the same time not neglecting our own interests. In times like these, great economic powers primarily preserve their own interests. In our reality, we must not allow ourselves to be a collateral damage of the world financial crisis.
Global financial crisis requires global responses. The time has shown that it is impossible to manage the 21st century economics with the 20th century instruments. Many rules of playing in the world financial market must be changed, in order to have the global financial system preserved from any imprudent moves.
Thank you!"

Allow me to express my sadness at the passing of Lord Russell Johnston, who was your peer for twenty-three years and who ably presided over this Assembly between 1999 and 2002.

Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honor to address the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Allow me to express my sadness at the passing of Lord Russell Johnston, who was your peer for twenty-three years and who ably presided over this Assembly between 1999 and 2002. Lord Russell Johnston worked tirelessly on human rights issues until the very end, and our thanks and sympathies go to his loved ones.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Bosnia and Herzegovina highly values the work of the Council of Europe and its bodies and institutions. We have often been direct beneficiaries of this work, and have as a result of it made improvements with respect to the rule of law, human rights, and democracy. For this, I convey to you the gratitude of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are mindful, however, that we continue to face a number of obstacles We have a long way to go before Bosnia and Herzegovina is able to live up to the principles that constitute the very foundation of this body.
Even the progress that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made often falls prey to the discriminatory arrangements that are built into our system of governance. While Bosnia and Herzegovina was among the first five countries to ratify Protocol 12 to the European Convention, it is the only country in Europe, and the world, whose Constitution, bars some of its citizens from seeking office solely on the basis of their ethnicity.
To be sure, the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the war, aggression and genocide. Its value in such a context cannot be denied. But Dayton was also intended to reduce discrimination and reverse the effects of genocide and ethnic cleansing. On paper, it had all the necessary elements to do so.
Indeed, Annex 7 of Dayton guarantees that all refugees and displaced persons shall have a right to “return in safety, without risk of harassment, intimidation, persecution, or discrimination, particularly on account of their ethnic origin…” In practice, and in the words of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitutional Court, we have been witnessing:
“a systemic, continuing and deliberate practice of the public authorities of Republika Srpska with the goal of preventing the so-called ‘minority’ returns, either through direct participation in violent incidents or through the abdication of responsibility to protect the people from…violent attacks due solely to their ethnic background.”
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This matter, clearly, is not solely our concern. On the contrary, we are hearing statements this week, in these halls, that the right to return in another European context is not an important right, as demonstrated by the fact that it was never implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Do these statements suggest that Republika Srpska has succeeded in creating an international precedent? Does one get to keep the ethnically clean slate created by butchering and expelling those who are different?
If that is allowed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it will serve as a dangerous precedent and will seriously undermine this institution’s other objectives in my country. Dayton was clearly not designed with a la carte implementation in mind, as one of its components cannot function without the full functioning of the others. Obstruction of some of Dayton’s elements was born precisely out of a desire to stifle democracy and preserve ethnocracy.
One effect of this obstruction is that entity voting has morphed into an ethno-territorial mechanism, whereby only 22 percent of deputies in the State Parliament, all of them Serbs, and all of them from Republika Srpska, can block any decision they desire. Indeed, precisely because 1.2 million have not returned, there are only two non-Serb deputies from the RS, far from enough to unblock obstruction. Conversely, since a vote from RS is worth double a Federation vote under entity voting, this is a one sided mechanism.
And what has this entity voting been used for? Just in the last two years, it was employed five times to block changes to the Citizenship Law that would permit dual citizenship. Unless these changes, modeled on the European practice, are passed, over half-a-million Bosnian refugees, who fled the country not of their own volition but under the threat of death, stand to lose their native, Bosnia and Herzegovina citizenship.
This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is genocide and ethnic cleansing by other means. The plan calls for eliminating on paper those who could not be eliminated in person. The weapon of choice is entity voting. And this weapon is still there despite the clear language in this Assembly’s resolution 1513 that mandates that entity voting itself be “eliminate[d].”
It is not the implementation of Dayton, but the violation of its core principles, that led to the ethnic apartheid we see today in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We are about to start work on a new Constitution, and allowing this practice to continue will not make that process a successful one. Instead, we will see secretive and pressurized negotiations, resulting in a flawed document. I know because I was there two years ago when the April package of amendments, that the Venice Commission heavily criticized, was offered instead of a meaningful constitutional reform. You know as well, because you were here at that time, adopting a Report that unequivocally stated that it was the “this [entity] voting system, the insistence on it and its political implications, which is to blame for the failure of the constitutional initiative, not a handful of individual representatives who voted against the [April package].”
It is for these reasons that I ask you to clearly identify the culprits and hold them accountable. Indeed, if Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot end school segregation because Dayton gives it no competencies to do so, where should the finger be pointed? Likewise, if only 22 percent entity-voting deputies block the law on the census, refusing the EUROSTAT-recommended disaggregated data, should the 78 percent majority who voted for the census be equally blamed? Finally, if we do not create a Supreme Court, as you and the Venice Commission tell us we should, is the blocked majority to blame?
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please clearly tell us what the European standards are, and I, for my part, pledge that I will entirely accept those standards. I am certain that I speak for a clear majority of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina here. There are those who say that they would choose an ethnocracy and its institutions over Europe, but should such views be relevant in today’s Europe?
In fact, is today’s Europe substantively different from Europe 60 years ago? Are we now only declaratively in favor of the rule of law, human rights, and democracy, but secretly still harbor respect for brute force? Do we condemn genocide through a verdict of the International Court of Justice but do nothing to eliminate its results? I hope that we are not such a Europe. I hope that we are a Europe in which ICJ judgments are implemented and not left in the archives of that Court. I hope that we are a Europe that realizes that, in the long run, values will always win against short-sighted pragmatic interests.
I could quote the ICJ Judgment to remind you what values are at stake, but, instead, I will quote my good friend Lord Russell-Johnston, whose account of the Srebrenica genocide is almost identical to that of the Court seven years later: “almost ten thousand…husbands, fathers, and sons, some only ten or eleven years old, even babies,… were killed in a five-day-long spree of homicidal madness, committed by the Bosnian Serb troops under the command of Ratko Mladic, an indicted war criminal, who is still at large.”
While we applaud the recent arrest of Radovan Karadzic, the fact remains that some of the institutions that the ICJ Judgment explicitly identified as perpetrators of genocide are still in existence. We also applaud the revision of the indictment against Karadzic, which now includes two counts of genocide, across Bosnia and Herzegovina, and against both Bosniaks and Croats. Finally, considering that the ICJ Judgment is the first and only judgment under the Genocide Convention in history, I hope that this Assembly will consider its implications.
Dear Friends,
We have not forgotten the help we received from many of you, and for that we thank you once again. However, without a comprehensive reform of the Dayton Constitution, little progress will be made, threatening peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. I hope that the monitoring process will continue, and that we can also count on the continued help of the Venice Commission in this regard. Rule of law is important as it regulates an otherwise chaotic world, and we need such regulation more than ever. There must be a notion that justice exists, and people must be able to believe in it.
Finally, I hope that we can count on you to identify those who are committed to Europe of the twenty-first century versus those whose thinking is still dominated by the sixteenth-century ideas of ethnic fiefdoms. Ironically, Bosnia and Herzegovina was for centuries a genuine multi-ethnic society whose unique fiber was almost destroyed through mass slaughter, rapes, torture, abuse, expulsion and plunder at the end of the last century. Helping us reverse the effects of those crimes and to build a modern constitutional state that is true to its multiethnic character will make both Bosnia and Europe a better place."
31883,Speech by Chair person of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina dr Haris Silajdžić on 63th General Assembly of the United Nations,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=31883&langTag=en-US,2008-09-23,"It is an honor to address the sixty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Allow me to express my gratitude to Mr. Srgjan Kerim who ably presided over this body during the preceding year, and to congratulate Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockman, the new President of the General Assembly.
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honor to address the sixty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Allow me to express my gratitude to Mr. Srgjan Kerim who ably presided over this body during the preceding year, and to congratulate Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockman, the new President of the General Assembly.
The first time I stood at this podium was in May 1992, as the Foreign Minister of a newly-independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time, I recounted the unspeakable atrocities that were unfolding in my country. I also warned that, if not stopped, such atrocities would only get worse. In fact, I merely asked that Bosnia and Herzegovina be afforded the right to defend itself, the right guaranteed by the UN Charter.
We know what has happened since. Some in the international community insisted on maintaining the arms embargo imposed by the UN Security Council in 1991, thus adding to the obviously overwhelming military advantage of Milosevic’s regime that was bent on destroying Bosnia and its people. They justified this course by claiming that the lifting of the embargo would add oil to the fire. The result, inevitably, was quelling that fire with the blood of the innocent.
According to the ICRC data, 200,000 people were killed, 12,000 of them children, up to 50,000 women were raped, and 2.2 million were forced to flee their homes. This was a veritable genocide and sociocide. The intent of the perpetrators of this genocide was to forever destroy the unique multi-ethnic fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina through mass slaughter, rapes, torture, abuse, expulsion and plunder. Despite of this, defenders of our country conducted themselves honorably, as demonstrated by the ICTY acquittals of most of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s military leadership.
All this culminated in Srebrenica in July, 1995. The International Court of Justice, in its Judgment of February 26, 2007, ruled that
“[T]he Bosnian Serbs devised and implemented a plan to execute as many as possible of the military aged Bosnian Muslim men present in the enclave…, that the acts committed at Srebrenica…were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly that these were acts of genocide, committed by members of the [Army of Republika Srpska] in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.”
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Through its acts and omissions, the United Nations, by its own admission, bears a part of responsibility for the crimes committed at Srebrenica. In fact, the UN Secretary-General’s Report on Srebrenica from 2000 unequivocally states:
“Through error, misjudgment and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder…Srebrenica crystallized a truth understood only too late by the United Nations and the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a moral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever.”
We do not want the United Nations to be haunted. This organization’s credibility is too important to the world to carry the burden of this failure. Errors can be committed, but errors must not be repeated. We want the UN to right the wrongs. In fact, international law mandates that this must be done. Namely, the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, adopted in this Assembly’s Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, mandate that: “no State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach of a [peremptory norm of general international law],” which clearly includes the crime of genocide and the crimes against humanity, “nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.”
If these principles had been applied, would the institutions identified by the ICJ as perpetrators of genocide still exist? Would vast portions of a country remain ethnically clean? Would over 1 million of refugees and displaced persons remain outside their homes? In short, do these principles allow for the arrest of Karadzic and the simultaneous preservation of the results of his project?
We cannot bring back the dead, but we can give dignity and justice to the survivors. What we say today is not aimed at the past, but at the future, and not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it not only to the victims and survivors, but to the humanity as a whole. The message to the would-be perpetrators of crimes in the name of a twisted ideology should be crystal clear: do not even think about it, your terror will not pay off.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we had the opportunity to make that true by a consistent implementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the aggression, stopped the genocide, and brought peace. These were its major accomplishments, and their value cannot be overemphasized.
Dayton, however, was also intended to reverse the effects of genocide and ethnic cleansing. It had all the necessary elements to do so. Instead, in the words of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, its main provisions have been a victim of: “a systemic, continuing and deliberate practice of the public authorities of Republika Srpska with the goal of preventing the so-called ‘minority’ returns, either through direct participation in violent incidents or through the abdication of responsibility to protect the people from…violent attacks due solely to their ethnic background.”
Dayton never intended such ethnic apartheid to take root in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not the implementation of Dayton, but the violation of its core principles, that led to this result. It would be a grave mistake to recognize this result as lawful and legitimate.
It is the responsibility of this organization to make it right. Just as we should not have been forced to smuggle arms to defend ourselves, we should not be forced to smuggle basic human rights, justice and democracy into Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Without righting this wrong can we genuinely celebrate the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this December. Moreover, can we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Genocide Convention if the first and only judgment of the International Court of Justice on the crime of genocide remains in the archives of that Court?
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Now is the time to right these wrongs. We are about to start work on the new Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the outcome of that process will answer many of these questions.
To those who now seek to legitimize the systemic violations of the Dayton Agreement, we all must say: make no mistake, genocide will not be rewarded.
Rewarding genocide could send a dangerous message throughout the world, and would surely undermine the chances for permanent peace and stability in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. Seekers of justice are not the enemies of peace. They are the guardians of peace.
Certainly, there are those in Bosnia and Herzegovina who would not agree with this, but they are surely not the victims of genocide.
Dear Friends,
We have not forgotten the help we received from many of the countries represented here today. A number of your soldiers, diplomats, aid workers and journalists died in Bosnia and Herzegovina while working to end the aggression, bring peace, ease the suffering, or to make sure the rest of the world knew about it. For that we thank them once again, and renew our sympathies to their families. An even greater number of countries have assisted us in rebuilding our society after the aggression, and we extend our heartfelt gratitude for that as well. Bosnia and Herzegovina still needs your help in this regard, and we hope that we can work together in order to ensure permanent peace and stability in my country.

30994,Address of BiH Presidency Chairman dr Haris Silajdžić on occasion of the 13th anniversary of genocide in Srebrenica,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=30994&langTag=en-US,2008-07-11,"Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire world lag behind in paying respects to the genocide victims and to rise above the evil and the transgressions committed in these areas, while the rest of Europe was living in peace. Although this site and scene constantly disturb us, steps forward are encouraging enabling us to send off those who were killed not for what they had done, but only for what they were.
Families of the genocide victims,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Citizens of Srebrenica,
Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire world lag behind in paying respects to the genocide victims and to rise above the evil and the transgressions committed in these areas, while the rest of Europe was living in peace.
Although this site and scene constantly disturb us, steps forward are encouraging enabling us to send off those who were killed not for what they had done, but only for what they were.
Over the last year, this cemetery has been transformed from the Foundation into the Memorial Center under auspices and protection of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. OHR and particularly the Governments of USA and Great Britain, as well as the International Institute for Missing Persons have helped us in that largely.
I also want to thank the US Government for appointing the Special Representative for Srebrenica and initiating changes of the Election Law that ensured voting in Srebrenica for all living genocide victims regardless of where they might be. The good thing is that registration of voters is going on well and significant steps forward have been made in this field. I hope that all people from Srebrenica would use the opportunity to decide on their destiny at these elections, aiming to rebuild a progressive and multiethnic community in this field.
We also owe gratitude to the Governments of Pakistan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for achieving sustainable return and to all those who in any way contribute to recovery and life of people in these areas.
Bosnia and Herzegovina also owes gratitude to all nongovernmental organizations that unselfishly work on seeking justice for the families of the genocide victims. Many members of these organizations, from various parts of the world, are here today with us, including numerous members of the Peace March.
However, a special place is reserved for the Srebrenica Mothers, who have been fighting tirelessly for justice for thirteen years, and many of them are still searching for their dearest ones. Such associations represent a driving force and a moral compass for all the efforts and actions that I have mentioned.
What I want to underline is that all those who are here today and all those working on the issue of Srebrenica, contribute to the development of culture of remembrance, which is of extreme importance for the generations to come. Because, remembering and teaching prevents repetition.
Dear friends, many of us still find it inexplicable that the genocide in Srebrenica happened while Srebrenica was under protection of the United Nations. In his Report on Srebrenica, the United Nations recognized their fatal mistake, stating the following:
“Trough mistakes, bad decisions and an impossibility of comprehending the evil that stood against us, we failed to fulfill our duty and help to save the people of Srebrenica from the Serbian campaign of mass murder. No one regrets more the missed chances for peace and justice than we do. No one condemns more the failure of the international community to take decisive actions to stop the pain and the war that took so many victims than we do.”
However, if mistakes were made and chances for justice were missed during the summer 1995, the question remains why mistakes and oversights are still being made, especially in relation to the implementation of the Verdict of the International Court of Justice. The recent decision of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to refuse the request of two BiH Presidency Members for implementation of the Verdict is also in discord with this recognition, because the third BiH Presidency Member did not sign the request.
For long, we have witnessed the minimization of what had happened here. Somehow, many people simply could not or would not articulate the word genocide. Now, when we have the Verdict of the highest international judicial instance stating that genocide was committed here, the first and the only verdict of that kind in history, we are witnessing attempts to minimize or even ignore the Verdict.
At a forum of importance for Bosnia and Herzegovina that I had attended, a representative of a European country unpleasantly surprised me with his comment by saying that the Verdict existed, but should remain in the Court’s Archives. It might have been a hasty statement, but it reflects the tendency of some that the Verdict should be treated as stillborn. Such an approach encourages the destructive forces and its consequences are visible today in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the attitude of others towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Everyone should read the Verdict before giving such statements because the Verdict, inter alia, stipulates:
“After occupying Srebrenica in July 1995, the Bosnian Serbs made and implemented a plan to kill as many adult Bosnian Muslim males who were present in the Enclave as possible. The Court decided that the actions were committed in Srebrenica with a specific intention to partly destroy a group of the Bosnian Muslims as such, and the genocide actions were committed by the Republic of Srpska Army. The function of the Republic of Sprska Army officers, including General Mladić, was to act on behalf of the Government of the Bosnian Serbs, especially of the Republic of Srpska; they performed elements of public authority of the Republic of Srpska.”
The experts studying the phenomenon of genocide agree that the possibility of genocide repetition is greater if the consequences of the committed genocide have not been adequately treated in the way defined by the international law regulations. Therefore, the Verdict must not remain in the Court’s Archives, but must be adequately implemented. The Verdict is not only of concern to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but to the entire world.
Finally, I remind you that the Verdict also instructs Serbia to arrest all the accuse of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina without delay. The attempts to attribute Serbia’s responsibility to the “reign of Slobodan Milošević” are simply impossible because the post-Milošević power in Serbia has been hiding the accused longer than Milošević himself. Therefore, we expect of Serbia, the first and the only country in history found guilty of violating the Convention on Genocide, to arrest and deliver all those who participated in the genocide project in Bosnia and Herzegovina as soon as possible.
In the end, allow me to close with words of US Congressman Chris Smith, a great fighter for human rights, at the speaker’s stand of the US Congress, while speaking about the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina:
“Justice is a necessary precondition for sustainable reconciliation. Regardless of how long it might take, we must never be tired or discouraged in our quest for justice. Reconciliation and further consolidation of democracy must be based on systematic reform. The perpetrators of genocide would best prefer it if we were to forget. However, that is certainly something we could never do. Ever!”
Without these basic postulates, it is hard to renew the truly multiethnic society, where people live with each other, not next to each other, and which is the only guarantor of peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region. The best example is that such a society is possible in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where people, after all they have been trough, are still ready for coexistence and construction of truly democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear friends, today, the eyes of the world are pointed at Srebrenica and Bosnia and Herzegovina because the past and the future of the entire world are reflected in Srebrenica. Therefore, it is important to validate our determination, not only in words but in actions as well, that justice is still attainable, that policy of genocide cannot achieve political goals and that we can build a victory of peace and coexistence on the example of Srebrenica.
Thank you!"

""Mr. President of the Hellenic Republic,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentleman,
It is my great honor to thank our host the President of the Hellenic Republic, Dr. Karlos Papoulias, for his warm hospitality and excellent organization of this gathering, and especially to greet the UNESCO Director General Koichiro Matcura and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Terry Davis.
I would like to express my satisfaction over the organization of today's meeting which we see as a continuation of a dialogue process at the highest level of the countries of the Southeast European region in the domain of culture and cultural heritage, which was initiated under the patronage of UNESCO in Ohrid in 2003.
A specific geographic position at the crossroads between the East and the West, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, valleys of big rivers such as the Danube and Sava, as well as a very rich and tumultuous history of our region, have made the Southeastern Europe a mosaic of religions, cultures, traditions and languages. Being a historically multiethnic country, Bosnia and Herzegovina considers these diversities to be one of the greatest riches of our region. I fully share the opinion with UNESCO that it is precisely the domain of culture that offers enormous opportunities for the establishment of close cooperation in the Southeast Europe region. In this context, I would like to welcome UNESCO's activities and those of its Director General.
I believe that the joint affirmation and joint promotion of our cultural heritage could be one of the best and most effective ways of creating a better portrait of our region.
In addition to its cultural and historic values, our cultural wealth could also be an important basis for economic and sustainable development.
I also wish to express my pleasure with the fact that a decision was made at the last session of the Committee for Cultural Heritage in Christ Church in New Zealand, on enlisting the Mehmed PaĹˇa SokoloviÄ‡ Bridge in ViĹˇegrad on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This act, combined with the addition of the Mostar Historic Town Centre along with the Old Bridge in 2005, represents a stimulus for our country to step up the restoration and protection of our cultural and natural wealth. Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently nominated another cultural and historic monument to be added to the World Heritage List â€“ namely the Old City of Jajce. We do hope that a positive decision will be made at the 33rd World Heritage Committee. In addition to this we are preparing the nominations of Vjetrenica Caves.
Once more I would like to point out that Bosnia and Herzegovina is interested in nomination for enlisting the National Park of Sutjeska in the World Heritage List, which is a joint project with the National Park Durmitor in the neighboring Montenegro. I believe that this is the best way to permanently preserve the natural wealth of our countries â€“ especially the canyons of rivers Drina and Tara. Allow me to use this opportunity to repeat that BiH is fully committed to respecting the 1972 Convention on World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Furthermore, I would like to point out that Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently ratified the 2005 UNESCO Convention on Protection and Promotion of the Cultural Expressions, and that we are in the process of ratifying the Convention on Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.
Ladies and Gentleman,
Allow me to mention some other projects for promotion of the historic and cultural heritage, which are of a great importance for my country.
I would like to thank UNESCO and the General Director Matcura for the participation in the reconstruction of three symbolic religious objects in our country â€“ the Ferhadija Mosque in Banja Luka, the Orthodox Monastery in Mostar and the Catholic Monastery Plehan in Derventa. The reconstruction of these objects will further improve our efforts to rebuild a multiethnic and multicultural society in Bosnia and Hercegovina , where the cultural diversity is considered to be a part of our wealth and a comparative advantage.
The active participation of UNESCO in the realization of these projects additionally underlines the important role that UNESCO has in the protection of the treasures of our region and the promotion of multiethnic and multicultural society in the very geographic center of Europe.
I would like to thank UNESCO for the support in completing the project ARS AEVI, which is one of the most important European museums of modern art in Sarajevo. Due to this project, Sarajevo and our region have become one of the worldâ€™s leading destinations of modern art.
Ladies and Gentleman,
As you know, Bosnia and Herzegovina has undergone a period of post war recovery and reconstruction. It has been a tough period for our country and our citizens. The country was almost completely destroyed and not only did we have to rebuild the cultural and historic monuments and values but also the trust among people of our region. A special segment of our post war reconstruction was the reconstruction of cultural life, for which we had a strong support of UNESCO and its member states. The experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the view of establishing a cultural dialogue is of a great importance, because we can offer constructive models for culture in the globalized world.
Generally, we all found our societies and cultures near water. It is source of life and all big civilizations have been established on the banks of big rivers. Bosnia and Herzegovina contains in its name the name of one of our six big rivers and its natural borders are rivers Una, Sava and Drina and in the south the Adriatic Sea. Various cultures were founded on these water ways; cultures that have been developing since the neolith. Every great civilization and religion is somehow closely connected to the culture of water. Every cultural part in our region could signify the fact that there are no borders in the nature and that the water connects people by ensuring the existence of all people. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina supports development and intensification of cultural corridors with the aim of establishing a closer connection and ensure the survival of the unity of diversities. Exactly this unity of diversities is the cultural wealth that we have to preserve in the Southeast Europe. I believe that the cultural corridors related to maritime and river routes could be a useful tool for the realization of the intercultural dialogue.
By establishing affirmation and joint promotion of our cultural heritage, we could turn the Southeast Europe region into a destination which, thanks to its cultural wealth and all its diversitiy, would once again attract visitors from the entire world, and in that way open new development perspectives for our countries.
Thus, we send a clear political message of our willingness to constructively include our countries in all international processes and our determination to make the Southeast Europe region an example which proves that good relations and cooperation can be established if they are based on a constant dialogue and plentitude of cultural diversities.
Thank you for your attention."""
30378,Speech by the BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić on the occasion of the BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=30378&langTag=en-US,2008-06-05,"Invaluable contributions and assistance were provided by the tens of thousands of US Government representatives and members of the Armed Forces engaged as part of the international forces for establishing and maintaining peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, humanitarian aid, renewal and reconstruction of this war-torn country.
Excellencies,
generals and officers,
representatives of legislative and executive government, dear guests,
It is an honour to welcome you to today’s event organised on the occasion of 5 June – the Cooperation Day between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United States of America in the domain of international cooperation in defence and security.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank all of you for taking the time to honour this event by your presence, and we owe particular gratitude to the organisers and participants of the spectacular performances by members of the US Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This event today, just like the defence reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina whose results are evident, could not have been achieved without the help of friendly countries, and especially the United States of America.
Invaluable contributions and assistance were provided by the tens of thousands of US Government representatives and members of the Armed Forces engaged as part of the international forces for establishing and maintaining peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, humanitarian aid, renewal and reconstruction of this war-torn country.
Later, this assistance continued through training, equipment and professional advice for the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With the strong support of the United States of America, at the end of 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited to join the NATO Partnership for Peace Programme, and as of April this year, it was also invited to establish Intensive Dialogue with the NATO Alliance with the ultimate aim of full membership.
Due to limited resources, cooperation and assistance will continue to play a significant role in the professional development and modernisation of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to these goals and expects that through engagement within the NATO and other programmes and initiatives, the United States of America will remain its most significant strategic partner in the domain of defence.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will also continue to strengthen cooperation and friendly relations will all interested countries from its surroundings, members of NATO, the Partnership for Peace and other countries from the region.
Accession to the European Union and NATO remain the main priority in activities at all levels.
In view of its geo-strategic position and overall characteristics, Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important factor for the stability of the Southeast European region. It will, therefore, strive to provide its utmost contribution to improving the total relations and cooperation between countries in the region.
NATO’s engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is of crucial importance for establishing and maintaining peace in the post-Dayton period. That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina will participate in all the activities of the NATO Initiative for Southeast Europe aimed at harmonising and supporting regional cooperation in matters of defence, as well as in concrete projects.
Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to develop the capabilities of its Armed Forces for participation in peace support operations.
As a member of the Partnership for Peace and an aspiring candidate for full NATO membership, Bosnia and Herzegovina requires NATO’s assistance in surveying its existing capacities, equipment and capabilities for participating in peace missions.
As proof of cooperation with the United States of America, through the Implementation Agreement that will be signed today, the United States of America will provide additional education and training for the Armed Forces of BiH within the IMET programme amounting to one million dollars. This is a continuation of the programme that trained over 150 members of the former entity armies in the past.
Dear guests, the reform of the defence system in Bosnia and Herzegovina was an important step towards full NATO membership, and it was all done with the support of friendly countries, and especially the United States of America. We expect to receive support up to the moment of full NATO membership when Bosnia and Herzegovina will become an active participant and give its contribution to regional and global security.
Finally, I would like to thank all of you once more for being here today, and I hope we will make this event a tradition."
30011,BiH Presidency Member from the Republic of Srpska Nebojša Radmanović’s address on occasion the celebration of the Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment “Republic of Srpska”,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=30011&langTag=en-US,2008-05-12,"We have traditionally gathered here today at this spot to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the Republic of Srpska Army’s establishment and the 3rd anniversary of the Third Infantry Regiment (Republic of Srpska) within the reformed BiH Armed Forces. On that occasion, I congratulate those who deserve these congratulations....
“Gentlemen presidents
Of the Republic of Srpska, the National Assembly and the Government of the Republic of Srpska,
Your excellencies,
Gentlemen generals, officers and soldiers,
Esteemed families of the killed and missing soldiers of the Republic of Srpska Army,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have traditionally gathered here today at this spot to celebrate the 16th anniversary of the Republic of Srpska Army’s establishment and the 3rd anniversary of the Third Infantry Regiment (Republic of Srpska) within the reformed BiH Armed Forces. On that occasion, I congratulate those who deserve these congratulations:
All the members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment “Republic of Srpska”;
All the members of the Republic of Srpska Army,
I would also like to express our gratitude and respect to the
Families of the killed, missing and wounded soldiers of the Republic of Srpska Army in the past war,
On the day of the Republic of Srpska Army, remembrance of the recent and distant past simply imposes on us.
During the nineties, the common state of the Yugoslavian peoples was destroyed and divided in one of the most brutal wars led in these areas. Just like some earlier times in the past, during those years, various dangers threatened the Serbian people and their survival, freedom and national identity. In such circumstances, in 1992, the Serbian people in BiH formed the Republic of Srpska Army as an armed force for defending the Serbian people and the territory they inhabited for centuries.
We owe it to the plebiscitary expressed democratic will of the Serbian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Army of the Republic of Srpska that defended the Serbian people and their historical, national, cultural and political values and heritage in an armed fight for the existence of the Republic of Srpska.
The previous war in BiH took many sacrifices on all sides, and in the Serbian people as one of them, and that is why we must not forget that the Republic of Srpska was created with huge efforts, sacrifices and aspirations of the entire Serbian people, especially the RS Army members. The war in BiH, just as any other war, left behind heavy trauma in the hearts of people that had lost their closest members, members of their immediate family or distant relatives. That obligates us to take a better care of the invalids and wounded soldiers, families of the killed and missing soldiers of the Republic of Srpska Army in the past war. The Republic of Srpska National Assembly would soon consider the reviews and amendments to the Law on rights of soldiers, disabled war veterans and families of killed soldiers of the defensive and patriotic war, which will ensure an increase in the monthly income of the disabled war veterans and families of the killed soldiers. For the first time, the rights of these categories have sound financial guarantee trough regular monthly payment.
In the post-war period, the Army and the Republic of Srpska institutions significantly contributed to implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, preservation of peace and building trust and cooperation between the sides in the conflict, as well as defense sector reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Within the general process of military and defense sector reform toward the Euro-Atlantic integration, since our last gathering at this very spot, just in a year, several important activities in this domain have been conducted.
At the last NATO Alliance Summit in Bucharest this year, relations between the BiH Armed Forces and the NATO Alliance have been elevated to the Intensified Dialogue level, which is recognition of the successfully completed reforms in the previous period.
The Agreement on the final ownership of the rights and obligations on movable property that would continue to be used for the BiH defense purposes has recently been signed, which is a significant progress in solving this complex and sensitive matter.
Activities on establishing the BiH military mission at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels are underway.
Additionally, preparations for sending military attachés to three BIH diplomatic and consular missions in Serbia, Croatia and Turkey are in the final phase.
The process of accepting first 300 soldiers for professional service in the BiH Armed Forces has commenced.
BiH Armed Forces units, soldiers and officers from the Republic of Srpska among them, are successfully participating in several peace missions in the world within the UN engagement in the collective security system in the world.
We celebrate the Republic of Srpska Army Day and the 3rd Infantry Regiment Republic of Srpska immediately after the great holidays, May 9, the Day of Victory over Fascism and the Day of Europe. Serbs and the members of other nations in BiH have given their enormous contribution to the Antifascist fight during the Second World War, for which they deserve an honorary place among other nations of Europe and the world. That is something that we must not forget, for the sake of the truth, as well as for future generations in the united Europe.
We build today’s BiH as a community of equal nations, toward the EU membership. Unfortunately, there are those at high places in BiH that contest the equality and still believe that they can decide on others’ rights and way of life. We say to them that it is not possible in a modern society, contesting one’s rights on equality mostly harms one’s own people and sets him farther from others, from the united Europe to which we aspire.
In the end, I wish the 3rd Infantry Regiment Republic of Srpska and the entire armed forces of BiH to serve for peace, security and stability of the region. That is the only way to ensure that the heavy war past never happens again.
Thank you.”"
29888,BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić has addressed today the participants of the 15th Summit of the Heads of States in Ohrid,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=29888&langTag=en-US,2008-05-03,"“The solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region called west Balkan is the European Union and there is no other alternative to it.

“The solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region called west Balkan is the European Union and there is no other alternative to it. We need security, therefore the biggest interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to be in good terms with its neighbors all heading toward the European Union” said BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić in his address. According to his words, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a part of the solution because it can contribute to constructive dialogue. Multi-culture and pluralism are the solution for the countries that have bitter experience like Bosnia and Herzegovina - said Chairman Silajdžić.
He emphasized that Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens want to be integrated in the European Union and NATO and there is no doubt about it. “BiH did not sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement event though we had met all requirements, believing that reform process is very important and that we were not racing with time. The crucial issue is not whether we would sign the Agreement this month or the next one, but that there is a sense of resentment and bitterness”, said Chairman Silajdžić. He stressed out that Serbia did sign the Agreement, even though the International Court of Justice confirmed with its verdict that the country was responsible for the genocide in BiH. According to his words, the Court’s decision was being ignored and he asked the Summit participants what they would have done if that were happening in their countries. He underlined that he was an optimist believing in Europe as a solution for BiH, offering BiH’s experience to Europe, success and failure altogether.
During his address, Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić said Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country that can produce energy and in that way make its contribution to the European Union."
29779,BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić’s speech on occasion of celebrating the Battle at the Neretva river,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=29779&langTag=en-US,2008-04-26,"Fellow fighters, I know you have a hard time, you are in pain because of the negligence of the present authorities, and what is worse, certain people that are proud of their Chetnik or Ustashi descend and their ideology are holding, or used to hold, important positions in this state.

“Dear comrades,
Ladies and Gentlemen, antifascists, partisans,
It is my honor to be standing here today, at this glorious part of the BiH land, to be able to invite the memory of the brave and honorable heroes who did their best to save their fellow soldiers, their comrades, from the claws of the Fascist criminals and their domestic collaborators, the Chetniks and the Ustashi.
There are many told stories, many memories, but unfortunately, there is more and more looking down on the significance of the War of National Liberation, the heroic and honorable battle fought by all people in our former common State.
We must not forget and we must not allow the heroic battles, such as this one, to be forgotten or even worse, we must not allow the distortion and the falsification of the character of the entire fight against the Fascists and local collaborators.
The fourth enemy offensive, or Vol Weis as the Fascists called it, was initiated for the purpose of destroying the headquarters of the War of National Liberation, the majority of the partisan forces and what is worst, the main partisan hospital. The offensive was supposed to strengthen the Fascist creation definitely, the Independent State of Croatia, the position of the criminal Chetnik “patriotic” soldiers and the Fascist German and Italian occupation troops.
The Fascists did not count on your faith in victory; therefore, none of the combat tasks represented any unsolvable problem for the partisan units.
They personally experienced it, especially the Chetnik formations, which seized to exist after this battle as a military factor and were only what they were actually from the beginning – criminals perpetrating crimes against the helpless and innocent civilian population.
Certain parallels could be drawn with the war conflict that unfortunately took place in our more recent history. That war again brought back the domestic Fascists who committed horrible transgressions, war crimes and genocide.
That shows that fight is not over yet and breaking their forces that happened here in 1943, was not final.
Therefore, we must never stop and become discouraged, for our future and for the future of our children and those that are yet to come.
Fellow fighters, I know you have a hard time, you are in pain because of the negligence of the present authorities, and what is worse, certain people that are proud of their Chetnik or Ustashi descend and their ideology are holding, or used to hold, important positions in this state.
However, you must know that there are also those that would never give up, those who consider Bosnia and Herzegovina their only homeland, we are determined to fight for it, because Bosnia and Herzegovina is ours, it belongs to all of us, the Bosniacs, the Serbs, the Croats, the Jews, the Roma, and the others, it belongs to all its citizens, it is our country, every part of its territory, regardless of the name we wear, the God we pray, no matter if we are the majority or the minority.
No one, not any people, not any politics, not any individual can or will be an owner of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and certainly not an owner of any of its parts, even the least one!
It belongs to the Bosnians and the Herzegovinians, the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina! Only that Bosnia and Herzegovina, and why not say Bosnia and Herzegovina defined at ZAVNOBIH, is a normal country, the country of future, a happy country!
May 9, the Day of Victory over the Fascism is in a few days! By paying respects to all Antifascists who gave their lives for freedom, I wish to emphasize again that Antifascism is our historic legacy, we will proudly take it to the European family that inherited the same values as the basis for the modern democratic world!
May all those who made sacrifices in the fight for freedom against the Fascism have the eternal glory.”

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with every house filled with books testifying about the meetings of civilizations and their bonding trough culture and art.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Excellencies,
Dear authors and book creators, publishers, printers and booksellers,
It is my pleasure to be able to share the joy for holding a jubilee Sarajevo fair, here at the XX International Book Fair in Sarajevo that has brought us together under the symbolic title “Sarajevo, a world book”. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with every house filled with books testifying about the meetings of civilizations and their bonding trough culture and art. The Bosnian house is not cramped for anyone, it has never taken anyone’s living space, it has always been open in the best tradition of our millennium life experience, and in it, we dedicate ourselves to the books in the year declared as the international year of books by the United Nations. We celebrated the Earth Day and we celebrate the World Book and Copyright Protection Day today, a day that UNESCO promotes reminding us about the importance of books and works of authors in our lives.
The capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina- Sarajevo is therefore a natural place for it, where authors, publishers, librarians, booksellers, scientific workers dedicated to the books meet and create. The history of Sarajevo and cultural, historical, artistic, spiritual and natural heritage and contemporary creativity confirm that this is a city that rightfully belongs to the most important regional and world centers of art and culture.
For the Book fair and many other events dedicated to books: “Sarajevo Poetry Days”. European literary meetings of the “Andre Malraux” Center, upon invitation of PEN Center, Writers’ Society, Publishers’ Association, many world authors come in Sarajevo proving the importance of the BiH cultural ambience, in which one could create freely and fully express oneself without any restriction. Bosnia and Herzegovina respects the principles of free expression and free publishing and information in accordance with the UNESCO basic principles, defined in Articles 19-27, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Agreement on importance of education, science and culture (the Florence Agreement).
Sarajevo is a city where is the BiH Academy of Art and Science, the Town’s Archives and of BiH, and the Museum of Theatrical Art and Literature, with one of the most important collections of BiH contemporary worldwide recognized writers, such as Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić, Meša Selimović, Isak Samokovlija, Mak Dizdar, Tin Ujević and others.
This town contains one of the oldest Balkan libraries – Gazi Husrev-Beg Library, established in 1537, as well as the Zemaljski Museum, which in its rich treasury also holds Hagada, created in the period 1350 -1370, as well as many other extraordinary manuscripts. In Sarajevo, there is also the Oriental Institute and other scientific institutions, the Language Institute, Institute of Balkan Studies, the Academy of Arts and all other art academies (music, theatre, fine art)
It is particularly important that in Sarajevo, there are specialized libraries, such as the Library for the blind and those with poor vision.
I personally express my full support to your efforts to create better economic conditions for the development of publishing, bookselling and printing, better status for the authors and greater possibilities for the readers, a better accession to the books. There can be no scientific, research, artistic creation or education in life without books; therefore, on the 20th jubilee meeting in Sarajevo, I support your effort to abolish VAT on books, because that is a tax on mind, tradition, future. I support your efforts to restore the libraries, school and university, to open new public libraries and bookstores throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, to renew the printing technology and bravely enter the Information Era and create better conditions for digitalization and connection with the entire world. We are obligated to support the completion of the Cultural Policy Strategy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, focusing on books and everything related to the books, art, culture, creativity and education. We are obligated to do it for ourselves, for the creators and extreme talents in all fields in our country, and for our commitments toward the Council of Europe, our role in UNESCO, which is not only referring to protection of cultural, historical and natural heritage, but to the entire creativity, our Euro-Atlantic integration and world standards, care for the book and responsibility of the countries for its role in the development of a society. I support your appearance at the impending International Book fair in Podgorica and your appearance at the 60th Frankfurt Book Fair and the initiative for the entire region’s appearance at this unique place in the book world. That way, this southeastern part of Europe would be shown in the best light with its literary and the entire cultural and historic heritage.
I support your efforts to make Sarajevo a world book city, as Amsterdam has been this year, I support Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina becoming the hosts of the World Publishers’ Congress, as Seoul has been this year. I support your initiative for Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the best of its creators by awarding state-level recognitions and awards, valorizing their work, education and affirmation in the country and the world, as well as with full social protection of creators, who have invaluably contributed to our country’s development. I recognize the BiH Association of Publisher and Booksellers for all these initiatives and efforts as a part of the world publishers’ association. I especially recognize the organizers of this XX International Sarajevo Book Fair, KSC Skenderija, co-organizers TKD Šahinpašić and the BiH Association of Publisher and Booksellers, I most cordially greet all participants of the Fair from the country and the world, because this is an event testifying about the value of joint work on book, culture and creativity promotion in connecting the modern world dedicated to development, democracy and new relations.
Thank you.”"
29628,BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić’s address on occasion of the celebration of the 16th anniversary of “Pretis 92” action - remembering Safet Hadžić,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=29628&langTag=en-US,2008-04-18,"It is my pleasure to attend the celebration of the 16th anniversary of the “Pretis 92” action together with you, as well as this program dedicated to brigadier general Safet Hadžić, who died during that action as a regular soldier.
Sarajevo, April 18, 2008
“Dear Hadžić family,
Dear soldiers,
Dear guests,
It is my pleasure to attend the celebration of the 16th anniversary of the “Pretis 92” action together with you, as well as this program dedicated to brigadier general Safet Hadžić, who died during that action as a regular soldier.
Ordinary people, patriots, members of the Patriotic league, Green Berets, Territorial Defense and the RBIH Ministry of Interior, all quickly realized the danger that was threatening our sovereign, independent and an internationally recognized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They were aware of the plan that was devised to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that mass murder, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing and sieges were about to ensue. They were aware that JNA was cleansed from any “unfit element” and a rough and an unequal fight for preservation of our state, its peoples and citizens was about to take place, those peoples and citizens that considered Bosnia and Herzegovina their homeland.
Precisely for those reasons, the “Pretis 92” action was planned and carried out, in the night between April 17 and 18, 1992, aiming to extract armament and military equipment necessary for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s defense.
The action was a success in relation to extracting the armament and the military equipment, however, it was also painful due to the death of the deceased Safet Hadžić, Sead Velić, Nermin Zeljković, Fahrudin Čavčić, Almir Islamović and Senad Čirić.
Safet Hadžić died as a regular soldier, but he was also the President of the Crisis Headquarters of the Sarajevo region at the time of his death. He realized on time the destiny of his country ad his people. Therefore, he was a member of the Patriotic League, he gathered officers that had left JNA and he included them in the Sarajevo region Crisis Headquarters. He had a large number of patriotic friends, his informal operative headquarters where they made plans for defending Sarajevo.
General Safet directly planned and participated in the “Pretis 92” action with his friends-fellow soldiers, when he died bravely and honorably on April 18, 1992 at the time of the “Pretis”.
Hero Safet, and all other patriots that gave their lives and health for the independent and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina, we owe it you to preserve stability, democracy, economically stabile state and the integrity of our Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We owe it to them, especially their families, their children, who must have their future safe and secured. We must all be proud of the fight that was led by our soldiers, their families can walk proudly, and their closest ones have deserved it with their honorable fight, because they did not answer to savagery with savagery, destruction and mass murder. They just defended their country and their people.
We must remember General Safet and all killed soldiers, patriots and their families every day, we must celebrate anniversaries, defend their deeds from oblivion, proudly mention their names and the important battles, because that is our duty and an our obligation.
In the end, I wish to mention the first President of the RBiH Presidency, the deceased Alija Izetbegović, who also always had special words of respect and love to say about the soldiers. He always emphasized that politics can achieve only as much as the soldiers have ensured it the field."
29260,BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić’s address on occasion of laying a cornerstone for the new US Embassy building in BiH,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=29260&langTag=en-US,2008-03-26,"It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency at this festivity, and to wish you a successful construction of the new United States of America Embassy building in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
“Dear Excellencies, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency at this festivity, and to wish you a successful construction of the new United States of America Embassy building in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The United States, with its continuous presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, since the hardest days in our history, showed significant support to our country, its progress and preservation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Its building symbolizes the continuation of the United States’ interest in development and strengthening of bilateral relations between our two countries.
The close relationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United States of America has existed since the very independence of our country. The United States were among the first to recognize the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on April 7, 1992.
The diplomatic relations were established on August 6, 1992, and the United States Embassy began with work on November 10, 1993 within the US Embassy in Vienna. The first Embassy of the United States of America in Sarajevo was opened in July 4, 1994, on occasion of celebrating the 218th anniversary of USA independence, during the most difficult times.
Madeleine Albright, the US Ambassador to the United Nations at the time and a friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina attended the ceremony. Besides sending her support to the citizens of the surrounded Sarajevo during that visit to Sarajevo with words “Ja sam Sarajka”, Ambassador Albright envisaged the future relations between our two countries, by saying “Your future and the future of the United States of America are inseparable.”
14 years later, her words are even more significant, because the Unites States of America have been, continuously and with an equal intensity, supporting the development of democratic values, human rights and rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our two countries’ experience is also tightly connected. Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as citizens of USA, are appreciating and believing in the advantages of the multiethnic society, and they are guided by an idea of coexistence, mutual respect and tolerance. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been based on these ideas and values for hundreds of years, and the recent past experience only emphasized the importance of supporting and defending these values. In that sense, the help from the United States that naturally understand the advantages of those values is of crucial importance for further development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a functional, multiethnic democracy.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is trying to return the help the United States are extending to our country, and is becoming more and more important partner of USA in the series of fields. Our two country’s soldiers are helping to preserve peace in several missions worldwide, and Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress toward the NATO Alliance membership represents a symbol of our country’s determination and its citizens to have as closer cooperation as possible with the United States in our joint efforts for peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in the Balkan and Europe in general.
The mutual relations between our two countries are better and better over the years. Political and strategic cooperation has always been present and at the very high level, and economic and cultural cooperation is getting more and more stronger, therefore I hope that business relations would be more intensified, especially by the American corporations’ investments in projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I use this opportunity to thank the United States on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, and to thank for the determination to continue with an active engagement in our country. Besides thanking the current Ambassador, H.E. English, we also owe gratitude to previous six US Ambassadors who performed their duty in our country, and the first one among them has survived grenades and other dangers on a daily basis together with the citizens of Sarajevo. We owe a special gratitude to the United States for stopping further destruction and death in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that is something we will never forget.
Now, allow me to express a deep gratitude to Robert Frasure, Joseph Kruzel and Nelson Drew, who gave their lives to give peace to us. I wish to say to their families – we will always remember your loss and their sacrifice.
In the end, Your Excellency, allow me to express my gratitude by laying the cornerstone, and my hope that you will have a successful construction of the new United States of America Embassy building in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The today’s ceremony and the new building are the best ways to symbolize the friendship between our two countries and the continuation of good bilateral relations and strong cooperation in a series of fields.”"
29235,BiH Presidency Chairman Dr Haris Silajdžić’s address,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=29235&langTag=en-US,2008-03-25,"Reception on occasion of registration of Mehmed–Pasha Sokolović’s bridge in the UNESCO World Heritage List
“Dear Mister General Director Matsuura,
Excellencies, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
It is my honor to greet you on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency and to welcome you. It is a pleasure to host the General Director of UNESCO, an organization that promotes and encourages education, science and art trough preservation of variety of the world’s cultural diversity.
Preserving unity in diversity, on which uniqueness and inimitability of the BiH culture are based on, we primarily consider it as our own responsibility. However, after the systematic destruction of the BiH unity in diversity at the end of the twentieth century, when UNESCO had stressed out the proclamation of that principle as a goal of the humankind’s desirable structure, we rightfully reiterate that we expect UNESCO’s multiple help for renovation, strengthening and preservation of that unity in its variety in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
For all previous cooperation and professional engagement of officials and employees of UNESCO, on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency, I pay respect to you and I thank you for supporting the projects we are trying to carry out in the field of heritage, science, culture and art.
We proudly present our country’s heritage as a bridge between the East and the West, between the North and the South. Mehmed-Pasha Sokolović’s bridge, a work of Mimar Sinan, a court architect and the head builder of the Great Turkish Empire in the 16th century, a monument to the historic ties in the Balkan between the Christian and the Islam cultural world, the economic ties between the West and the East. The bridge in Višegrad is an architectural achievement of the classic Turkish style, and its artistic values are an important phase in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe and humankind. By preserving these values of the past, we are paying respects to our presence and we are building bridges of understanding and intercultural dialogue. Bosnia and Herzegovina is known for its bridges. Three years ago, the Old Bridge in Mostar was the first historic and cultural monument in our country registered in the World Heritage List.
Therefore, I stress out as a symbolic important fact – in the mosaic of universal and permanent values of the world heritage, Bosnia and Herzegovina is represented with the two rocks; architecturally brave, artistically and historically thrilling bridges –both from the 16th century. In the architecture and the history of the Old Bridge in Mostar, a structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been reflected – this is an amazing country; what was impossible to join in other parts of the world, has been joined in it for centuries. Like the MostarBridge, the structure of this country was destroyed in the late twentieth century. Just as the Old Bridge was heroically reconstructed as a symbol of victory of building over destruction, beauty over hatred, Bosnia and Herzegovina is going trough a complex process of reestablishing its structure. From the fragments that it had collapsed into, we are trying to rebuild it as a testimony of permanence of bridges between people.
Dear Mr. Matsuura, the Old Bridge in Mostar is not threatened and I ask of you to pass on that truth and by doing so, ensure additional help to our heritage. The Old Bridge, as well as the entire historic centre of Mostar, has recently been turned into the most shameful world ruins – impoverished and devastated. In a society that is still faced with the tackling of the consequences of physical and internal devastation, the Old Bridge reconstruction was only possible with a help of the world, especially the UNESCO, as a key organization for preservation of cultural diversity.
Our need for your assistance, dear Mr. Matsuura, is not slight, not even in the conditions when facing the task of harmonizing the need to reduce poverty with development in the part of Mostar that was terribly devastated and ensure the implementation of standards set in the Convention on World Heritage
Construction of the Ruža hotel in Mostar is a great investment, significant for the city’s development, which has been stopped in full for over two years, because, in compliance with the decision of the World Heritage Committee, we are trying to find a solution that will harmonize development and heritage. I reiterate – the construction of the Ruža hotel does not threaten the Old Bridge, because the construction has been stopped and will be continued only when the UNESCO experts confirm the hotel’s architecture compliance with the unique and universal value of the Mostar historic centre. On behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency, I repeat our request for UNESCO’s assistance to Mostar until the solution is achieved. I repeat our request now for the UNESCO experts to give their view on the new solution, before the 32nd session of the Committee, so we could continue with our work.
A bridge, as a means to ensure a crossing from one side to another, is one of the most famous symbols. A bridge symbolizes a crossing from the world of human imperfection to the world of openness and merger. That, at the level of higher symbols, is a crossing from earth to heaven, from transience to immortality. Today, our attention is again turned to the Mehmed-Pasha Sokolović’s bridge in Višegrad, which was registered in the World Heritage List at the 31st session of the World Heritage Committee.
That eleven-arch construction ensured the world of remembrance for: its founder Bosnian - a grand vizier three emperors, Mehmed-Pasha Sokolović; its builder – a great name of the world architecture, Mimar Sinan; its chronicler, a writer of a novel on the bridge, who received a Nobel prize – Ivo Andrić, as well as numerous other known and unknown men who had build it, lived beside it for five centuries, walked over it or drew their inspiration from it.
I invite you also to register the names of 3000 people from Višegrad, with a special respect, in the world of universal recollection of humankind, among them 121 children, who were tortured or killed on that bridge or in its vicinity in 1992. The people from Višegrad who survived, witnessing that part of the history of Mehmed-Pasha Sokolović’s bridge, deserve our respect, and their pain – our compassion. More than that, when we celebrate the beauty and the glory of the bridge that is undoubtedly the world heritage, we are obligated to express our determination to recover the bodies of the dead, to punish the perpetrators of the crimes, and to ensure the memory of the victims dignifiedly. On that path, we need the United Nations’ support, so that a bridge could be on the World Heritage List connecting people, taking us to the future after facing the past.
Only that way, dear friends, full symbolism of the bridge and full symbolism of the world heritage syntagm could be fulfilled. The bridge in Mostar and the bridge in Višegrad, trough the catharsis of their today’s custodians, those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, can be preserved forever as universal symbols of good and permanent ties between people and human communities.
This is an opportunity to congratulate on that possibility to all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all citizens of the world, a possibility contained in the today’s formal act of confirmation presentation that The Bridge on the river Drina is a world heritage.
Dear Mr. Matsuura, thank you for the UNESCO’s support. In the end, allow me to wish you a nice stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

""Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests and friends…
Allow me to thank you for joining us in this celebration of an extremely important day for us in the recent history of BiH, the BiH Independence day. For us, this day is inscribed in golden letters in a thousand-year long history of BiH, because on that day, 01.02.1992, we held a referendum on independence of the state of BiH. Based on those results, and bearing in mind the developments in the field, the European Union Council of Ministers, on 06.04.1992, in Brussels, reached the decision on the international recognition of the Republic of BiH.
That is how BiH’s historic walk on fire began as a sovereign and an independent country, founded in the most difficult war conditions and on an unbreakable and clearly expressed will of its citizens and peoples to live on their own, together with all those that consider BiH their homeland.
Dear guests, I unfortunately must state that regarding the perception of BiH as a shared state, a sense of respect for it has not changed significantly over the last 16 years.
It is clear that everybody draws partial conclusions and only what they need out of this history of ours, so we find ourselves again in the situation when we must vigorously fight to preserve BiH whole and independent and responsible in the future as well, and that no one is amnestied for all the bad things one is doing to its homeland.
We must finally comprehend the reality and build our future on it. We remain one country, not an inch of this country soaked in blood will be separated and there will be no more of settling accounts with anyone. We are part of Europe, so let us act like it and let us adjust our way of life, work and respect for European standards in all spheres, from the smallest and the commonest human, educational, cultural, religious, scientific and technological, economic and all others. When we realize it and accept it, there is a great possibility that we would not need any tutorship or this kind of actions by the European Union organs in our country. Then we will be able to talk about the true independence of BiH.
I believe in that and I want the current High Representative and other high officials and Excellencies to realize it and if they want, wish and can, to help us to reach that level of comprehension and action! However, if they do not want, wish or cannot do that, we must do it ourselves! I know it will be hard, but we will succeed!
There is room for all of us. This country is large enough for all and rich enough for all, and above all, it is our homeland, just the way it is and just the way we are and may it have a happy sixteenth anniversary of independence and may it have all following anniversaries even happier, particularly those that our future lies on – our children!
Thank you and cheers!"""
28764,Address by the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojša Radmanović,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=28764&langTag=en-US,2008-02-27,"Meeting of the Political Directors of the PIC Steering Board, Brussels, 26-27 February 2008
""Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today’s meeting of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board is an opportunity to exchange our views on political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and progress of the country in the Euro-Atlantic integration process. Since the last meeting of the Peace Implementation Council, many things have happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina that changed the earlier situation in the country. There are many analyses and various opinions about the achieved progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, I would like to express my attitude on the situation in BH and possible directions of the reform in the future.
Unlike many other regions in the world where the international community is present, BH represents a positive example of the engagement of the international community, seen as the entirety since the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement till today. It is confirmed by many relevant reports of the international organizations, independent institutions and non-governmental associations in the world.
In the last year, BH had some minor deadlocks and political crises on its way to the Euro-Atlantic integration. One of them was caused by imposing the decisions of the High Representative on the way of decision making in the institutions of BH, which led to resignation by the Chairman of the BH Council of Ministers and slowed down the reform processes in the country. In spite of that, the leaders of the political parties reached an agreement and signed the Mostar Declaration on police reform. These days, the BH Parliament has been discussing the laws on police reform, which represents a step forward in fulfillment of the requirements for signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement. Also, the BH Parliament has confirmed the election of the Council of Ministers and adopted the Budget for the BH institutions for the year 2008.
At this moment, the international community should encourage and support all national political players in final fulfillment of the outstanding requirements for signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement. The still existing Euro-optimism should be employed.
We have heard several times from the diplomatic sources in BH, as well as from the EU, that the ambition of the international community for BH is to sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement as soon as possible. When we are in the position to practically do so, we hear from certain international representatives the reasons for stay and extension of the mandate of the OHR in BH. Last year, at the session of the Peace Implementation Council, in this very place, I presented the arguments for closing the OHR.
Here are some more arguments:
So far, there have been several decisions on transformation of the OHR in BH by the international community, and none of them has been fully implemented.
OHR decisions are often inconsistent with the Peace Agreement, or unnecessary, which causes political crises and represents a threat to stability.
OHR presence in BH does not contribute to democracy, but even impedes it. In order for BH to become a sovereign democratic country, it must be released from the influence of the instructions of any office. Management of this country should be in the hands of the democratically elected representatives of the people in BH.
BH would progress much faster without OHR presence and arbitration in the relations between the national political leaders and the parties can complain to. I believe that the politicians in BH would reach agreements more rapidly if they are enabled to do so.
BH is not a sovereign country as long as the OHR exists as such with issuing orders. All the issues of the further BH development may be resolved in partnership relations of the national authorities and the EU institutions in the process of progressing towards its full membership.
On the basis of that, I do believe that the international community should, as soon as possible, reduce its civil engagement in terms of issuing orders in BH and put the responsibility for the future of the country into the hands of the legally elected representatives.
I would like to remind you that, as the result of positive development of the political and security situation in BH, the NATO reduced its forces in BH and diminished its engagement to the Headquarters in Sarajevo. EUFOR has also reduced its forces in BH as the result of the improvement of the situation in the field of security and stabilization.
I have already been told that the OHR would not be closed in June this year, but I do believe that the transformation process of the OHR into the Office of the EU Special Representative should be accelerated with determining the exact deadline for transformation within the year 2008.
Thank you!"""

At the today’s session of the Peace Implementation Council, BiH Presidency Member Dr Haris Silajdžić expressed the determination of the majority of citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina to sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement with European Union as soon as possible.
Dr Silajdžić stressed out that there are numerous challenges ahead of BiH that require the continuation of the High Representative’s mandate with full Bonn powers. That will be necessary as long as Bosnia and Herzegovina functions under the Dayton Constitution that allows a series of blockades. “What we need now is a new constitution that would ensure a more efficient functioning of the state, quicker reform processes and a full implementation of the European plan”. Designating any dates for closing OHR is unnecessary. Instead, we need a clear strategy that would involve issues necessary for a full functioning of the state with “path with no return” criterion in the European Union integration process.
Dr Silajdžić also expressed his concern regarding the attempt to connect certain regional issues, like Kosovo, with Bosnia and Herzegovina. No parallel can be drawn between the change of Kosovo’s status and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The independence, the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina are guaranteed with the United Nations Charter and any attempt to violate them, whether they are coming from outside or within Bosnia and Herzegovina, would not be tolerated.
Dr Silajdžić confirmed that BiH is determined to fulfill its international commitments, including the cooperation with the Hague Tribunal. However, in accordance with the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which celebrated its anniversary yesterday, that confirmed that genocide was committed in BiH, we will insist on the fulfillment of commitments that stem from it. In accordance with the UN General Assembly Resolution 56/83 on commitments of countries to end the situation created by violating the international law peremptory norms, as well as not to recognize the situation or aid the preservation of the situation, Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to implement the mentioned verdict.
Bosnia and Herzegovina must go forward, but on that way, it will need help of the international community. BiH must be a democratic country, where individual, not collective representation will have priority. Respect for human rights must be ensured for all citizens regardless of their ethnic or religious affiliation. Only the multiethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina in all its territory can bring success for domestic and international factors.
At the end of his speech, Dr Silajdžić invited the Peace Implementation Council representatives to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in joining the family of democratic countries and becoming a constructive and respected member of European Union."

I hope that what we think and say would be of use to you and to us!
Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić made a speech at the today’s meeting of the Peace Implementation Council in Brussels given here entirely:
“Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you for the invitation and for the opportunity to address you! Contrary to the previous meeting of the Peace Implementation Council held in Sarajevo, those who organize these session decided that it might be good to hear an opinion of the BiH Presidency Members on some of the most important issues for the country with us at the head! I hope that what we think and say would be of use to you and to us!
I will try to lay my views and opinion in short regarding some of the topics of this PIC session.
I believe that it is a well-know fact the almost all political factors in BiH do not question, in my opinion, one of the most important strategic goals of BiH – becoming an EU member country! Even more importantly, I am also certain that most of the Bosnians and the Herzegovinians, ordinary people, citizens, see Bosnia and Herzegovina in the future as a full-fledged member of EU! Conviction that BiH’s European path simply has no alternative is an important fact in the political life of BiH. That is a fact with an amazing level of consensus in BiH, in politics and among citizens! Therefore, when it comes to the determination level, we in BiH have no dilemmas, contrary to some regional countries, in relation to our country’ s determination toward the EU integration! Of course, the question arises why things go unbearably slow when there is such a degree of agreement; so slow that we are wondering if we are heading toward EU at all! In my opinion, the reasons for such a state can be found in the composition of current authorities in BiH and the unresolved basic political issue in BiH – the issue of our country’s constitutional structure. Current authorities in BiH are made of six political parties, which essentially advocate three different concepts of BiH’s constitutional structure. Since the basic internal political issue - the issue of future constitutional structure - it is quite logical that all political factors in BiH use every political event, development, process, etc. as a possibility to assume and take the best possible position for themselves before the unquestionable issue for BiH – the issue of the country’s constitutional structure! In my opinion, therein lie the reasons for all political and economic problems of the country!
Changes for the better or popularly called – reform processes – are necessary for BiH to continue its European path; a path toward the better life is in a halt phase. The essential issue at this moment is whether these that you and we call reforms, are truly reforms, i.e. are we heading toward the better, toward EU. My opinion is that, except for the defense reform, these are not reforms and the reform process is not underway! I would call them “virtual reforms”, reforms without any content, pure satisfaction of form. I would be very pleased if someone would persuade me that what we call police reform in BiH is a reform, i.e. if someone could answer me a simple question: what is reformed there and what is essentially different and better from what we have now? Of course, the responsibility of domestic politicians and parties goes without saying, but there is also a responsibility of the High Representative who should be the one that supports the European values and standards at all times, in details and generally.
The future of the High Representative’s Office and his role in BiH, in my opinion, is not in question. BiH, unfortunately, still needs OHR with full powers and capacity. There are two kinds of reasons for this opinion of mine. I call them, ultimately conditionally, the internal and the external reasons. The internal reasons can be found in the insufficient state-level institutional power and capacity to assume most of the functions that any structured state possesses; the institutions that are unable to create and lead any reform without assistance or, let us be honest, a certain pressure of the international community. I think that I do not need to explain to you the external reasons, primarily regarding the security and political situation in the region. Attempts to connect other regional issues, in this concrete case – the issue of declaration of independence of Kosovo, with the situation in BiH are not ending. On the contrary, all things prove that they are gaining on intensity. The current High Representative’s passiveness in relation to this matter is inexplicable and impermissible, unless that is a lack of his political will as an individual to react or it is a received political instruction, a directive not to react?! Whatever may be the case, this is a very dangerous situation for BiH that will continue to deepen political and ethnic tension, divide BiH as a state and the BiH society! I belong among those who think it is necessary, even without any previously set time limit, to preserve the OHR institution with full powers and capacity. Without those powers, and more importantly, their utilization, the existence of that office would be pointless. Have not we been witnesses these days that OHR seemed tragicomically helpless expressing his concern and only concern, while the integrity of the country he is authorized and mandated for by the IC is being seriously threatened? To have Bonn powers and not to use them would be as if he did not have them at all! OHR is concerned and yet he has such powers that can, among else, eliminate that “terrible concern” ruling in OHR and return smiles on the worried faces of the High Representative and the employees in his Office, let alone to speak about us – the BiH citizens – and our wish to smile a bit?!
I know that what I have just said will not be crucial when you are making your decisions. I know that while you are making your decision you are guided by your own assessments and primarily, by the interests of the countries you come from, but please allow me to be guided by my own assessments and interests of my country as I see them in my address!
Thank you!”

Dear participants of the International Festival “Sarajevo Winter”, dear friends of culture and art,
It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you on behalf of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency, which is the traditional patron of this magnificent display of the most creative people and top art achievements.
Bosnia and Herzegovina counts its existence from one altogether symbolic document – the Charter of Kulin Ban from 1189, a document, which is not only a state or a trade act, but a charter of freedom of speech, a sing of culture in dealings with others, of removing the barricades, obstacles and borders. Bosnia and Herzegovina has always been a part of Europe and the world and has accepted all positive and open-minded influences. You can see that on every corner of our beautiful country.
Many of us were young people during the student turmoil in 1968, but we also remember that the students and the pupils from Sarajevo, while following an example of their European counterparts, were” realistic and looking for impossible” under the police sticks. Even today, when we boast about our democratic accomplishments in our countries, we must be aware, especially us politicians, that there can never be enough of freedom, that the liberation has not been completed and that there are always barricades to be removed in order to be able to communicate freely.
Therefore, the “Sarajevo Winter” has been good news from Bosnia and Herzegovina for 24 years, and not even the snow or the ice that frequently covers the surrounding hills, could hinder the creative communication with the thousands of artists from worldwide, nor the fog that closes the airport, not even 1479 days of the longest military siege in history. The “Sarajevo Winter” has become a global cultural phenomenon, like no other festival in the world, because of the fact that it has endured all trials believing in art and artists, believing in good.
It is my honor to welcome you to the International Festival “Sarajevo Winter” in Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the European year of intercultural dialogue."
27858,SPEECH BY BIH PRESIDENCY MEMBER DR HARIS SILAJDŽIĆ ON A RECEPTION AT THE PRESIDENCY IN HONOR OF THE UPCOMING HOLIDAYS,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27858&langTag=en-US,2007-12-18,"Ladies and gentelmen, Excellencies,
Dear friends,
It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina reception in honor of the upcoming religious holidays and the New Year.
These holidays present an opportunity to remember where we come from and what preceded the times in which we live. Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country of the „good Bosnians,“ as our neighbors would call us, was mostly a good example of coexistence for hundreds of years. Mutual respect, tolerance for another and for the differences, openness and good neighborly relations were the rule, not an exception. It was not easy to accomplish all that in this region. We were destined to live at a fault-line that more often than not was a meeting point of different peoples, ideologies, religions, interests and everything else that is common to all people, but slightly different between them.
This means that our predecessors invested in coexistence, that they not only tolerated each other, that, under trying times and different regimes, they found a way to provide to themselves and their ancestors a normal life to the extent that, as we sometimes say, the circumstances allowed it. They accomplished this without the aid of the communication mechanisms that we today have at our disposals, without the human rights conventions, without the United Nations and the civil society. They did not dispute the harmony that flows out of the multitudes, the unity of the differences, nor the quality that is produced by pluralism. They did not theorize about the enrichment of the different cultures that meet here in the upward spiral. They did not organize round tables about the expansion of horizons and the benefits of a pluralistic society. They simply lived together and mostly attempted to make their lives easier.
In our times which are the times of uniting, exchange, cooperation, communications, and meetings, this task appears far easier and simpler. Led by the example of those who came before us, we must find a way to turn some defeats into victories and to leave a society and a state that is comfortable to live in to the generations that will come after us.
The human and material resources allow us to do that. If we unite our strengths, our country can become prosperous for all its people in a relatively short time. This means that we can provide everyone with modern education, good health care, employment, and that we can generally have a good living standard.
We finally came to a time that we can be free in our country regardless of the difficulties that we face. But freedom, above all, means responsibility and duty to respect the freedom and the rights of another. That obliges us to continue to work on establishing the rule of law in the full sense.
The curing of the society as a whole, its security and stability, cannot be accomplished as long as those who are responsible for the crimes in our country are not brought to justice. Unfortunately, some of them today enjoy complete freedom, and even the privileges of working in the security structures, in local and other government bodies.
We owe this primarily to the victims of the crimes, to those who defended the freedom and independence of our country and to the generations that are still to come.
Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, dear friends,
It is a promising fact that we were able to meet the requirements for the initialing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union despite our political differences. We will do everything in our power to continue the on the path of integration of our country into the European Union and the NATO alliance. I am certain that our partners in the international community will help us in those aspirations. Our success is their success as well.
Finally, I wish to all of you, as well as all of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to spend the upcoming religious holidays and the New Year in peace and surrounded by your loved ones, neighbors and friends.
Thank you!"

BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s address at the Formal Academy on occasion of the 2nd anniversary of the BiH Armed Forces, Sarajevo, 30.11.2007
“Dear excellencies,
Gentlemen generals, officers and noncommissioned officers,
Gentlemen soldiers,
Dear guests,
Allow me to congratulate you the BiH Armed Forces Day on behalf of the BiH Presidency as well as personally and to wish you all plenty of personal fortune and success in performing such an honorable and a responsible duty.
Today is the second anniversary of the BiH Armed Forces – a common holiday of all of us that consider BiH our homeland, regardless of the Entity we live in, or to which people and religion we belong.
I stress out that the BiH Armed Forces first, in this country, realized and practically carried out the unique and joint action, and that is a fact and the reason for pride of everyone who worked on that goal as well as of the entire BiH.
It in fact speaks about the character of the people who now comprise the BiH Armed Forces or are outside of it, who gave their contribution to their development.
Those people are professionals, in every sense of the word.
Just as many times before, I reiterate that the Armed Forces are the better part of the BiH society, and many of us should follow their example in work and behavior.
The BiH Armed Forces exerted a great effort and restructured their lines, which elevated the level of proficiency to a higher level. For many reasons, thanks to the BiH Armed Forces, our country has become a member of the Partnership for Peace and it is now getting closer to the required standards for the NATO membership.
Worthy representation of our country and fulfilling complex and risky tasks in the peace missions in various parts of the world is a reason for all of us to be proud.
It is commonly forgotten that the engagement and the professional behavior of its members in the peace mission greatly contributes to the reputation of BiH.
These Armed Forces deserve to have their life and work conditions improved in every way and to have the maximum of understanding and support.
In any case, I will stand for elevating the budgetary funds for the Armed Forces to the required level, which is in accordance with the NATO demands.
It is a matter of extreme importance for preservation and improvement of professionalism and human dignity, because the state institutions, with their attitude, even negligence, must not humiliate, in any way, the members of their armed forces and, by doing so, to hold down BiH’s path to a full-fledged NATO membership.
In that sense, I wish you all plenty of that success and I promise you a full support.
Once again, happy holiday and thank you!”"
27515,Address by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić to the representatives of the French Enterprises’ Association,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27515&langTag=en-US,2007-11-28,"I wish to express a great pleasure with the presentation of economic possibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the MEDEF International and to emphasize our determination further to intensify economic relations with the Republic of France.
Pariz, 28.11.2007
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. General Director Montaigne,
I wish to express a great pleasure with the presentation of economic possibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the MEDEF International and to emphasize our determination further to intensify economic relations with the Republic of France.
Our desire is to make this meeting a driving force of the economic cooperation between France and BiH.
The fact that BiH is a NATO Partnership for Peace program member and a potential candidate for entering the European Community, opens the possibilities for starting a new phase of cooperation in the economic filed.
Regardless of the circumstances and the subtlety of our political situation deriving from the complexity of the regional context, the BiH economy is in a constant rise: in 2005 GDP rose by 5.3%, in 2006 by 7.1%. The World Economic Outlook envisages the real GDP rise by 6.0% in next two years.
BiH manages to maintain its macroeconomic stability with economic growth, stable currency and low inflation.
When analyzing our trade exchange, many would be surprised that BiH exports in France more and isn’t that an opportunity for France to “come” in BiH. We are expecting you as businessmen and as tourists as well!
Improving the investment climate and the economic growth results in 4.4 billion EUR of direct foreign investments.
BiH is now offering a favorable legal and investment environment for foreign investments; numerous bilateral agreements is an advantage and human resources our greatest treasure.
We are certain there is plenty of space for intensifying the economic cooperation:
Possibilities for new investments of the French companies in BiH,
Already successful model of joint investments of BiH and French companies for appearance at the third markets,
Cooperation enhancement in the field of tourism.
Very successful ten-year long presence of the IntermarchéGroup in BiH, as well as the arrival of the Lafarge show that BiH can be an attractive destination for the French investments.
Isn’t the time right for a French bank to come in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where big Austrian banks have been working successfully for a longer period, as well as the investors from Germany, Italy, Turkey, countries of the Persian Gulf? In that sense, we welcome the interest of Société Générale in coming in our country.
The food industry is a very attractive sector for the French investment.
We are preparing great infrastructure projects, the BiH highway among them, within the Vc Corridor, which should in the shortest way link the Baltic and the Adriatic Sea.
There are possibilities for increasing the trade exchange volume in both directions. BiH companies’ interest in business with your country is great. Examples are the Aluminija Mostar, the ASA PREVENT Group and our wood industry.
There are also possibilities for cooperation in the field of energy, civil engineering, pharmaceutical and chemical industry and electric engineering.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tourism is also an opportunity for intensifying our cooperation.
I avail myself of this opportunity to thank the French Government for the expertise help in the elaboration of our country’s tourist strategy. Besides the French Government experts, the consortium of French consultants from the renowned companies ORGALIS and BCEOM were engaged in two important projects.
Study on property relations and tourist sector in BiH
Drafting the Business Plan for the Bjelašnice and Igman tourist centre
Your great experience as a tourist superpower will be of great use to the country, which, considering its potentials, aspires to become a preferable destination for the French.
We wish the Accor, Pomagalski or Pierre et Vacance groups’ soon participation in the development of the BiH tourist offer, to which the presence of AIRFrance would significantly contribute.
Gentlemen, we are here for those reasons and we are at your service.
This is also an invitation to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
27457,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s address at the Regional Economic Forum for the South East Europe,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27457&langTag=en-US,2007-11-22,"It is my great pleasure to address the participants of this year’s Regional Economic Forum for the South East Europe, which is held for the fourth time, topic is “Competitors and partners on the path to Europe”.
Ladies and gentlemen!
It is my great pleasure to address the participants of this year’s Regional Economic Forum for the South East Europe, which is held for the fourth time, topic is “Competitors and partners on the path to Europe”.
The presence of such a large number of Heads of States clearly speaks about the importance of the Forum itself and the selected topic.
Professor Zlatko Lagumdžija’s address about the latest Report of the World Economic Forum and the analysis of parallel indicators of competitiveness of the regional countries and the countries in the immediate neighborhood speaks enough about the seriousness of the economic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Unfortunately, I must assert that such economic state is a consequence of the political crisis, which has been, more or less, present since the Dayton Agreement. The crisis has escalated these days with the Bosnia and Herzegovina Council of Ministers Chairman’s resignation and the certain paralysis in both of the Parliament Houses at the state level.
Even though all politicians in our country agree that the road to the European integration is the only true solution, some of them persistently refuse reforms necessary for advancing in that road.
Unified political will, therefore, exists only declaratively, and in reality, it does not allow the implementation of reforms and decisions that are conditions for entering the European Union, with all negative political and economic consequences that are clear to us.
Cooperation with the countries of the South East Europe, for the mentioned reasons, is even more important for Bosnia and Herzegovina and we are very pleased it has been progressing with most of those countries in a satisfactory way, politically and economically.
The fact is that it ranks 104th in the list of 127 countries in the world, in relation to the global competition index, which is a lot worse then the previous two years and we must be seriously upset about it. I am still convinced that we have the potential for a relatively quick progress, economically speaking, if we can first solve the current political crisis.
I am not basing my optimism merely on a wish that Bosnia and Herzegovina would not be a country that the youth wants to leave and where a great part of the population lives in poverty, but also on the recent assessments and prognoses of the European Commission, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
I will cite a few economic indicators on which at least moderate optimism of these prominent international institutions is based.
When it comes to the macroeconomic stability, several indicators are showing progress. GDP in 2006 was 6.2%, and 4.3% the previous year, which was a consequence of the growing domestic demand and the significant export increase. A significant contribution to it was provided from the industrial production and civil engineering, which is encouraging. The total export increased by 29% in relation to the year before and reduced our trade balance.
Direct foreign investments, so needed in our country, have significantly increased, in that way increasing the foreign exchange reserves by 25%. The foreign debt of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been reduced from 26% of GDP in 2005 to 21% in 2006.
The improved total macroeconomic indicators in 2006 also resulted in improving all indicators that depend on macroeconomic stability. For example, savings of the population have significantly increased reaching the level of 4.8 billion KM.
The financial sector development, in banking and other financial services as well, was significant in 2006. This especially refers to the leasing and the insurance services, as well as the micro credit sector reaching 2.5% of GDP.
Optimism can also be noticed in the human resources development, so important for gaining competitive advantages in the foreign markets. The Framework Law on the state-level higher education has been made, and the implementation of reforms in accordance with the Bologna Declaration should bring about higher successfulness and faster graduation of students at universities.
The export and industrial production structure, which was unfavorable for a long time after the war due to the domination of the products of lower phases of processing, is now gradually improving toward the products of higher phases of processing.
We are encouraged that small and medium enterprises in the private sector increasingly show dynamic growth, in spite of the still unfavorable overall business environment in our country. The total support to this business sector, which generates most of new jobs, has been improved in both entities, i.e. the Republic of Srpska and the Federation, even though it still has not been coordinated at the state-level.
Positive characteristics of the Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy should include the fact that we are a small open economy with the total trade exchange of 103% of our GDP. That is encouraging and increases the chances for economic cooperation with the countries of the South East European region, especially after our signing the CEFTA Agreement.
The European Union is still our most important trade partner participating with almost 70% in export from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and around 60% in import.
BDP per capita in our country, corrected for the purchasing power index, has reached around 30% of the European Union’s average.
Ladies and gentlemen, the mentioned positive facts about the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which exist despite the political situation and the unfavorable business environment, are not intended, on my part, to hide an extremely bad place in the rank order of countries monitored by the World Economic Forum, or our other objective and subjective weaknesses.
On the contrary, this address of mine at the today’s Regional Economic Forum for the South East is intended to motivate you all for cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina as a partner and a competitor on the way to Europe.
Thank you."
27364,BiH Presidency Member Dr. Haris Silajdžić’s speech on reception on the occasion of celebration of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27364&langTag=en-US,2007-11-20,"It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to the reception in honor of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ladies and gentlemen, respected excellencies,
dear friends
It is my distinct pleasure to welcome you to the reception in honor of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sixty-seven years ago, on November 25, 1943 in Mrkonjic Grad, the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed at the First Assembly of the Anti-fascist Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH). Four days later, on November 29, in Jajce, at the Second Assembly of the Anti-fascist Council of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the will of its political representatives, entered the former Federative People’s Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ) as one of its six federal units.
The importance of this date was especially confirmed in the struggle against the aggression between 1992 and 1995. ZAVNOBIH confirmed the statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its medieval borders, which are among the oldest boundaries in Europe. As a result, today’s generation owes a great debt to our predecessors who, during World War II, preserved the integrity of the medieval Bosnian state in their heroic and just struggle against fascism. Through their resistance and bravery, the patriots of our country stayed on top of this honorable tradition, and were able to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These historical facts are undisputable because ZAVNOBiH is the deed and legacy of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which fully confirmed the historical and political individuality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a multireligious, multiethnic, and multicultural state of the Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and others.
I am sadened that with us tonight are not all of the represetantives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is those who do not recognize this holiday because they believe that the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state begins in Dayton. The Dayton Agreement ended the war and confirmed the already existing statehood and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the first Article of that Agreement clearly states that Bosnia and Herzegovina shall continue its legal existence under international law as a state.“ Anex II of that Agreement emphasizes that „[a]ll laws…in effect within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina when the Constitution enters into force shall remain in effect…until otherwise determined by a competent governmental body of Bosnia and Herzegovina.” As a result, Bosnia and Herzegovina does have the Law on state holidays back from its republic days, and November 25 is the BiH Statehood day under that Law.
I hope that over time all representatives of this country will recognize these undisputable historical facts, including this date as the Statehood day of our common country. The representatives of the Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats and other citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina behaved in such a manner, united in the anti-fascist movement, through their adoption of a political decision that paved the way to organize their country according to their will and interests based on the results of the armed struggle of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After forty-seven years of peace on the basis of that struggle, Bosnia and Herzegovina faced an attack by a new wave of facism and extreme nationalism, that had as its goal not only the destruction of the Bosnia and Herzegovina statehood, but of an entire people as well. Milosevic's Serbia, together with the political representatives and the military, paramilitary, and police forces of the then self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, attacked with all available might the Bosnian cities and tows, holding the capital Sarajevo under siege for 1,300 days, which is the longest siege of a city in modern military history. Forcible removal of population, killings of civilians and concentration camp were orchestrated. The entire organized campaign ended with the most gruesome crime of all – the crime of genocide.
Despite the overwhelming advantage of the aggressor, the patriots of this country of all nationalities rose to the defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina, unarmed, but ready to defend their homeland and its people. From the very start, this was an uneven struggle, because the aggressor had every weapon available, while the defenders were forced to smuggle even the basic military equipment due to the international arms embargo.
Under these circumstances, the best sons of this country died defending it. This is an oportunity to remember them with the feeling of indebtness and gratitude. We owe our thanks to them because facism did not prevail, because nationalism and one-mindedness do not prevail in Bosnia and Herzegovina of today, and because we can still argue for an exit out of the political crisis for the life of all our people in a stable, democratic, functional and economically developed coutry. To them we also owe the preservation of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peace that all of them fought for, so that the future of their loved ones will be brigter from the recent past.
We have much to do in all these fields. In the last twelve years, some strides were made in the fields of monetary and tax policy, as well as defense policy and some other fields, but all this is not sufficient to allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to be a functional state and to undertake all necessary reforms for the entry into the European Union. Today there is almost no relevant political option within Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the representatives of the international community, that does not believe that the Dayton Constitution must be changed. This period is ahead of us, but in the meantime we must do all in our power to ensure that the Dayton Constitution, as long as it is in force, is fully implemented. The Dayton Constitution, as any other constitutuion, is respected through its full implementation, and not through empty and politically motivated declarations.
On this road, Bosnia and Herzegovina direly needs the help of the international community. With this in mind, the continuation of the OHR mission and the foreign troop presence is necessary, and we especially welcome the today's decision on the extension of the mandate of the EU Police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to the active presence and participation of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the people of this country must receive motivation from Brussels. Instated of a strong support of the European Union at the time of a political crisis, Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered a disappointment due to the European Commission's decision to allow Serbia to initial the SAA, while postponing a similar move with respect to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
While Bosnia and Herzegovina completely respects the right of the European Commission to independently decide whether to continue the talks with another State, it is critical to note that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a legitimate stake and interest in this matter. On February 26 this year, in a dispute between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, the International Court of Justice found Serbia responsible for violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (the Genocide Convention) on three counts, holding that Serbia has violated the Convention by, inter alia, failing to prevent genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina and for failing to arrest and transfer to the ICTY the persons accused of the crime of genocide. With respect to the ordered measures, the Court ruled that Serbia must immediately arrest and transfer to the ICTY the individuals in question. Needless to say, Serbia has ignored the Court’s order, thereby continuing to violate its international obligations towards Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Genocide Convention.
Considering these international obligations, and in light of the previous unequivocal European Commission’s pronouncements, we can only understand the Commission’s decision as having been influenced by the impending resolution of the Kosovo status. Such strategy, however, does not promise results, as history has demonstrated that an appeasement of the nationalist forces in Serbia in one field has never occasioned a positive resolution of another matter. More importantly, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are distressed over the fact that the Commission has effectively embraced a country that continues to violate the most important international obligations toward another prospective member State. Equaling of the blame for the failure of police reform could have been at one point understood as a temporary political need, but time has demonstrated that such strategy brings no results either. The time has come to finally call things by their true name.
The European Commission has refused to proceed with the initialing of the SAA with Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the fact that the police reform has not yet been carried out by Bosnia and Herzegovina. For years, we have witnessed the obstruction of all attempts to usher in police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina, starting with the Martens plan, and continuing with the plan of the Police Reform Directorate. All of these plans were put forward by the European Union institutions and all of them have been rejected by the leadership of the Republika Srpska entity. While it was clear from the start that Serbia played an important role in encouraging such obstruction, the recent pronouncements by both the President and the Prime Minister of Serbia have offered solid proof of this fact.
I, hence, avail myself of this opportunity to clearly state that this is not 1992, that this time the radical forces in Belgrade are not able to transform their wishes into actual deeds, and that it is high time that Serbia turns to solving its own problems, but also to the fulfillment of a number of international obligations that it still has towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering, however, that Belgrade has already managed to create a certain level of political crisis, there is a danger of individual excesses, which is proven by the recent armed attack near Banja Luka on Mr. Murat Tahirovic. The international community, hence, is aware that it needs to double its efforts in order to prevent the continued importation of this manufactured political crisis into Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to especially protect the returnee population in the RS entity. Such an engagement is the only way to ensure the full stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its progress toward Euro-Atlantic integrations.
There are indications that the international community is aware of this obligation and responsibility, and I therefore view the meeting of the presidents of political parties in two days in Sarajevo with optimism. I believe that the Mostar Declaration opens the possibilities for the return of the country onto the European path, and that we must continue to work on this. We need to continue the dialogue, with the goal of overcoming this manufactured political crises in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the final goal of a democratic, functional and modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, a member of the EU and NATO, and based on the strong legacy of the anti-fascist struggle of all its peoples and citizens.
Once again, I wish you a sincere welcome, and I thank you for honoring the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina by your presence here."

ZAVNOBiH counselors,
Your excellencies,
Comrades,
ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends,
esteemed guests,
dear citizens,
On November 25, 1943, in Mrkonjić Grad, right in the middle of the subjugated Europe, for the first time in the BiH history, representatives of all its peoples met and made a political decision that represented a turning point in the history of BiH, laying a foundation for a modern and democratic BiH.
In Mrkonjić Grad, based on the principles of Antifascism, a historic turning point of bringing Bosnia and Herzegovina to all its peoples was made.
ZAVNOBiH was a session of the Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Antifascists comprising the members of all its peoples.
Dear friends,
At this moment, there are still those who favor the ideologies that did not recognize BiH, just as they do not recognize it now. Today, just like in the World War II, those that favor certain ideologies are claiming BiH exclusively for the Serbs, the Croats or the Bosniacs and see it only as they would like it to be, to their taste.
In BiH today, there are political forces that would prefer erasing Antifascism from the history of this country. There are also strong political forces that prefer, mildly put, forgetting the ZAVNOBiH principles. Negating ZAVNOBiH and its principles, as principles that ensure the equality of all BiH peoples and citizens, on the entire territory of BiH, is in fact a negation of the existence of BiH as a state. It is also a negation of the present universal democratic principles, the principles equalizing all people, regardless of their ethnic background, religious belief, political affiliation, etc.
Regarding the appropriate ways to celebrate the BiH Independence Day, i.e. not celebrating it in certain areas, I wish to emphasize the following:
The day of signing the Dayton Peace Agreement is an important day of the recent BiH history and no one should or can refute it, however, November 25 – the ZAVNOBIH Day – is sacred, untouchable and the only Independence Day of our homeland.
Those that negate it should be aware of the fact that by negating November 25 they are also negating the principle of constitutionality of all peoples in all parts of the BiH territory. In that way, and citing the national interests of their people, they are, most of all, harming their very own people denying them the same rights on the entire territory of BiH, especially in those parts of BiH where their people are not a majority.
The principle that certain parts of BiH are in fact a war trophy of peoples, parties, individuals and an exclusive life space for members of one ethnic, religious, political or any kind of group, is in fact Fascism. Need I remind you that the fascism has already been defeated once and historically speaking, does not stand a chance?
Dear friends,
It seems that the ZAVNOBiH principles have never been more necessary than today. The resistance to the equality of peoples and individuals on the entire territory of BiH is strong. It comes from the political and interest groups that, above all, protect their material and economic interest, often criminal, as well as their war trophies, by inspiring fear in ordinary people, citing the so-called national interests. As if the highest nationals interest is not living in security and peace, having equal rights as others, regardless of the ethnic, religious, political or any other affiliation, regardless of the quantity, regardless of the political conviction, regardless of the part of BiH in which we live, or similar. In long term, that policy of fear does not stand a chance, in BiH or in the Balkan, especially in the united Europe.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is our homeland, built on the several-century long way of life. The way of life, that of course means us living with each other, not beside each other.
Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, for some time now, simply put, our civilized way of life has been in danger. The way of life with room for all of us, different as we are, as God or the nature has made us!
Will we defend it?
I will!
Happy holiday and thank you!"
27144,Address of the Chairman of Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency H.E. Mr. Željko Komšić on the occasion of The Srebrenica Investment Conference,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27144&langTag=en-US,2007-11-05,"It is a great honor and pleasure to welcome you, and to wish you a pleasant stay and pleasant company at this reception organized on the occasion of The Srebrenica Investment Conference.
Sarajevo 05.11.2007, Konak residency
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, your Excellencies, distinguished media representatives.....
It is a great honor and pleasure to welcome you, and to wish you a pleasant stay and pleasant company at this reception organized on the occasion of The Srebrenica Investment Conference.
We all know that 12 years ago Srebrenica unfortunately became a planetary known town of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so on this occasion I will not remind you of the tragic event that forever placed Srebrenica in the history as a place where genocide occurred.
This is a time when we have to help Srebrenica to leave the dark tunnel of desolate streets; somber facades covered with grenade scars and ill feeling of death that can be felt by looking at each of the thousands of tomb stones in Srebrenica.
Time and life require of us to turn to future, and there is no future without work, but also without the aid required in that sense.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small and developing country, but a country which wishes to join the circle of developed countries. Not as a pendant or an adolescent who always needs help, but as someone who will do Europe and ourselves proud.
I would like to emphasize that this is the moment to encourage Srebrenica to integrate itself in the wider economic development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also of the South Eastern Europe. Furthermore this is the moment to encourage not only foreign but domestic investment as well, investment that will help this area to stand on its own feet and to move forward to, I’m convinced, a brighter future.
Personally, I believe that regardless of the current political uncertainty our country is facing, it is time that we turn to economic development and prosperity, that will not only for us, but especially for the future generations open a road towards a better tomorrow and give them a reason to stay here and build Bosnia and Herzegovina as better, more beautiful and much more appealing to live in, instead of waiting in lines and doing everything in order to leave their homeland.
This Conference is an opportunity to concretely consider possibilities of what can be done for the area of Srebrenica, to make return sustainable, not only thru donations and aid, but mostly thru investing in development of infrastructure as well as economic potentials and capacities, because people in Srebrenica wish and want to work.
I believe that this is the only way to motivate young people to come, to return, to stay and to decide to build their better tomorrow there, because there is no future anywhere without educated and qualified youth.
My wishes and my work are focused in this direction. I wish for others to except it and I will be especially happy and proud if The Srebrenica Investment Conference leads this way.
As for mutual solidarity I will appeal and address only the mayors of the municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by function my former colleagues. I know that every municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina has a great deal of its own problems but the situation in Srebrenica is now the hardest. However, with a little of heart and soul each of the municipalities can in its own way help Srebrenica and I am sure that Srebrenica will never forget this and will give them back much more.
In the end I would like to take the opportunity to welcome you and to thank you for showing your support to the conference and to the development of Srebrenica area.
I wish you a pleasant evening and thank you once again for your presence."
27091,"Speech of esteemed cardinal Tercisio Bertone, the Secretary of State",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=27091&langTag=en-US,2007-10-25,"Mr. President, the esteemed, the revered, ladies and gentlemen,
Today is a historic day in the relations between the Holy See and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It signifies the end of an era and the beginning of a new that one we want marked with a long and fruitful cooperation. The importance of the act is evident: regulations agreed with the Basic Agreement signed on April 19, 2006 went into effect due to it; the Agreement designated the paragraphs of mutual interest for the Catholic Church’s life and work in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They notably referred to the recognition of a legal personality of the Catholic Church and its institutions within the civil society, its independence in piety and apostolate, its specific contributions in cultural, educational, pastoral, military, philanthropic and charity area, as well as the medias.
Mr. President,
I thank you for your words, as well as for the atmosphere in which the path of negotiations was completed.
Not going into further details, I would only like to remind that the Agreement signified a positive process of strengthening the law and democratic principles on which Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to base its future. Practicing religious freedom by every individual citizen and religious community in a legal framework is actually an unavoidable foundation of the western culture and represents a necessary condition for respecting the human rights in all parts of the world. However, the principle of equality before the law requiring a different position toward the different realities is recognized in the same manner. Therefore, in this case, contrary to what may happen in case of other religious communities, we are faced with a legal instrument that has an international character, as a consequence of the fact that the Holy See, i.e. the central administration of the Catholic Church, consisted of the Roman Archpriest and institutions of the Roman Curia helping him in His service (usp. ZKP, kan. 361), is a subject of the international law, independent due to the fact that it enjoys the same sovereignty in the territory of Vatican as any other state. Particularity of the institutional organization of the Catholic Church therefore requires special position on the part of the States, so that its believers would be guaranteed the generally recognized rights in a special way.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In a country, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, which includes a multiethnic and multireligious society within its borders, this Agreement represents the best legal guarantee of ensuring a proper implementation of religious life, first of all in its public implications. Proper implementation of the agreed will favor the country, since it will present a positive image of itself in the international scene; it will contribute to surpassing difficult problems inherited from the past and building a better future; country’s aspirations can be achieved in the future, the country which historically and geographically represents a unique crossroads of different identities, but which rightfully belongs to Europe.
Its diversity, in a globalized world such as ours, should become everybody’s source of enrichment. The Holy See, on its part, will not stop paying a special attention to different issues that appear in that joint walk, and wished the Catholic believers’ community to continue to contribute to the enrichment of the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The additional protocol, signed on September 29, 2006, which is an integral part of the agreement, envisages an appeal of the mixed commission that might support its interpretation and application. I am convinced that the commission will be useful for preserving the spirit of cooperation that marked the course of negotiations.
Mr. President, the esteemed, the revered, ladies and gentlemen,
I whole-heartedly wish that the implementation of the regulations of this international agreement would benefit the peaceful coexistence and the entire development of the country, as well as to support the local Catholic Church in performing the task that Christ entrusted it with, for the wellbeing of the entire population of this country."

BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s Speech
Your Eminence, Mr. State Secretary, esteemed Cardinal Bertone,
It is my pleasure to greet you on behalf of the State institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially the BiH Presidency, as well as personally. I also greet the Holy See Delegation, particularly Cardinal Vinko Puljić, our fellow citizen and your colleague in the Cardinal Body, your associates and everyone present. I do it with a special pleasure, because the meeting organized on occasion of completing such an important and well-done job that everyone can be satisfied with, is actually a true and the deepest satisfaction.
The Basic Agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holy See, and its formal exchange of the ratification instruments that gathered us, began as an idea with your esteemed predecessor in these very premises in early nineties, last century, when the war was still going on in our country as well as the ordeal of the innocent people throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, I avail myself of the opportunity warmly to thank you for full support in those difficult times to our independent, threatened from outside and from within, and wounded country, the support that came from Pope John Paul II – a great pope, a serene memory and the Holy See, that has kept on till today, which I have witnessed during the today’s very affectionate talk with Pope Benedict XVI. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina do not forget the strong appeals of Voytila from 1992 to the European and world men of power to stop the war in our country, and the citizens do not forget his Sunday homilies either when he refused to miss the opportunity to warn about their trials. We also remember his efforts to appoint our man a cardinal of his Church and his sincere wishes to visit Sarajevo in early war years, 1994, to warn the world that senseless sufferings must cease. His two later friendly visits to our country, Sarajevo and Banjaluka, are also remembered, the visits that were inspired by preaching peace, just solutions and concern for the exiled and the refugees. We impatiently await Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, whom I had the opportunity to officially invite to visit us. Therefore, ratifying the Basic Agreement, whose serious preparations and adoption was accompanied by extremely good relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holy See, ended a phase of our bilateral relations and has simultaneously opened a new page that I hope we would fill in, directly and trough our diplomatic representatives, to a mutual pleasure.
Your Eminence, Mr. Secretary of State,
Allow me to use this brief address to emphasize the significance of the Basic Agreement in view of formally re-recognizing the two international subjects, the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holy See, with this document.
For our country, a community of equal peoples and citizens, multinational, multireligious, of multicultural efforts, civil in the sense that the religious communities have their guaranteed freedoms, that bears a special value not only at this moment.
By accepting the Agreement, we have accepted the international democratic principles of the modern world as our own; the atmosphere such as the one in the European Union countries, which membership Bosnia and Herzegovina desires.
It is worth emphasizing in the moment of completing the job that Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on this Agreement, has created a legal framework for the Catholic Church’s work in our country, which is a historic step forward. Of course, that is not favoring in regard to the other religious communities because Bosnia and Herzegovina is intensively working on contractual regulation of relations and all religious communities. This Basic Agreement was an inspiration to our work on similar agreements with other religious communities wherein his special value lies. I also believe that it can serve to the Holy See as a quality foundation for reaching bilateral agreements with those states that have conditioned demographic structure and are enriched with multicultural and multicivilization intricacies.
Your Eminence,
With all accompanying difficulties of the post-war and transitional society, Bosnia and Herzegovina sees itself as a member of the Euro-Atlantic integration. Formerly faster, nowadays slower than we would like, we are heading toward the European Union and NATO, as a safe environment in the great European family of peoples. Now, we are doing it in Bosnia and Herzegovina hoping to succeed and to offer the positive experience as our contribution to others within the mentioned integration and wider. Considering the positive historic secular experience and tradition, as well as the reality of the ever more restless and intolerant modern world, it seems that the choice has no alternative.
Your Eminence,
Wishing a fruitful continuation of a quality cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holy See, esteemed Mr. Cardinal, I thank you for your friendly and cordial reception for our delegation, and I reiterate my great pleasure for the fact that His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI received us all. I avail myself of the occasion to show proper respect to all those who worked hard on this job and I hope that the enthusiasm would continue. I am convinced that Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Holy See are heading for the period of fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation."

Towards the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the past century, Bosnia and Herzegovina was entering one of the most difficult eras of its long history.
The former state neared its expiration date. A plan was hatched for the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina by all means, including mass killings, concentration camps, ethnic cleansing and siege of the cities. In order to serve the goals of the Belgrade regime, the former Yugoslav Peoples Army was purged of all undesirable elements, and a media campaign that was to justify all that was forthcoming was orchestrated. A broad hatred was spread with the goal of severing all social mechanisms of multinational ties between the people, and a struggle for the biological survival of the Bosnian people and the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina was imminent. This was the time of ethnic mythology, heated passions, and utter confusion. Unveiled threats forecasted bloody years of a collapse of the state and the making of a new order. On the basis of the grand ambitions, especially by the then regime in Belgrade, it was clear from the very start that this would be a war against the civilians and that the struggles would be difficult and unequal.
Against such a backdrop, Alija Izetbegovic appeared on the Yugoslav scene. From the very beginning, he distinguished himself by calls for coexistence, affirmation of the values of togetherness, human rights and individual freedoms, tolerance and compromise, both in the inter-ethnic and inter-human relations. In the atmosphere that ruled that day, a man of such tolerance and such view of the world represented an enormous capital not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but for all others that sought a humanistic exit from a situation that was forced upon by the ideology of murder and brute force. Exclusiveness and force were completely alien to his world view and his composition. He was deeply aware of the difficult burden of the past, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but in the entire region, but he remained dedicated in his search for the possibilities of a peaceful solution and compromise.
He remained steadfast in his humanism, even during the hardest of moments, and he was particularly sensitive about human suffering, doing everything in his power to ensure that the victims that were inevitable would be minimal. He did not follow the policy of revenge, and he paid attention about the sensibilities of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina, about tradition, religion, culture and all that is sacred to humanity.
Because of this, those who defended Bosnia and Herzegovina can stand tall because they were not led by the policy of force that responded to brutality with more brutality, destruction, mass killing, concentration camps and all that which branded the aggressors on Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in their service. All that can still be seen today, and it is something that is recognized by the entire world. That policy was pursued with a hope that the seed of coexistence, nurtured by us for hundreds of years, will remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the war removes all masks, and the people show themselves for what they truly are, I can say with full certainty, as can all those who worked and shared difficult moments with him, that Alija was a brave man. He adopted difficult decisions when the choice was limited to bad and the worse. He entered the global stage with very little in favor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he persevered. The satisfaction is that he witnessed the defeat and the condemnation of the ideology that brought so much evil and misery to the people of this region. He ascribed the credit for this to our defenders above all others.
He always emphasized that the politics can accomplish only as much as the defenders on the ground allow it. And he always had special words of respect and love for the defenders.
During the long and difficult negotiations, he always sought out the possibility of compromise and peaceful solution, mindful above all of the people in our country who faced numerous tragedies. Srebrenica, and other grounds, are examples on which we should waste no words. He viewed the Dayton agreement as unjust, but he accepted it, as this was, after all, peace, which signified the end of killings, tragedies, and destruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Dayton agreement brought peace, but its very nature paved the road for disagreements and obstruction in the post-war period.
Alija Izetbegovic tried by all means to connect the broken mechanisms, he fostered the rebuilding of the inter-people and inter-ethnic relations in our country with his own example.
He was a man of a calm spirit, sedate, benevolent, and he knew how to respect an opinion that differed from his own. He was prone to philosophical reflection and a very amiable and valuable conversation partner.
On one occasion we flew over the Mediterranean coast. I remember that he then said “Look how pretty the earth is, but what good is that when us people are lousy.”
I remember our conversation in April 1992, on the occasion of the recognition of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said “See what can happen in one day,” and then he added, paraphrasing a thought from the Qur’an – “But after the hard part comes the easy part.”
With Alija Izetbegovic I shared the view on the reality of the former Yugoslavia and a similar understanding of the position of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosniak people in those difficult circumstances. We were connected by a shared vision of the future. It is with sadness that I have to say today that I myself, and I believe many others, missed the opportunity to more often examine our own beliefs with this wise man of great political prowess. However, I had the honor to closely work with him up until his death, a very premature death from the viewpoint of the need for his contribution. When the peace was established and when the amalgam of choice increased, President Izetbegovic and I had differences in interpreting the hierarchy of priorities, but we nonetheless remained equally committed in our determination for building a modern and democratic state.
Privately, with his passing I lost a friend and a strong footing.
Izetbegovic always steadfastedly asserted that the highway of Euro-Atlantic integration was the optimum direction of Bosnia and Herzegovina toward a stable and prosperous future. When pronouncing such a statesmanlike position, he always knew that he enjoyed the support of all those who love this country and who are ready to work on transforming that vision into reality.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the following:
President Izetbegovic left us all with a debt. The way we repay that debt we express our own commitment to a noble cause that he pursued: Bosnia and Herzegovina as a state and society of free people, such people who are more enriched by their differences than they are divided.
Let him rest in peace and thanks!"
26727,"Farewell speech of the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nebojša Radmanović, at the funeral of Dr Milan Jelić, the President of the Republic of Srpska in Modriča",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=26727&langTag=en-US,2007-10-03,"We do not realize it at first, we cannot understand. We are looking for reasons. There are none. Why good men, true friends leave? Then we begin to realize. True parents, good friends, the creators, they complete their missions, because they think faster than we do, they work more than we do, but leave traces, visible road signs.
Dear Jelić family,
Dear friends,
It has been peaceful and silent in Modriča and the entire Republic of Srpska for three days now. Polemics have silenced, there are no divisions, no different opinions. There is a reason for it. Dr Milan Jelić is departing, a son, a husband, a father, a brother, my friend, your friend, the President of the Republic of Srpska.
We do not realize it at first, we cannot understand. We are looking for reasons. There are none. Why good men, true friends leave? Then we begin to realize. True parents, good friends, the creators, they complete their missions, because they think faster than we do, they work more than we do, but leave traces, visible road signs. They should be understood and followed, then our friends are constantly near, then we never forget them. Milan’s traces are clear. We can read clear messages in them. They stem from his life, which was all dedicated to others. His concern about his family, his mother, his wife, his son, his workers at the Refinery, for athletes, for Modriča, for the Republic of Srpska, it was visible.
He wanted things better, prettier, not for himself, but for everybody else, he knew it was possible and how to reach it. Many obstacles in that way, in economy, education, sports, politics, he bravely and decisively jumped over, and some he destroyed for a reason.
No one like him expressed the formula of political living and survival in these restless areas that clearly and precisely; the formula is dialogue and agreement, consensus and compromise.
He was an honorable and straight man. “Freedom is life” – he often sincerely said. He valued honesty, he was honest to others and he expected honesty in return. He truly believed that we should and could live peacefully in this beautiful, yet restless area.
He never reached for someone else’s, but he clearly warned that we should protect our country, our people, and our religion carefully and decisively. It was never pointed against others and he proved it in action. With a successful organization and management, he practically showed that it is possible to suppress exclusivity and achieve success by enforcing tolerance and nurturing equality. Many failed to follow that visionary idea, especially to put it into effect in their political and daily life. That remains a visible road sign for his friends, especially the younger generations that he loved and unselfishly gave his knowledge.
Lifetime is measured in years, but in acts as well. Calculating the years, Milan lived shortly and left too soon, but he belonged to those that know that a man lives as long as his acts to. Therefore, he continued to create and he achieved a lot. His work is a trace we follow that we shall never loose.
Dear friend, you knew what your mission was and why you came to this world. You completed many tasks, we heard your messages and we shall never forget them. A three-day silence and the people’s dignity in the Republic of Srpska show how much everybody loved you and understood you and that binds your friends and followers and warns all the others.
May you rest in peace good man!"
26690,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s speech on occasion of the 15th anniversary of the 1st BiH Army Corps,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=26690&langTag=en-US,2007-10-01,"Allow me to greet you most cordially and congratulate the 15th anniversary of the 1st BiH Army Corps to us all.
“Dear guests,
Allow me to greet you most cordially and congratulate the 15th anniversary of the 1st BiH Army Corps to us all.
I welcome every soldier, former members of the 1st BiH Army Corps, officers, generals, receivers of the highest war decorations as well as all the present guests.
I especially welcome the members of the shehits’ and killed soldiers’ families.
Not so long ago, this valley and this city echoed in fire bursts, grenades were falling, screaming and crying everywhere! However, there was also song; fists and bodies of this city’s soldiers were clenching with a clear message,”We must persevere, no matter how hard it may be, and we will not give his city to anyone – because it is ours and it must be free! Free for the people who love it to live in it; free for living for those who are yet to be born.” Free for everybody, regardless of his or her name, which God he or she is praying to and for all those who are proud of such a Sarajevo!
Over 10.000 people from Sarajevo gave their lives in that path. Civilians, soldiers, children! We knew how to defend Sarajevo, defend BiH, that is why we have endured; and you can remember knowing it had not been easy. We started in sneakers from Yugosport and jeans, and ended as a respectable military force!
We fought in the bloody battles for the streets and squares, but also for the unknown hills and valleys around Sarajevo that we had not heard of before the war.
We fought for the order and discipline in our units; we fought for an honorable image of a BiH Army member, an image that would clearly show to everyone a difference between us – the defenders of Sarajevo, the members of the 1st Corps and those whose names I do not want even to mention.
In most cases, we succeeded, and we are proud of that and that is why we were supported and helped worldwide. To all those who helped us in any way during those most difficult moments, I thank you on this occasion on behalf of all of us.
However, for the sake of our honor and reputation, for the sake of the truth that is the only sanctuary of honorable and decent men, we must be honest!
There were those among us who did not behave in the war as it was ordered, those who stepped over the line of honor, military and human! There were those who committed horrible acts and crimes, against innocent victims as well as against the powerless enemy; acts and crimes that cannot be forgiven or forgotten.
For the sake of our honor and integrity, we must continue our battles from 15 years ago even today, but this time, also against those who wanted or attempted to sully our honor and heroic deeds. They must be punished. I first, and I believe all honorable members of the 1st Corps, will never accept the slightest stain in our war path because of them.
Therefore, I avail myself of the opportunity, as a highest positioned former member of the 1st BiH Army Corps in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a receiver of the highest Army decoration, on behalf on all honorable and decent fighters of this Corps, to apologize to the families whose members were subjected to impermissible and never ordered crimes and acts committed by certain renegades of this famous Corps. I hope that this apology can alleviate their pain and grief at least a little bit!
Dear fellow soldiers and friends!
You are witnesses, even today, that some still want to divide our country, that certain parts of the country are seen as their war trophy, a war trophy of an individual, party or one people. That is not possible in BiH, nor will it ever be! That is not normal in BiH, that is not the way to live here, nor has it ever been!
We do not accept that a part of BiH is not ours, regardless of its name. When I say ‘ours’, I think of all of us, Bosnians and Herzegovinians, Bosniacs, Serbs, Croats, Jews, others. The entire Bosnia and Herzegovina, every inch of it belongs to all of us, Bosnians and Herzegovinians! No more no less each, equally to all!
Those people do not see that their selfish fight for their daily political and so-call national interests obstruct the interests and wished of the youth from their very own nation.
Some people do not want to have our children studying peacefully together, going to school together, playing together, in the world of knowledge to fight for their place, their city and the country, family, i.e. their people, culture, religion…!
But, I say to you all, them also, BiH will survive, all of us here today such as were are; this country will be happier and prettier, economically wealthier, because that is a BiH we have fought for and that is how one day it is going to be!
Therefore, my dear friends and fellow soldiers let us remain in the same formation of soldiers for BiH that we have solemnly sworn to uphold by joining the ranks of the 1st BiH Army Corps.
This is an invitation to all the citizens of our capital Sarajevo, and entire BiH as well, to support us and together with us build our joint homeland BiH.
Thank you all!
Sarajevo, 01.10.2007"
26619,BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić’s address at the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=26619&langTag=en-US,2007-09-27,"It is my honor as a Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in this 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would also like, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your election and to use this opportunity to express my respect and gratitude to H.E. Mrs. Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa for her successful presentation during the 61st annual session.
Mister President,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor as a Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in this 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
I would also like, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your election and to use this opportunity to express my respect and gratitude to H.E. Mrs. Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa for her successful presentation during the 61st annual session.
Mister President,
The United Nations, as well as other organizations, depends on the collective strength of its members. Strength must stem from the consensus of the member countries.
In that context, I wish to point out my regret that the Security Council reform has lost its momentum. Over the last years, our countries’ delegations met at a global level, ready to complete the Millennium Declaration Goals, and the role of an efficient UN system has an instrumental significance in its completion.
It is known that my country, in the recent past, has paid a high price due to the imperfect and inefficient UN system. The United Nations themselves have admitted their guilt and in their Report underlined for Srebrenica that “United Nations’ experience in BiH was one of the hardest and most painful in the history of this organization”, that “Srebrenica crystallized the truth that the United Nations and the world had realized far to late: BiH was equally a moral obligation as it was a military conflict” and “the tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt us forever”. The International Court of Justice, the court of the United Nations, on 26.02.2007, gave a verdict in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro concerning the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide Crimes. The Court decided that genocide had been committed against the Bosnian Muslims in and around Srebrenica in the East Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of course, you will agree that it was not an isolated case; all the more reason for BiH decisively to dedicate itself, with a majority of members, to the necessary reform of the world organization.
In the light of that, BiH believes that only strong UN could be an efficient instrument for collective regulation of international relations based on the UN Charter and the International Law. Besides the necessary reform of the Security Council, it is necessary further to work on revitalization: including the reform of the General Assembly and its committees, the Economic and Social Council, the Secretariat and other bodies.
This also includes defining a series of issues, such as: the number and the category of the Security Council members; ways to elect new members; the veto right and its use; regional representation; working methods; and other, all speaking in behalf of the complexity of that ongoing reform process. Productive way ahead certainly leads to opening key negotiations in this context, instead of the previous consultations. I wish to emphasize that the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina – in case that the reform should result in an increase of non-permanent members of the Security Council- is that the eastern European group certainly deserves one more seat.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a multiethnic and multi-confessional country, with its historic heritage, experienced mistakes of the International Community; the United Nations above all, with severe repercussions to my country. However, a positive experience in the post-war peace construction and cooperation with the UN representatives, organs and agencies, could significantly contribute the United Nations to become an efficient instrument for collective regulation of international affairs. My country believes that peace and security cannot take place without economic and social development. It continues to support the Security Council as an unavoidable body of the international sphere of peace and progress in rights of all nations. Since BiH has outlasted the test of historic challenges and is now able to offer its experience to the turbulent world, it is determined to intensify its commenced activities regarding the candidacy of BiH for the non-permanent Security Council member in the period of 2010 – 2012, expecting an understanding and support of the United Nations member countries for our election in the Security Council.
Mister President,
I come from a country that made a shift from a post-conflict phase to building a modern democratic society and has embarked on the path of integration in the European and Trans-Atlantic structures. Therefore, my country is fully dedicated to strengthening international cooperation at the regional, European and global plan.
With a special satisfaction, I can now stress out that BiH is an active participant in all initiatives and process of regional cooperation of the South East Europe.
During 2007, BiH has received important recognitions for its proactive approach at a regional level. At the SEECP Summit in Zagreb, held on May 10, 2007, a decision was made to elect Sarajevo the Headquarters of the Regional Cooperation Council Secretariat (RCC). The establishment of RCC represents a final phase of South East Europe Stability Pact’s transformation, i.e. the process of taking regional responsibility by the Stability Pact member countries, that is, SEEC member countries. With this decision, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes the center of the future regional cooperation.
BiH has also accepted Sarajevo to be the host of the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative Secretariat; by doing so, this initiative has been transformed from the framework of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe into a regional property. In October 2007, a BiH representative will assume the managerial position at the Regional Arms Control Verification and Implementation Assistance Center (RACVIAC), with the Headquarters in Zagreb.
BiH continues an active cooperation with the regional countries in fight against organized crime. We are actively participating in the SECI Centre for Cross-Border Crime Prevention’s work in Bucharest. By achieving an efficient cooperation with the neighboring countries, establishment of an electronic system for personal documents issuance, as well as an efficient management of border control, BiH has managed significantly to reduce the number of illegal migrants across its territory, as well as all forms of cross-border crime.
With the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, we are developing cooperation in detection and prevention of illegal transport, i.e. the proliferation of radioactive material across the BiH territory.
With the neighboring countries, BiH is building relations based on equality, full independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. BiH and its neighbors are aware of the fact that development can be fully achieved only by joining the European Union. The goal will be accomplished by continuing the development of neighborly relations in all areas, the democratization of the regional countries and accepting general European standards.
The position of BiH is not interfering in internal issues of sovereign countries, and believes that the Kosovo issue solution should be sought within the dialogue of the concerned parties. BiH supports Belgrade-Priština dialogue, and within regional initiatives, it is prepared to help in finding the solution that would be acceptable for both sides. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the engagement of the Contact Group mediating troika and hopes that they would find a modus for solving the Kosovo status issue. A longer delay in reaching the final Kosovo issue solution would in long-term surely bring negative consequences for the region of Balkan.
Concerning the wider international level, BiH has also achieved important breakthroughs.
In late 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited to join the NATO Partnership for Peace program as a full-fledged member.
The new recognition followed during the elections for the Human Rights Council (HRC), held in May 2007, when BiH became a member of this new, extremely important body within the system of UN.
On May 31, 2007, BiH assumed the chairmanship duty of the Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC) signed by 126 UN member countries. My country and the Code signatory countries, believing in a collective security, are ready to fight against proliferation of missile technology and are aware of a great threat that non-State factors possessing it pose, which could misuse it for destructive purposes in the world. Therefore, I would like to invite the countries that have not yet joined HCOC, especially those with ballistic capacity, to join the Code. Additionally, I would like to invite all UN members to vote for the Framework of the relevant resolution prepared by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Portugal.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, within its possibilities, has participated and will continue to participate in activities of the International Coalition in fight against terrorism, and has declaratively decided to join the activities of the European Union in view of stamping out terrorism.
In 2006, the BiH Council of Ministers adopted the BiH Strategy for fighting terrorism for the period 2006-2009. The Draft of Reviews and Amendments to the BiH Penal Code in its part concerning the fight against terrorism is in procedure, which will define measures more precisely, i.e. sanctions in fight against international terrorism, in accordance with the international conventions.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the intention of other UN members to continue with joint efforts in order to strengthen the UN system for human rights, aiming to ensure the conditions for all people to enjoy all human rights – civil, economic, culture, political, social, development and others.
BiH has accepted the Initiative of the Italian Government to co-sponsor the Resolution on Universal Moratorium on Execution and Abolishment of Death Penalty, which is scheduled for evaluation during the UNGA session.
BiH achieved a significant progress in meeting the requirements according to the instruments for protection of human rights, by filing relevant reports to the UN High Commissariat of Human Rights in Geneva.
I also want to avail myself of this opportunity to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina in UN, during the last couple of years, in cooperation with Jordan, has promoted the work on the new humanitarian world order so that the world would become more efficient in his adequate response and reaction to humanitarian disasters.
Mister President,
The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain permanently resolved to maintain full cooperation with ICTY. All persons suspected of war crimes in the territory of former Yugoslavia, must be brought to justice.
So far, positive steps in cooperation with the Hague Tribunal have been made, on the issue of processing the indictments and delivering the suspects, contacts among competent authorities, ensuring the access to the documentation, creating the working conditions for the court representatives and others in the territory of BiH.
In BiH, a legal framework was created and processing war crimes in the special division of the BiH Court for War Crimes has begun, which is one of the requirements for establishing mutual trust and reconciliation in the post-conflict BiH. Besides that, ICTY should not stop with work until the most wanted war crime suspects are brought to justice, especially the war leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić and others.
Mister President,
BiH supports all activities and peace initiatives are directed at conflict prevention. It carefully monitors and supports activities of the Roadmap for establishing a permanent peace in the Middle East. BiH has military observers in Congo and Ethiopia and civilian police in Sudan, Cyprus, Liberia and Haiti, within peace operations of UN. Additionally, BiH has sent a smaller mine action unit to Iraq, as our help to the Iraqi people in establishing a democratic self-sustainable country.
We are convinced that strengthening the UN multilateralism could bring efficient measures in prevention of armed conflicts. In that sense, it is necessary to respect the principles of political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, guided by the Declaration on International Law Principles and in full respect of human rights. BiH supports the Quartet Initiative and the Roadmap that provides basis for opening a true dialogue between Israel and Palestine, with the US mediation, and in lines of EU views. BiH appeals for comprehensive, unconditional and reciprocal cessation of hostilities, release of all prisoners and reopening a dialogue on the final two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
BiH invites all ethnic and religious communities in Iraq to abandon sectarianism, actively join political processes, and with joint efforts of the International Community and the Iraqi Government, to encourage the comprehensive national political dialogue, placing an emphasis on full respect of the Geneva Convention set of rules from 1949.
Bearing in mind the possible catastrophic consequences of aggravating the crisis of the Iranian program of nuclear technology development, BiH welcomes Iranian readiness for full cooperation with the International Nuclear Energy Agency and political dialogue with the key actors.
The UN role in solving conflict situations in the world is essential. UN did not play an adequate role granted by the Charter during the world crises, especially in the former Yugoslavia. Iraqi crisis shows how many weaknesses UN is facing in tackling issue of conflict prevention in the world. Unless UN assumes responsibilities mandated by the Charter, a series of numerous unilateral interventions could occur, without the UN control, which could bring grave consequences to the international stability.
Foreign policy of BiH is directed at preservation and enhancement of permanent peace, security and stabile democratic and comprehensive state development and contribution to the international peace and security. In international relations, activities of Bosnia and Herzegovina are based on principles contained in the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and other documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the generally accepted International Law principles.
Recognizing the threat that nuclear, chemical and biological/bacteriological weapon poses to peace and security in the world, especially if possessed by terrorists, BiH has undertaken significant steps toward the establishment of a complete control and prevention of mass destruction weapon dissemination.
BiH has ratified or successively taken the most important international documents from this field, and is ready, in view of an efficient fight against the dissemination of weapon for mass destruction and their means of delivery, for a full cooperation with other countries, as within the relevant multilateral organizations and initiatives, as in the bilateral level.
BiH has adopted the Law on Implementation of Chemical Weapon Prohibition Convention.
As one of the countries most severely affected by the consequences of distribution of explosive elements during the previous war, BiH pays a special attention to the implementation of responsibilities deriving from the Ottawa Convention.
BiH is actively involved in UN programs related to AIDS relief and prevention, an illness that is spreading over the world more and more. BiH’s fight against this vicious disease was defined in the Strategy for Prevention and Fight against AIDS for the period of 2004–2009.
BiH regularly pays its contributions to UN and all other international organizations whose member it is. BiH appeals to other countries as well, especially great contributors, to carry out their duties on time. Above all, this applies to ICTY funding and UN Budget for peace operations, for which member countries have not been regularly paying their contributions.
Mister President,
Two days ago, we had, above all useful and constructive exchange of opinions concerning one of the most serious and potentially dangerous phenomenons of our time – climate change.
I wish to use this opportunity to stress out the crucial importance of a timely and efficient treatment of this issue in the world organization. My country has ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change back in 2000, which went into effect on July 15, 2007. I invite UN members that still have not done so, to do it immediately.
I thank you for your patience and attention.

26548,Speech by BiH Presidency Chairman Željko Komšić at the UN Special Session on Climate Change – New York (09,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=26548&langTag=en-US,2007-09-24,"It is my honor and pleasure, as a Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to participate in the meeting that deals with one of the most challenging issues of our time – the climate change.
Dear Chairmen,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my honor and pleasure, as a Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to participate in the meeting that deals with one of the most challenging issues of our time – the climate change.
Constructive approach to this global issue certainly surpasses the competencies of the respective countries and prompts us differently to view this planet, on which and of which we live. In any case, not from a perspective of our own selfish interest, but from a perspective of sustainable development, i.e. survival of future generations, bearing in mind the necessary basis for the survival of the entire life on earth. If we have been faced with globalization primarily in the economic field, now, we are facing, above all, a serious, planetary problem of global warming.
In spite of the truly impossible mission of predicting the climate development in full, as well as the consequences of its change, there are data that raise no doubt. According to the latest studies, these past 11 years have been the warmest over the last 150 years.
The warming trend is considerably affecting all continents and oceans, and has an extremely negative impact, particularly on the poorest and least developed countries.
There is no dilemma on the need to establish a continuous and productive dialogue, thus avoiding all forms of polarization in debates, especially for the sake of common good, and to do everything possible clearly to articulate the voice of the least developed, poor and vulnerable.
Dear Chairmen,
Allow me briefly to inform you about the activities undertaken in Bosnia and Herzegovina within our today’s debate on the subject of climate change.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2000. The Kyoto Protocol accession instrument of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been deposited at the depository – United Nations Secretary-General on 16.04.2007, and went into force on 15.07, 2007.
Synchronizing the national legislation with the requirements of the European Commission is a priority of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and joining the Kyoto Protocol represented, for our country, one of the basic and key steps in the process of European integration. The next step is the establishment of the Clean Development Mechanisms, and preparations in my country are underway.
The level of greenhouse gasses effects in Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently lower than the level in the specified year of 1990. In spite of that, there is already a series of programs underway in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as energy consummation rationalization, gasification, afforestation, healthy food production programs etc, which represents a significant basis for joining the protective international activities against global change.
That includes the improvement of meteorological and hydrological system and efficient execution of climate programs within the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), systematic observation and exploration of climate, as well as the maximum development of renewable energy sources (water, wind, sun etc.) and biomass.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has also recently signed the Agreement on Regional Energy Community based on the Athens Memorandum from 2002/3, which established an integrated market of natural gas and electric energy of the South East Europe, based on common interest and solidarity. The goal of the Agreement was to create a legal and economic framework for energy network establishment in the South East Europe and its connecting with the European network, and includes EU acquis implementation in the area of energy, environment, competition and renewable energy sources.
Dear Chairmen,
Today, more than yesterday, and tomorrow inexorably intensive, our countries are becoming complexly interconnected and dependent on each other, and, by the same definition, faced with global climate change, whose impacts must be efficiently tackled by our governments sooner or later, in cooperation with the rest of the world, all in view of sustainable development.
I thank you for attention."

In addition to film and other cultural activities we had an opportunity, and I am sure that we have used it well, to prove ourselves as good hosts.
Every festival year is a new celebration, a new reason to be happy and to remember the very first beginnings of this festival which started in hard times when it meant something that gave us hope, desire and strength to live.
Throughout years, the Sarajevo Film Festival has grown, developed and matured, so what we have today, I dare to say, is the most prestigious and most influential film festival in the region which is at the same time well known, recognised and appreciated in the whole world.
That is the role assuming huge responsibility, but above all, the festival is primarily the image of heart and sole of our country and Sarajevo.
So let us be content and proud because we take part in something which throughout the years has raised the reputation of BiH to the highest cultural level.
I am happy to see a number of guests who will carry the most beautiful impressions and memories from Sarajevo and most probably will share them with others making it possible for them also to feel the warmth of this city and this country.
In the spirit of our hospitality and kindness I hope you will enjoy this evening.
Thank you..."

Dear Mr. Radmanović, Excellencies, generals, officers and noncommissioned officers, esteemed guests, dear friends!
It is my great honor to greet you most cordially, wishing that this meeting would take place in a festive and comfortable atmosphere, worthy of the importance of the BiH Armed Forces and the US Armed Forces to all of us.
Today’s festivity shows that Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the best way to become a full-fledged member of NATO, which is one of our strategic state priorities. I must emphasize that this day also best depicts the friendship between BiH and USA and the unselfish support that USA has been showing to our country.
The significance of the BiH Armed Forces is the most illustratively shown by the recent fires across BiH that would have been practically impossible to localize and extinguish without the outstanding contribution and engagement of the members and the technology of the BiH Armed Forces.
The BiH Armed Forces’ members are doing their utmost to perform and execute the concrete assignments and necessary reforms in the most efficient, professional and quality way. For that reason, the State of BiH must ensure and provide them all necessary for their work and functioning in accordance with the NATO standards.
BiH unstoppably continues its journey to the Euro-Atlantic integration and the EU membership. Our future faces peace and healthy relation development between neighbors. Our imperative is creating conditions for economic prosperity of a sound, stabile, healthy, strong and even prettier and happier BiH, whose component part – Armed Forces – are organized in accordance with the highest NATO standards.

25394,Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojša Radmanović at the Energy Summit of the Heads of South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=25394&langTag=en-US,2007-06-24,"Present production of electrical energy satisfies not only the current needs of the consumers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but about 10% of the produced energy is exported which is not characteristic for the region.
Distinguished Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to greet all the participants of the Summit. Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to our host the President Mesic, for initiating and organizing this event. It is of a crucial importance for our European future to exchange our experiences and views through the events like this one, as well as to foster more cooperation in all the fields of importance for our people and good mutual relations.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
General globalization of the world economy and modern trends of liberalization and privatization reached the energy sector which is going through the process of fundamental reforms. Energy sector, from the very beginning up to the last decade of the past century, conservative and strictly regulated one, has been opened to the market where the competition and a free choice were making the principles for its functioning. Liberalization of the energy market has given the strong impetus to the efficiency and investments growth, as the key development factors. European Energy Charter from 1991 and the Directions of the European Union on liberalization of the energy market of the member countries had the key role in starting the process of establishing of the global liberalized energy market in Europe. As the part of the European family, by the Athens Memorandum we have expressed our commitment for establishing the regional energy market in the South-East Europe and therefore opened the way for integration into the internal energy market of the European Union. Our commitment was recognized by the signing the Treaty on Establishing the Community of South-East Europe. With participation in this process, Bosnia and Herzegovina confirms its determination for energy sector reform, liberalization of the energy market and harmonization of policy with the EU standards. It represents a great challenge and hope for all of us. Our common need is to develop a stable regulatory and market framework which would attract the investors to the energy sector for ensuring the stable energy supply which is of key importance for our economic development and stability.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has large unused development potentials in the energy sector. The estimations were that the existing installed power of 4052 MW in hydro-electric and thermo-power stations could be more than three times increased by building new hydro-electric power stations and modernizing the existing ones, as well as building new thermo-electric power plants. In activating the energy potentials Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized a great development chance in order to ensure long term energy stability for the country and the region.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The energy sector suffered from the large war damage in this territory. Owing to the significant international community donation support and favorable loans of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development the reconstruction of the electric power sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina was successfully done. Normal and consistent electric energy supply was established through increased coal production and reconstruction of production and transmission capacities. Electric energy production achieved the pre-war level. Electric power transmission network was interconnected with the neighboring countries, thus becoming the integral part of the European energy market. Present production of electrical energy satisfies not only the current needs of the consumers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but about 10% of the produced energy is exported which is not characteristic for the region. The three vertically integrated electric power industries, two in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and one in the Republic of Srpska, are functioning successfully thus realizing satisfactory results.
In order to ensure faster economic progress towards safer and more stable long term energy supply, during the last and this year the numerous initiatives and steps have been taken by the Governments of the Entities to attract foreign investors for modernizing the existing and building new energy capacities.
Allow me to emphasize some of the above mentioned developing projects. The Republic of Srpska Government concluded the agreement with the electric power industry of the Czech Republic (CEZ) on construction of the new thermo-electric power station called Gacko 2, in the place of Gacko, with installed power of 660 MW, and modernization of the existing thermo-electric power station of 300 MW. In this project it will be invested around 1.4 billion euros thus representing one of the largest investments in the region. In the vicinity of the lignite mine called Stanari the EFT Group from London was planning to realize the project of building a modern thermo-electric power plant of installed power of 420 MW. The estimated investment is 650 million euros. State-owned capital sale of the oil refineries in Brod and Modrica to the Russian company Zarubezneft was successfully done, thus ensuring more stable and safer oil derivatives markets supply. Apart from that in the last and this year in Bosnia and Herzegovina was approved more that 120 concessions for building small hydroelectric power plants.
The encouraging fact is that there is a large interest from foreign and domestic investors in investing into the electro energy sector. It is also the challenge for the countries of our region to jointly invest into the construction of the new energy capacities. Bosnia and Herzegovina is open for such endeavors.
Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities Governments put high priority to the energy sector reforms. Our key goal is to make the legislation related to the electric power compatible to the European Union practice and establish the regulatory framework to create the conditions for new investments and competition and opening energy and natural gas markets. We see the realization of this goal in further development of the integration in the region and, within it the important part is to establish regional electricity and natural gas market which will increase the degree of exchange within the region, greater competition and direct foreign investments inflow.
Acting as the signatory country of the Athens Memorandum and the Treaty of Energy Community of South Eastern Europe, I would like to renew our full support and willingness for fully implementation of the requirements from the document.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has already achieved significant results in restructuring the energy sector, establishing regulatory framework in legislative and institutional way, long-term review of development as well as separating production, transmission and distribution of the electricity, in order to avoid reciprocal subventions. The process of electricity market liberalization has started and, as of 1 January this year, the electricity market was liberalized for all the customers with annual consumption of over 10 GWH. In the next year it was planned to enable all the customers, apart from households, a free choice of the electricity supplier, and as of 1 January 2015, to all the customers including the households as well. There is lot to be done in this dynamic process such as to improve the legislation, increase the activities of the regulatory bodies, liberalize the market, and especially in the environment protection.
We are confident that this support and determination towards establishing the common energy market will open a great developing perspective to the entire region. I believe that we shall use that chance for the benefit of our people and the countries of the region.
Thank you!"
25295,Address by the BiH Presidency member Dr Haris Silajdžić at the meeting of Political Directors of Peace Implementation Council Steering Board,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=25295&langTag=en-US,2007-06-18,"Mr. Komsic and I today dispatched a letter to the UN Secretary General and to over a hundred governments and international organizations, asking for the same thing I ask of you tonight: assistance with transforming Bosnia and Herzegovina into a modern, functional, democratic, European states, with equality and justice for all its people in every portion of its territory.
Respected excellencies,
First of all, please allow me to welcome you to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to express my deep appreciation for your continued engagement toward peace and stability in our country and the region as a whole. I am especially grateful for your assistance with our efforts to embark on the road towards Euro-Atlantic integrations, which will benefit the entire country and all its people.
The Peace Implementation Council has been engaged in Bosnia and Herzegovina for almost twelve years now. Without a doubt, progress has been made. Immediately following the war and genocide, Bosnia and Herzegovina was severely crippled, with some 200,000 people dead and countless wounded, with over a million refugees and displaced persons, and with its economy and infrastructure literally in ruins. We all, including all of you here, inherited that situation.
However, because of the hundreds of thousands of lives that were lost, because of another half a million that never returned to their homes, those who for a decade now have insisted on full implementation of the Dayton Agreement and on reforms, and those who have done everything to undermine Dayton and block reforms, cannot be equated, as some in the international community attempt to do. This strategy cannot bring Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to Europe and NATO and cannot guarantee long term peace and stability. In order to accomplish those goals, a serious and meaningful change in policy course is required.
Throughout the war, the international community did far too little to end the murderous campaign the like of which Europe had not seen since the dark days of the Holocaust. As the UN Report on Srebrenica said, the embargo: AND I QUOTE: “left the Serbs in a position of overwhelming military dominance and effectively deprived the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of its right, under the Charter of the United Nations, to self-defense.” END QUOTE Only after the genocide at Srebrenica did the U.S.-led air strikes force Serbia and the Republika Srpska leadership to the negotiating table, resulting in the Dayton Agreement. Dayton stopped genocide, but left Bosnia and Herzegovina divided into two semi-autonomous entities, its multi-ethnic character all but obliterated and its central institutions virtually powerless.
Today, almost twelve years after the war, the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina remains hostage to ethno-territorial arrangements. Some of these arrangements are found directly in the Constitution, which constitutes Annex 4 of the Dayton Agreement, but most of them are the result of the fact that the Dayton Agreement was only partially implemented. In particular, Annex 7, which guarantees the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes failed to be implemented in any meaningful way, particularly with respect to the territory of the Republika Srpska entity.
And then, there is the judgment of the world’s highest judicial body – the International Court of Justice. As you are all aware, on February 26, the ICJ unequivocally ruled that – AND I QUOTE – “the acts committed at Srebrenica were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly these were acts of genocide,” committed by the institutions of Republika Srpska, namely by the Army of Republika Srpska and the Police of Republika Srpska.
As the United Nations Report on Srebrenica states – AND I QUOTE AGAIN – “As part of the larger ambition for a ‘Greater Serbia,’ the Serbs set out to occupy the territory of the enclaves; they wanted the territory for themselves. The civilian inhabitants of the enclaves were not the incidental victims of the attackers; their death or removal was the very purpose of the attacks upon them. The Bosnian Muslim civilian population thus became the principal victim of brutally aggressive military and para-military Serb operations to depopulate coveted territories in order to allow them to be repopulated by Serbs.” END QUOTE
As is evident today, it was a job well-done. After all, the name “Republika Srpska” literally means “the Republic of the Serbs,” and from the pre-war population of over forty-five percent Bosniaks and Croats, only four percent of non-Serbs remain in that part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thus, the situation that has been created in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that has been further solidified through the partial and selective implementation of the Dayton Agreement, is a direct result of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Don’t take my word for it, simply refer again the ICJ’s Judgment and the UN’s Srebrenica Report, or any of the dozens of ICTY’s judgments. Hence, Slobodan Milosevic’s project lives on.
However, the principles of customary international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility, and as reproduced in a 2001 U.N. General Assembly resolution 56/83, mandate that – I QUOTE – “no State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach of a peremptory norm of general international law,” which includes the crime of genocide and the crimes against humanity, “nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.”
It is unfortunate that some in the international community ignore these legal obligations, choosing the path of least resistance by pursuing the option of not meddling with the “situation on the ground,” while fully aware of how such a situation was created in the first place. If you ask us to accept the results of Milosevic’s project, that is something that we cannot do. It is, indeed, impossible to do so while at the same time remaining steadfastly committed to reform.
With all due respect, I must ask you: what are the bases of the international community’s current policy toward Bosnia and Herzegovina? What are the bases of the proclaimed reform? The Dayton Agreement has not been fully implemented. International conventions and other international legal obligations have been severely violated. The ICJ’s judgment is being ignored. At the last elections the people clearly stated what they want and what they do not want. It is unclear, then, what remains. It is clear who wants status quo and who wants reform. The only thing that remains unclear is whether the international community will adopt the legal and moral highground, the sole guarantees of permanent peace and stability, or it will support the status quo.
We are accused of focusing on the past and not looking into the future, but let’s examine the facts for a moment. We have introduced changes to the Citizenship Law in order to ensure that over a half a million Bosnian refugees – scattered throughout the world for no other reason than as a result of genocide and ethnic cleansing – do not lose their Bosnian citizenship. Ten deputies from the Republika Srpska entity have repeatedly used entity veto to block this law with the sole – and proclaimed – goal of divesting those people of their citizenship.
We have introduced a law prohibiting denial of the Holocaust and genocide in order to criminalize behavior that we see daily on the streets and the stadiums of Republika Srpska and which greatly stifles the return. The same ten deputies blocked that law as well. You then told that it was our fault that the law was blocked because we “did not draft it properly.” For your information, the law was modeled almost entirely on a similar Belgian law, and does not appreciatively differ from similar laws in force in eleven EU countries.
We have accepted all attempts at Police reform, even when every subsequent attempt included serious erosions of the previously agreed-upon solutions. We balked at preserving Police of Republika Srpska, but we offered a compromise that would have created the Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Republika Srpska. This proposal fully follows the instructions of Mr. Vincenzo Coppola, the Chief of EU’s Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who unequivocally stated last month that in order to satisfy the European standards, AND I QUOTE: “You may have the police in Republika Srpska, but not the police of Republika Srpska.”
You proclaim that you want us to follow the European standards of freedom, equality and democracy, but criticize us when we actually take you seriously and attempt to apply those standards in practice.
These are the facts and they cannot be disputed, not with a straight face anyway. It is, indeed, abundantly clear who in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not want reform and who does. The Council of Europe told us that reform must entail elimination of entity voting and we based our positions on that directive. The European Parliament then told us that entity voting may henceforth apply only to a limited set of competencies, and last month in Washington we agreed to a U.S. proposal along those lines.
Indeed, entity voting would not even be a contentious issue if the Dayton Agreement had been fully implemented. If refugees had returned to Republika Srpska – as mandated by Annex 7 – entity veto would not be an ethno-territorial mechanism that is used by the leadership of this entity to block any and all reform aimed at making Bosnia and Herzegovina a modern, democratic and functional member of the European family of nations. It is the leadership of that entity that focuses on the past, with the sole aim of preserving the situation created by, in the words of the United Nations, “the operations to depopulate coveted territories in order to allow them to be repopulated by Serbs.”
While I am convinced that you are all mindful of the fact that is the Republika Srpska leadership that is responsible for the political stalemate, you must find a political will to identify the culprit, however strategically or politically inconvenient that may be at the present time. Instead of justifying the current course by the alleged “fights” of the local politicians, it must be answered why Dayton has not been fully implemented. There are, indeed, no “fights.” There are only those who want to keep Milosevic’s project alive and those who want to end it. The international community must take the principled stance in this struggle, as any other solution threatens to further destabilize Bosnia and Herzegovina and to seriously reflect on the stability of the region in the long-run.
Mr. Komsic and I today dispatched a letter to the UN Secretary General and to over a hundred governments and international organizations, asking for the same thing I ask of you tonight: assistance with transforming Bosnia and Herzegovina into a modern, functional, democratic, European states, with equality and justice for all its people in every portion of its territory.
The UN Srebrenica Report said – AND I QUOTE – “The UN experience in Bosnia was one of the most difficult and painful in our history. Through error, misjudgment and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder. No one regrets more than we the opportunities for achieving peace and justice that were missed. No one laments more than we the failure of the international community to take decisive action to halt the suffering and end a war that had produced so many victims. Srebrenica crystallized a truth understood only too late by the United Nations and the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a moral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever. END QUOTE
I hope that you will recognize the value and importance of this input in order to avoid future reports, of which there are already way to many, that lament the failures of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I again wish to express my appreciation to the international community for bringing brutalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an end. But, while Dayton ended the military conflict, and genocide, Bosnia and Herzegovina today remains as much a moral cause as it was twelve years ago. While Srebrenica will indeed forever haunt our collective history, the magnitude of that experience will only increase if the results of genocide are allowed to stand, and peace and stability will always be threatened."

Speech by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojša Radmanović in Bucharest and Sibiu, Romania 7-8 June 2007 at the Summit of the Heads of State and Other Leaders from the South-East Europe
“CULTURAL DIVERSITY – A BRIDGE BETWEEN CULTURAL HERITAGE AND THE CULTURE OF THE FUTURE”
Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the very beginning, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the organizers and the auspices of this important summit, first and foremost to our host the President of Romania, Mr. Băsescu, the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Koïchiro Matsuura and Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis.
It is a real pleasure to discuss with friends this important and actual topic like the bridges between our countries and nations, unlike the difficult and delicate political issues that represent a burden to the modern world today.
As the introduction to the today s topic, let me recall the visionary words of Robert Schuman, one of the founder fathers of the European Union who said long ago, in the fifties:
“Before it becomes a military alliance or an economic entity, Europe needs to be a cultural community in the very sense of the word“.
Europe is a continuity of different cultures, national traditions, as well as the common civilization values. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country of the three peoples, several various cultures and religions. Metaphorically speaking, Bosnia and Herzegovina, within itself and in the relations with others, signifies a cultural and civilization bridge. Integral part of our identity is to act like a bridge between the East and the West.
Since their settling on these territories, peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina have always belonged to Europe, as well as to its cultural heritage and historical ties and relationships with other peoples and countries. Geopolitically, spiritually and culturally, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Europe. Historical research has shown that in the past there were close connections between the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other European nations and countries. Though being a small country, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been giving noticeably important contribution to the cultural-civilization heritage of Europe on the cultural, scientific, artistic, humanistic and spiritual aspect since the ancient times. That was affirmed by numerous examples. Many famous scientists, artists, writers and culture creators have worked in other European countries. Young artists, students, cultural authors from Bosnia and Herzegovina attended the leading European universities thus making the important ties of our country with the European tradition and cultural heritage.
Bosnia and Herzegovina highly appreciates the special cultural projects for the South-East European countries launched and organized in the past by the European Union, the Council of Europe and UNESCO.
Those projects have essentially contributed to the stabilization of the South-East European countries by promoting the cultural cooperation and exchange between the countries on their way to the European Union.
It was clearly shown from the past that the culture is very important for keeping the peace building a democratic society on the basis of connecting, exchanging ideas and dialogue between the cultural and creative industries, not only on the local and state but also the international level.
Thanks to the organizations of several great cultural events and happenings of the regional and European importance, culture became an important factor of economic and social development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In general process of the post war reconstruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina there was rehabilitation of the destroyed and destructed cultural objects and means. I would especially emphasize the reconstruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar, owed to UNESCO s tremendous contribution. I would like to use the opportunity of the presence of the Director-General of UNESCO to once more express my gratitude on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Inscription of the ancient core of the city of Mostar on the UNESCO s World Heritage List, the very first of a kind in our country, has come as the result of an active policy in the field of preservation of the cultural heritage. There are current activities for nomination more tangible and intangible cultural heritage sites from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the worldwide cultural heritage list.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The right to the diversity represents the basic precondition for democracy of the modern societies.
Existing governments may not only declaratively recognize the existence of many cultures within the same society, but also really respect and support the demonstration and development of a different practical cultural activities and creativity.
This means a cultural pluralism as the authentic way of existence of the different cultures in an equal, tolerant and open relationship.
In the South-East European region and especially the West Balkans live culturally similar peoples. The more the people of the South-East Europe have tried to be different from each other in their linguistic, religious, cultural and historic way looking from aside they seem to be the same. Modern Europe is still looking to the West Balkans as a stereotype and in a negative way, as the place of the constant conflicts and crisis, forgetting the tremendous cultural and historical heritage and artistic production created and developed in this region, without which the European identity of diversity is not complete.
Therefore the culture could be one of the ways for a shared change of the bad image of the West Balkans countries.
South-East European countries and nations should develop and build interactive multiculturalism of the European type. This means free existence of the various autochthonous cultures with shared and common civilization values. This is also the relationship between the different nations and their cultures based on the equality, emphasizing the similarities existing between the close and similar cultures, rather than pointing to the differences.
In the globalization era the cultural identity and cultural autonomy become a validity of key importance for every individual, ethnic and cultural community. From that background there was the resistance of small cultures to the more expressed cultural unification of the world, which represents the direct threat to the opulence of the diverse cultures. In such circumstances the ideal of many minority cultures and groups is a new motto – „Work in global economy – live in local culture“.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me conclude with a symbolic comparison. Ivo Andric, a Croat born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who lived and worked in Belgrade, novelist and the Nobel Prize laureate for literature, once said: “There is nothing more important the human being is making and building in the world, than bridges“.
Building the bridges of culture between our peoples and countries will be our most valuable contribution to the common European future.
Thank you!"
24992,BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić’s address during today’s visit to the Municipality of Višegrad,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=24992&langTag=en-US,2007-06-05,"Deeply believing that the Mehmed-pasha Sokolović’s bridge would soon become an official part of the entire humanity’s heritage, I am inviting you to contribute to such a decision by spreading the truth about its harmony and its documentary value.
BiH Presidency Member Željko Komšić, before numerous domestic and foreign guests, made an appropriate speech, given here entirely:
""Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
Thank you for being my guests in Višegrad, a town known by its people and their deeds worldwide. Today, we want to direct your attention at the bridge, a valuable work, not a mere building. That bridge, which lies on eleven harmonic arches, is a witness of time and a crystal of Bosnia and Herzegovina cultural remembrance. Deeply believing that the Mehmed-pasha Sokolović’s bridge would soon become an official part of the entire humanity’s heritage, I am inviting you to contribute to such a decision by spreading the truth about its harmony and its documentary value.
Mehmed-pasha Sokolović’s bridge in Višegrad reflects, or finds its reflection in power, art or abilities of three important historic persons – its founder – a grand vizier Mehmed-pasha Sokolović, its builder – the greatest builder in the Great Turkish Empire, Koça mimarbaša Sinan and his “biographer” – a Nobel Prize winner, Ivo Andrić, a writer of a well-known novel “The Bridge on the Drina”. In this way, its construction, historic and symbolic values merge into an exceptionality of expression of one of several images that are emblems of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Due to its harmony, beauty and documentary essence, the Mehmed-pasha Sokolović’s bridge belongs to the most important works of humanity.
I believe that I must use this occasion to mention that the bridge had witnessed dark sides of a human mind, or to be more precise, of a human madness, so I avail myself of the opportunity to ask the families of the victims for understanding and support to including this bridge in the World Heritage List. That will be some kind of a monument and a reminder of their suffering, ordeal and pain, as well as of their closest ones.
Mehmed-pasha Sokolović’s bridge – The Bridge on the Drina – like no other similar place in the world, with its beauty, it bears witness to the ultimate human achievements and the deepest darkness of human falls. This bridge, its architecture, history and testimony of crimes and sufferings in the heart of Europe at the end of the twentieth century, meets all the requirements to become proclaimed a world heritage.
Whether the bridge in Višegrad would truly be proclaimed a world heritage during the June session of the World Heritage Committee – we do not know. We expect support to making such a decision from your country’s representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen, Excellencies, dear friends. In a country, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, where we, its keepers, are facing with negation of its identity, the World Heritage Committee’s decision on placing the bridge in the World’s most precious assets, could significantly contribute to strengthening the public awareness of heritage importance and our responsibility to preserve it. This is an opportunity to express my warmest gratitude to the Government of the Republic of Turkey for its decision to ensure funds and, in cooperation with the Commission for National Monuments Preservation and the Municipality of Višegrad, to rebuild the foundations of the bridge and restore its original look. I also wish to send expressions of the utmost gratitude to many of you, dear Excellencies, who have ensured support to re-establishment of more than three thousands of objects of construction heritage in Bosnia and Herzegovina that was destroyed in the war. Our cultural memory testifies about the voluptuous tangle of our diversity and of our European descending. With your support, that wealth is a deposit to offer to the world."""
24889,Speech of the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojsa Radmanovic at the Conference: “South,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=24889&langTag=en-US,2007-05-29,"I would use this opportunity to inform you about Bosnia and Herzegovina's admittance to the United Nations Human Rights Council one of the most important bodies of the world organizations.
Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to be here taking part at this Conference. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our host for cordial welcome and successful organization of this event.
Allow me at the very beginning to extend my congratulations to the President of Montenegro Mr. Vujanovic, on the recent admission of the Republic of Montenegro to the Council of Europe.
I would also like to thank all the countries of the Region on the support Bosnia and Herzegovina has received at the Summit of the South-East European Process of Cooperation recently held in Zagreb which resulted in designating Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina as the seat of the Regional Cooperation Council Secretariat until now known as the Stability Pact of the South-East Europe. Decisions from the mentioned event represented a step forward of the countries of the Region of taking their own responsibility for the future of this territory.
I would use this opportunity to inform you about Bosnia and Herzegovina's admittance to the United Nations Human Rights Council one of the most important bodies of the world organizations.
Membership to the Human Rights Council is of great importance for the implementation of the UN mission throughout the world therefore our country is ready to face numerous challenges. Bosnia and Herzegovina will demonstrate that it is worth the role it has been entrusted with. The membership is recognition for the progress realized in the recent years both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire Region. This fact could contribute significantly in the restoration of the image of the country and the region of the Western Balkans.
Speaking of the relationship between the South-East Europe and European Union, we cannot avoid the challenges through which this Region has gone in the recent past, as well as all the difficulties and impediments that are still standing before our countries on their road towards the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the progress that all the counties of the region have achieved in the last few years, which brought stability and economic progress.
In all these processes it was shown that the prospective of European Union membership represented a strong impetus and motivation for all the countries in the region to undertake necessary reforms in order to achieve that goal.
I can state with great pleasure that our everyday experience confirms that the countries of the Region are fully dedicated to strengthening the good neighbor's relations, peace and cooperation. For fast and successful integration of our region into the EU, it is necessary to have a common attitude and cooperation, in order to strengthen the efforts which every country individually puts into. Continuous strengthening of bilateral relations between our countries should represent the foundations to all future activities.
Bosnia and Herzegovina follows with great attention the situation related to all the open issues in the region, puts efforts in the political dialogue in their resolving and supports all the solutions reached through negotiations on the basis of compromise and European principles and values. Currently the most sensitive issue is the solution of the status of Kosovo and Metochia. We do expect that it is going to be resolved by the agreement between Belgrade and Prishtina with the assistance of the international community so that in the future it would not represent the source of instability for the entire Region.
In the course of last and this year there have been certain stoppages in implementation of required reforms on the way to fulfillment of the requirements for signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement. It has been emphasized several times that police reform along with some others, is of key importance for progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the Euro-Atlantic integration. I would like to express my confidence that the agreement on police reform will be reached soon, which would be a positive signal that Bosnia and Herzegovina has successfully passed this step towards the Euro-Atlantic integration.
We are fully aware that fulfillment of the requirements for joining the EU is primarily in the interest of our country and citizens, in order to ensure a prosperity for the generations to come. It is often forgotten that for the success of the integration, along with the consensus of all political factors in the country, it is also required the consensus between the state and the citizens. The integration of our countries to the European Union must be a collective effort of the whole society for it is dealing with the changes the social and economic relationships in their very essence.
South-East European countries need to try to realize their development prospects within the framework of the Central European Agreement on free trade which should intensify the economic cooperation and trade exchange between the member countries within a new trade space.
There is only one way for the South-East European countries to reach the long-standing peace and stability, and that is the economic development and greater level of mutual integration to the final membership to the European Union.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
According to all relevant assessments, the latest EU enlargement had positive effects on the member countries. At the same time, skepticism has also grown amongst the citizens in some of the EU countries. In the South-East European countries there is a wide-spread feeling that EU, having been busy with the process and the outcome of the future EU Constitution, slowed down the integration of these countries into its structure. Bosnia and Herzegovina expects that EU will keep its door open for all the countries of the South-East Europe, since without them Europe is not complete in its historical, geographical, economic and cultural sense. Regardless of how the internal relations will be regulated within EU, it is very important for the countries of the South-East Europe that the prospective of their membership into the EU will never be uncertain or slowed down.
European integrations gradually and fully transform the destiny of the countries of the South-East Europe and their peoples. Final success on that way requires primarily changing ourselves in order to make the European values - peace, democracy, market economy and rule of law, to become our own values too.
Stable and developed Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country with the three equal peoples belonging to the three great global religions, situated in the very center of the Region can be a powerful bridge between the South-East Europe and the European Union as well as the integration factor in the Region on the basis of a dialogue, cooperation and understanding amongst the religions and the nations.
Joining of the South-East European countries to the EU is a mission which has no alternative, either for us, since we wish to be a part of a stable and prosperous community, or for EU, since the process of enlargement will not be finished until all the countries in the Region become its members.
Thank you!"

CENTRAL EUROPE: CURRENT PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE
Your Excellencies, the Presidents,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to greet you in the name of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and at the beginning to express my sincere gratitude to the host of our today’s gathering - the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Klaus, for his warm welcoming, as well as to congratulate on successful preparations and organization of this gathering.
Bosnia and Herzegovina gives its full support to the activities of such gatherings, because it recognizes multiple possibilities in them to connect countries, to make room for political dialogue, to enhance relations and diverse cooperation between the countries with different levels of social and democratic development.
In BiH, we believe that gathering the Central-European countries, regardless of all the heterogeneity of the countries’ composition and the diversity of their position is a strong instrument for prompting integration processes in Europe and strengthening democracy in these areas.
Central Europe, trough various forms of cooperation with the countries of Central Europe, has brought these countries closer to the countries of the West, simultaneously with the ideas and the spirit of the West that have entered the territory of the Southeastern Europe. On the other side, trough the countries of the Southeastern Europe, the countries of the Central Europe are achieving necessary connection with the Mediterranean countries, which makes the borders and the spirit of Europe expanding.
The cooperation of the countries of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe has significantly decreased the negative effect of a bipolar division in Europe that had dominated by the nineties of the last century, and after having new members from this part of the Central Europe and the Southeastern Europe in EU, the process of building Europe without frontiers has been improved.
Europe without the Western Balkan countries is not complete, so we rightfully expect that the process of admitting new countries to EU would not be stalled or stopped.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
After a decade of conflicts and crisis, the region of Western Balkan experiences stabilization. After several cycles of free and democratic elections in all the regional countries, the democratic authority has strengthened. The countries of the region are undergoing reconstruction toward economic recovery and sustainable development.
In the period after signing the Dayton Peace Accords, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been constantly going trough the process of positive changes that ensure the society’s democratic institutions strengthening.
Early this year, BiH has concluded the technical part of negotiations on the Stabilization and Association Agreement. Our expectations are that in spite of the temporary halts in our way to the European Union, we would sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement by the end of this year, fulfilling the key conditions of the mentioned package of reforms.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we expect the European Union countries and others to invest in our country’s economy more than ever, not based on support and donations from the early periods, but following the market criteria.
Last year, Bosnia and Herzegovina was accepted to NATO’s program Partnership for Peace, which is recognition of an achieved progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as a stimulus for continuation of commenced reforms until the full-fledged membership in NATO Alliance.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has seen a constant progress in the field of security. Establishing an efficient system of border control and building an electronic system of issuing personal documents and having an efficient cooperation with the neighboring countries, we have multiply reduced the scope of illegal migrations from and trough our territory.
Fight against organized crime, human trafficking and corruption has given good results, but continues to be a permanent activity of institutions.
Negotiations on police forces reform are underway, which will establish rational and efficient police structure at the state level based on European standards.
The regional countries that aren’t in Europe are seeking their own forms of cooperation as supplements to the current interregnum until the full-fledged membership in the European Union. I use this opportunity to inform you that it has been decided these days that Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be the headquarters of the Regional Cooperation Council of the transformed South East Europe Stability Pact. I invite all the present countries to give their contribution to the new forms of cooperation, especially in the economic field. Allow me to ask you for help in building the regional road corridor VC, which represents a strategic investment project for Bosnia and Herzegovina, an important section for the Central Europe countries and the shortest road to the Mediterranean.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The South East Europe countries are facing new challenges today.
One of the main challenges is to strengthen democracy in our countries, which should put an end to common historic conflicts, to ensure stability of democratic institutions and promote ethnic and religious tolerance. Stability and progress achieved in all of the West Balkan countries are still fragile. Exclusivity and unilateral solutions continue to be the main obstacle to reconciliation and integration of our countries, regardless of the side they are coming from.
A great challenge for the South East Europe countries, especially the West Balkan, is certainly the negotiations on the final status of Kosovo and Metohia. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a neighboring country, is interested in democratic solutions for these open issues. Bosnia and Herzegovina advocates the solution achieved trough negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina representatives, with a support of the International Community.
The key challenge for all of us will be a reaction to the situation after reaching a solution for Kosovo and Metohia status. Although it is perceived as a final unresolved Balkan issue, Kosovo and Metohia, could be transformed into a longer problem than it appears now, unless a real, right measure of compromise in negotiations is found. Kosovo and Metohia could easily become a precedent that would instigate independence aspirations of other territories.
We rightfully fear that solving these open issues with unilateral decisions, contrary to the international law, based on the precedent principle could slow down the integration process of this region’s countries in the European Union, and create unforeseeable consequences for the entire Europe.
I dare to conclude with a symbolic portrayal. A well-known legend says that a Greek God Zeus stole the beautiful Europe. Today, we are well aware of that fact that Europe means more than a woman’s name – it is an idea that draws us with its strength and dares us to change ourselves for the better.
Thank you."
24746,ADDRESS BY THE MEMBER OF PRESIDENCY OF BIH ŽELJKO KOMŠIĆ ON THE OCCASION OF THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF ADMISSION OF BIH TO THE UNITED NATIONS,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=24746&langTag=en-US,2007-05-22,"Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
It is my pleasure to be in New York this evening, celebrating the 15th anniversary of Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership to the United Nations in the company of friends. On that day, following a democratic referendum, declaration of independence and international recognition by most other sovereign countries, my country established its international identity as an independent, sovereign and united country. This is why I consider the 22nd of May 1992 as one of the most important dates in the history of our peoples. I think that this date is also very special for our friends, the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia, who were admitted into the United Nations that same day and with whom we are closely tied not only by our recent past, but also our present and our common European future.
On behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and my own behalf; this is an opportunity to wholeheartedly thank the friendly nations and their governments, numerous non-governmental organisations, the media and most of all democratic public opinion and millions of anonymous friends who were supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina through one of the most difficult periods of our centuries-old history. I want to express special gratitude for everything the United Nations have done and are still doing for my country.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country where people who share the same roots, who in essence belong to the same civilisation and cultural circle and differ only in terms of ethnic and religious belonging, together form and have for centuries maintained a single multiethnic, multireligious and multicultural society. This society has stood the tests of historical challenges and can offer today's turbulent world its experience. Personally I and many citizens of my country reject the imposed theory of a ""clash of civilisations"". Even though, throughout our history we have faced numerous ordeals, our experience shows that coexistence, tolerance and peace are the basis without which there is no survival or progress of today's world.
This month we are also celebrating the Day of Victory over Fascism, victory over evil which in a changed form and with new protagonists still shows signs of life. I want to remind you that the UN was created to prevent re-emergence of this evil. With pride I would like to stress that my country was part of that assembly which founded this universal organisation and that antifascism is an integral element of our society. We continue to have strong solidarity with other antifascists in the world, despite the efforts by certain forces in our region and elsewhere for revision of the past. This is why I stress the importance of antifascism as an instrument of prevention against any form of dictatorship and totalitarian regime. Today, more and more countries are genuinely committed to peace, among them Bosnia and Herzegovina, which paid an enormous price in order to defend its independence.
Only 15 years ago, the World was sending their soldiers to our country to help us defend our sovereignty, establish peace and stability. Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina sends its soldiers on peace missions throughout the world, as from its own experience it feels obliged to give its contribution to peace and prosperity elsewhere.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is still facing serious transition challenges, difficult war legacy, incomplete state and social infrastructure, serious economic decline, poverty and heightened nationalism which do not contribute to accelerating reforms needed for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a modern and democratic state. My country is committed to it, majority of the citizens want it and I am personally advocating Bosnia and Herzegovina becoming a member of Euro Atlantic structures as the best way forward to permanent peace and stability; not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina but also for the whole region of South East Europe. Political forces in power bear a huge responsibility for blockage of the reform process we need to implement in order to progress towards joining the Euro Atlantic family of peoples. I want to believe that those in power will have the power and knowledge to overcome this situation as quickly as possible; otherwise we will face serious consequences. This is why I am convinced that the work of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not yet complete and we still need friendly and other forms of support to help us on our way to the future.
Allow me to conclude this speech by again expressing my pleasure that we are amongst friends here in New York and in the host country of our Organisation which, together with other countries, unselfishly works on stabilisation of my country. The United Nations remain an irreplaceable framework and deserve full engagement by Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementation of the UN Charter.
Thank you for your attention and you will always be welcome in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

24657,SPEECH OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BIH PRESIDENCY NEBOJŠA RADMANOVIĆ ON THE OCCASION OF THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF SRPSKA AND THE DAY OF THE 3RD INFANTRY REGIMENT ( REPUBLIC OF SRP,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=24657&langTag=en-US,2007-05-11,"This year we mark the 15th anniversary of the Army of the Republic of Srpska and the 2nd anniversary of the 3rd Infantry Regiment ( the Republic of Srpska ) which belongs to the reformed BiH Armed Forces.
Dear President of the Republic of Srpska,
Dear Presidents of the RS National Assembly and the Government of the Republic of Srpska,
Your Exellencies,
Generals, officers and members of of the BiH Armed Forces,
Esteemed families of perished and missing soldiers of the Republic of Srpska,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This year we mark the 15th anniversary of the Army of the Republic of Srpska and the 2nd anniversary of the 3rd Infantry Regiment ( the Republic of Srpska ) which belongs to the reformed BiH Armed Forces.
In this jubilant mood, it truly is a great pleasure for me to attend this ceremony and address the guests.
First I would like to extend my congratulations.
I express my congratulations on the Day of the Regiment to all members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and to all members of the Army of the Republic of Srpska I would like to congratulate their 15th anniversary. This Regiment embodies and fosters tradition, identity and military legacy of the Army of the Republic of Srpska.
Each anniversary, including this one, brings us back to the past, recent or remote history, and gives us necessary reminders.
The Army of the Republic of Srpska was created because Serbian population across the territory of BiH was seriously jeopardized in terms of their survival and national subjectivity. Facing threats and danger, Serbian people created the Army of the Republic of Srpska in 1992, in order to protect themselves and the territory they had inhabited for centuries.
The tragic conflict in BiH claimed many victims among Serbian people, which compels us never to forget that the Republic of Srpska, as a permanent creation, was created with great effort, renunciation and striving of the whole Serbian population, especially members of the Army of the Republic of Srpska.
This obliges us to show constant concern for families of perished and missing soldiers, as well as those who are injured and disabled.
Following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the Army of the Republic of Srpska and other institutions in RS gave a considerable contribution to the implementation of this Agreement, building trust and cooperation between belligerent parties, as well as permanent, sustainable peace in the BiH territory.
As part of general activities aimed at bringing BiH closer to the European Union and Euroatlantic integration, many important and wide-ranging defence reforms were undertaken in the post-war period, and institutions in the Republic of Srpska framed the concept of these reform processes. The process of reforms was complex, gradual and balanced, and it took vision, commitment and patience of all the people involved in order for the process to be successfully completed.
Taking into account similar experiences of other post-conflict societies, and the progress that has been achieved so far, we can say that the reform processes have been conducted successfully.
The evidence of this progrees is the accolade that BiH received last year, when it was admitted to NATO PfP programme, which entails new obligations and requires reaching new standards that full membership in NATO implies.
Furthermore, at this moment, units of the BiH Armed Forces among whom are soldiers and officers from the Republic of Srpska, are deployed in joint peacekeeping units in several missions around the world, thus giving necessary contribution to communal safety in the world.
In the process of reform of the BiH Armed Forces we had to reduce military staff drastically, and many individuals lost their jobs and had to change their vocation. This process stil causes social problems, and we are trying to mitigate its consequences by wide-ranging measures of economic and social policies.
The BiH Presidency reached a decision last year declaring 2006 and 2007 the years of reduction of the BiH Armed Forces staff which is considered to be redundant.
As part of the ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Army of the Republic of Srpska, and the 2nd anniversary of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, delegations of civil institutions of the Republic of Srpska and BiH, as well as military and soldier organizations, will lay wreaths on monuments dedicated to victims of fascism of World War II, as well as perished soldiers and civilians of the last war in many towns and cities in the Republic of Srpska. Two days ago, on May 9, BiH joined other European countries in celebration of two grand events celebrated simultaneously, not by coincidence: Europe Day and Victory Day. This is a place and time to reiterate that peoples in BiH, especially Serbs, gave a considerable contribution to anti fascist battle during World War II, which built the modern Europe. This is something we must not forget, something that we must constantly repeat as a proof of our European political modernity.
In conclusion, we must not in this solemn moment fail to mention hard and unpleasant truth and facts from the last war that was fought in the BiH territory. The war claimed many victims among different peoples, wrecked the country's economy and impoverished many individuals and families. In this conflict many individuals from different belligerent parties committed war crimes for which they must be prosecuted before competent courts.
It is the only way to ensure sustained peace which will take root and prevent the history from repeating. In such peaceful and prosperous future professional soldiers will be loyal guardians of the country and deserving members of democratic society.
Thank you."

Address by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Nebojsa Radmanovic
Summit ­”Long Term Energy Stability – a Prerequisite for Economic Development” in Ohrid, 20 April 2007
Distinguished Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to greet you and to express my sincere gratitude to our host for the invitation to participate at the Summit. It is of a crucial importance for our European future to exchange our experiences and views through the events like this one, as well as to foster more cooperation in all the fields of importance for our people which would result in good mutual relations.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Global process of liberalization and deregulation of the world economy opened the process of introducing the market competition even in the traditionally monopolistic parts of energy sector. As the part of the European family, by the Athens Memorandum we have expressed our commitment for establishing the Regional market in the South-East Europe and therefore gradually ensure the way for integration into the internal energy market oriented towards the European Union, which resulted in signing the Treaty on Establishing the Energy Community of South-East Europe in July 2006. With participation in this process, Bosnia and Herzegovina confirms its determination for energy sector reform, liberalization of the energy market and harmonization of policy with the EU standards. It represents a great challenge and hope for all of us. Our common need is to develop a stable regulatory and market framework which would attract the investors to the energy sector for ensuring the stable energy supply which is of key importance for our economic development and stability.
The basis of the energy system of Bosnia and Herzegovina is made of the electric power sector which is the main development resource. The estimations were that the existing installed power of 4052 MW in hydro-electric and thermo-power stations for production of the electric energy could be more than three times increased by building new hydro-electric power stations and modernizing the existing ones, as well as building new thermo-electric power plants. Especially important is the share in the hydro-energy potentials, which increased the supply safety and environment protection. Given the importance for further development of Bosnia and Herzegovina I will put emphasis to the electric energy sector in the following presentation.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The reconstruction of the electric power sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina was successfully done owing to the significant donation support and favorable loans of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Normal and consistent electric energy supply was established through increased coal production and reconstruction of production and transmission capacities. Electric energy production achieved the pre-war level. The whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was re-harmonized with the Union for Coordination of Transmission of Electrical Energy in Europe (UCTE). Present production of electrical energy satisfies the needs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and about 10% of the produced energy is exported. The three vertically integrated electric power industries, two in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and one in the Republic of Srpska, are functioning successfully thus realizing satisfactory results.
Reforms and development of the energy sector are the high priority for the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Governments of the Entities, the Republic of Srpska and BiH Federation respectfully. Our key goal is to make the legislation related to the electric power compatible to the European Union practice and establish the regulatory framework to create the preconditions for new investments and competition. We see the realization of this goal in further development of the integration in the region and, within it the important part is to establish regional electricity market which will increase the degree of exchange within the region, greater competition and direct foreign investments inflow.
Acting as the signatory country of the Athens Memorandum and the Treaty of Energy Community of South Eastern Europe, I would like to renew our full support and willingness for complete implementation of the requirements from the document.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has already achieved significant results in restructuring the energy sector, establishing regulatory framework in legislative and institutional way, long-term review of development as well as separating production, transmission and distribution of the electricity, in order to avoid reciprocal subventions. The process of electricity market liberalization has started and, as of 1 January this year, the electricity market was liberalized for all the customers with annual consumption of over 10 GWH. As of 1 January 2008, it was planned to enable all the customers, apart from households, a free choice of the electricity supplier, and as of 1 January 2015, to the households as well. There is lot to be done in this dynamic process such as to improve the legislation, increase the activities of the regulatory bodies, liberalize the market, and especially in the environment protection.
Looking into the future, the key challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina and its economic growth was the expansion of the electricity production capacities in order to resolve a long-lasting problem of growing needs in electricity supply in the country and foster the export volume within the regional market. During the last and this year the numerous initiatives have been taken by the Governments of the Entities to attract foreign investors to modernizing and expanding the existing and building new capacities for electricity production. One of the initiatives is the agreement of the Government of the Republic of Srpska and CEZ group on construction of the new thermo-electric power station in the place of Gacko, with installed power of 700 MW, and modernization of the existing one of 300 MW, including the mine. Apart from that in the last and this year in Bosnia and Herzegovina was approved more that 120 concessions for building small hydroelectric power plants. The coal reserves were estimated to 4 billion tons.
The encouraging fact is that there is a large interest from foreign and domestic investors in investing into the electro energy sector including small projects such are small hydroelectric power plants. It is also the challenge for the countries of our region to jointly approach the construction energy capacities. Bosnia and Herzegovina is open for such way of cooperation.
We are sure that this support and determination towards establishing the common energy market will open a great developing perspective to the entire region. I believe that we shall use that chance for the benefit of our people and the countries of the region.
Thank you!"

Your Exellencies,
Esteemed guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great honour to greet you on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It was in Rome 50 years ago, on March 25, 1957, that by signing of the Treaties of Rome foundations were laid for the creation that we know today as the European Union. In this way, the idea of the united Europe that was for a long time a mere dream of philosophers and visionaries came true. Each anniversary is an opportunity to reassess the key ideas of the founders of the European Union and evaluate the future perspectives. It is also an opportunity for the Europeans to consider what kind of Europe they want in the future. It is also an opportunity for the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina to assess their own position on the road to the European Union and give a new stimulus to that process.
The European Union is the unique political creation. It was designed to prevent possible conflicts in Europe, after the horrors of the two World Wars and with the aim of overcoming legacies of fascism in the 20th century. It opened up new horizons for the peoples and citizens of Europe. In today's perspective, we can say that the European Union is the greatest venture and project achieved through selfless effort of men and women who shared the same convictions, courage and determination. Liberty, peace and prosperity are the main achievements which were made possible through creation of the European Union. However, the fact that the European Union eliminated war and use of force as means of resolving conflict in Europe is its most important legacy.
Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Europe geographically, historically and culturally, but it has not yet become member of the greatest regional integration in the world. That is why we are going to re-double our efforts in order to meet the conditions for full membership in the European Union.
We do not have the right to miss the opportunities that are offered, just like the “ founding fathers” did not miss the opportunity to create the European Union when historical circumstances called for such an action. This resulted in a new optimism and trust in common European future and gave a new impetus to Europe's unification.
After all the atrocities that people suffered here, in Bosnia, and all these post-war years of transition and reconstruction, I strongly believe that membership in the European Union would be a well-deserved reward for efforts we made and difficulties we experienced.
What can Bosnia and Herzegovina learn from the process of European association and integration?
The European Union resolved conflict by implementing peace, it replaced desintegration by creating integrations on new foundations, encouraged new cooperation instead of old hostilities and advocated negotiation in lieu of force. Instead of forcible unification, existing cultural differences and national traditions were acknowledged, as well as common values. Equality for all nations was accented as opposed to domination of one nation.
Messages and lessons from the European integration can serve as a guide for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bearing in mind that there is a basic consensus expressed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, starting from the majority of citizens to political representatives of different political parties, that we all want to gain membership in the European Union, we must build a two-way road: one that will lead Bosnia and Herzegovina to Europe, and another, which will bring Europe to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let me make a comparison between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union. The process of the European integration and unification was made possible in the favourable climate, when a common awareness developed of the need for democratic dialogue and mutual trust. There is also one more resemblance between the European Union and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not by accident that the main visionaries behind Europe's unification lived in border areas and multinational countries which were destroyed by national and interstate conflicts. Only this kind of experience and common awareness could have produced the need for peaceful unification of people on the broader ground.
That is why solutions for Bosnia and Herzegovina must be sought within the framework of European tradition.
What we need in order to find sustainable solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina are dialogue, consensus, patience, mutual respect and equality of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We must remain committed to the set aims, including the constitutional reform, acceleration of economic development, refugee return. We must also take care of socially threatened people, bring war crimes suspects to justice and start the necessary procedures and build institutions in order to ensure equality for all the peoples and citizens, etc.
Ladies and Gentlemen, let me recall the words of one of the visionaries of the European Union, Robert Schuman:
“ Depending on the circumstances surrounding its creation, Europe will be more or less complete. Will it ever be complete? No-one can say. This is not a reason for delaying the effort to achieve unification. Action is better than resignation and the desire for perfection is a poor excuse for inaction.""
There is a place for Bosnia and Herzegovina in this vison.
It depends on the efforts that we are making towards this goal.
Thank you"

Address at the Reception in Honor of the Fifteenth Anniversary
of the Independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Respected Excellencies, reputable guests, and dear friends,
It is an exceptional honor to welcome you to the reception in honor of the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically the fifteenth anniversary of that independence. At the referendum held on February 29 and March 1, 1992, over 66 percent Bosnia and Herzegovina’s citizens of all nationalities voted for a sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina paid a bloody price for its independence, celebrating the first three anniversaries under siege and exposed to massive and gruesome war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the very crime of genocide, against the non-Serb population. Two days ago, the International Court of Justice confirmed that, as a matter of law, that the authorities of the then self-proclaimed “Republika Srpska” committed those crimes, including genocide against over 7,000 Bosniak boys and men in Srebrenica, a United Nations “safe area.” Serbia, for its part, was convicted for failing to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide.
It is disappointing that the Court did not accept the undeniable proof that Serbia at the very least was an active accomplice in this genocidal project. However, the Court unequivocally decided that Republika Srpska committed genocide due to the fact that its authorities “had the specific intent to destroy the Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica.”
It is crucial to understand that the Bosniak people see the Court’s limited decision as a sign of prejudice toward Muslims. This feeling is not solitary, and it has to be taken into consideration. During the darkest days of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Richard Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton project, rhetorically asked: “What would the West be doing now if…a Muslim force was trying to destroy two million beleaguered Christians…?” In the struggle for democracy in the Islamic world, the international community must send a message that the determination for a fully democratic system, such as the unquestionable determination of the Bosnian Muslims for precisely such a system, shall be rewarded rather than punished.
It is also crucial to understand that the target were not just the Bosniaks as a people. The authors of the genocide project had the intent to destroy a unique, multi-ethnic culture, built through the millennium of history, dignified tolerance, respect, trust and coexistence among all of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina regardless of their ethnic or religious background. The massive crimes, including genocide, also aimed to frustrate the will of the large majority of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina who, exactly fifteen years ago, opted for a democratic and equal constitutional and territorial arrangements of our country.
The project of these crimes, however, left us a legacy of an ethnic apartheid in almost half of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that is in the portion whose authorities, according to the ruling of the International Court of Justice, committed the most gruesome of all crimes, the crime of genocide.
Such a decision of the Court, then, clearly indicates that the constitutional arrangement that is based on ethno-territorial principles was directly caused by genocide, the massive war crimes and crimes against humanity. This ruling, hence, mandates that the results of genocide be nullified, and that is possible solely through the adoption of a completely new constitution which will create a democratic system of government in accordance with the multi-ethnic character of Bosnia and Herzegovina that existed prior to genocide.
Namely, international law places an obligation on all countries of the world:
1. Not to recognize as lawful the situation created by war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of genocide; and
2. To cooperate with other States in the application of measures designed to eliminate the consequences of such crimes.
It is, hence, our responsibility and an obligation of the international community to undertake specific measures aimed at nullifying the results of these crimes and to persevere in that struggle.
Primarily, those measures include:
1. Immediate establishment of a special status, outside of the competencies of any of the entities, for Srebrenica and the other Eastern Bosnia municipalities from which the victims of genocide hail;
2. Immediate effectuation of a full and self-sustaining return of all exiled victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of genocide;
3. Immediate adoption of the law prohibiting genocide denial and securing the most rigorous and the most comprehensive application of that law
4. Immediate change of the Citizenship Law whose discriminatory dual citizenship provisions represent a direct continuation of the project of genocide and ethnic cleansing;
5. Constant collection of new evidence which undeniably exist in Serbia’s secret archives and which prove the direct involvement of that country in the crime of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all with the goal of a reopening the case before the International Court of Justice within the allowed ten year period.
6. Adoption of a completely new constitution which will, in accordance with the Decision of the International Court of Justice and with the principles of international law, completely annul the results of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide on which the current ethno-territorial constitutional arrangement is based; and
7. Final return of a truly multi-ethnic character of Bosnia and Herzegovina in every corner of its territory.
The international community, including the United Nations under whose protection Srebrenica was during the genocide, are obligated under international law to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina with the implementation of these goals. Our duty, in the meantime, is to also work on the betterment of the economic and social situation in our country with the final goal to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s independence in a modern, prosperous, fully democratic, multi-ethnic society which will fully annul the results of genocide in every corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Address by the Chairman of the BiH Presidency Nebojša Radmanović at the session of the Political Directors of the PIC Steering Board, Brussels, 26-27. 02. 2007
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Opinions on further role of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina are different, both between the political parties as well as among the citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina also has no unique attitude regarding the matter.
Therefore, let me be allowed to express my standpoint as the member of the BH Presidency on this important issue for the future of our country.
At the very beginning let me begin: Owing to the great joint efforts of the international community, local authorities and civil society, Bosnia and Herzegovina has realized a great important progress in the post-war period, which reflects a positive example comparing with other similar crisis regions in the world.
The mandate of the international community that in the past eleven years resulted in numerous advantages, and has helped Bosnia and Herzegovina to stabilize, consolidate and start towards development, on the other hand it has created total dependence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the international community in political, economic, military and administrative way, which resulted in negative consequences in neglecting domestic political potentials in overtaking their part of responsibility for the destiny of our country.
The current status of the Office of the High Representative does not open the space for credible and responsible political elites and civil society capable to leading Bosnia and Herzegovina towards the European Union.
Each prolongation of such a status of the OHR in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Bonn powers, keeps the country under the supervision and dependence.
Bosnia and Herzegovina must pass from the status of the international politics object to the status of an authentic subject and creator of its own position in the world.
Bosnia and Herzegovina must be a partner to the international community rather than just a satellite, and it is able to achieve that, should it be given an adequate opportunity. One of the ways is to cease the present mandate of the OHR and its role.
The Office of the High Representative of the international community has exhausted its role in Bosnia and Herzegovina formulated within the Dayton Peace Agreement. The very example is the mandate of the present High Representative, which has provided the space for agreement of the domestic political powers’ representatives, which has proven to be very useful in practice.
Domestic politicians and citizens must be given the opportunity to build their country themselves with the help of the international community on the widely accepted principles of the European standards.
The international community should stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the role of an advisor which is most welcome and necessary.
Transformation of the Office of the High Representative into the Office of the Special Representative of the European Union would confirm that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made a significant progress in the reform processes and that the time has come for the domestic politicians to undertake the responsibility for further leading of the country.
All the results that the country has achieved so far, as well as the oncoming reforms, simply require the cessation of the OHR mandate and the abolishment of the High Representative’s the Bonn powers, if the progress of the country towards the European integrations is desired.
The country that strives to become a member of the European Union may not have any administrative structure above the democratically elected representatives and legal constitutional-political institutions.
The forthcoming reforms that Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing, should be a result of the agreement between the elected representatives of all constitutional peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and should aim at the common progress of the country towards the European future.
Thus the greatest responsibility lies on us, politically elected representatives of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our visions, understandings, patience and courage to face the truths, personal and collective delusions, shall influence the speed and tempo of our progressing in the future.
Thank you!"

In his address to the PIC in Brussels, Dr. Silajdžić emphasized that Bosnia and Herzegovina had no alternative to its Euro Atlantic integration path.

First of all, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs a new Constitution. A Constitution which would restore its multiethnic character which took centuries to build.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has great potential which can provide better life for all its citizens. However, current constitution system in Bosnia and Herzegovina divides its economic space and prevents it from fulfilling its full potential. Therefore, it is necessary to remove all the obstacles in order to create a single economic space and provide prosperity for all the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A unique education system is also essential for building a sound democratic society in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The dispersed system of education which we have now separates the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and we still need assistance from the International Community in this respect."

Address by the BiH Presidency member H.E. Mr Željko Komšić at the session of the PIC Steering Board- Brussels, 26-27 February 2007
After twelve years of peace in BiH, taking into account our structural complexities, we can make a general conclusion that BiH has taken the right direction of progress and development.
Occasionaly we have certain problems and bouts of stagnation but this can not be considered as the main characteristic of the situation in BiH.
The current situation can be described as a dissacord between “process” and “result”.
Millions of BiH citizens are becoming more and more impatient listening about reform processes and progress, but as we are all aware, there are no final results and their lives remain unchaged.
Objectively speaking, a lot has been achieved, and I do not wish to repeat the well-known phrases which somehow became symbols of progress, like VAT, the reform of defense, OSA, SIPA, CIPS, SBS, etc.
Your Exellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I do not wish to deliver a speech on reasons for this situation. It is obvious that the parties which have ruled in the past 12 years bear primary responsibility for this.
We are all aware that petty daily political and party interests are often more important than issues which can bring about improvement and results.
Even more important is the fact that, as a result of complicated government structure and the heritage of Dayton Agreement, even the slightest sign of lack of political will delays further reforms and blocks them altogether, which might lead to crisis as regards functioning of government institutions.
This “ lack of political will ”, which is necessary for implementation of key reforms which will benefit all citizens, results in unacceptable waste of precious time, which we can not afford.
We can note waste any more time on our path to EU and NATO membership which we are committed to securing. It is even more relevant to realize that we can not waste time wating for “ political will “ which will improve lives of the BiH citizens.
Your Exellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel that, due to the complicated executive, legal and administrative structure in BiH, the Peace Implementation Council should prolong the mandate of the Office of the High Representative in BiH, including reliance on the Bonn powers, until the BiH Parliament adopts Constitution changes and BiH signs the Stabilization and Association Agreement. In this way, the OHR would fulfill obligations stipulated by its mandate and defined by Dayton Peace Agreement.
If Bosnia achieved progress beyond the Dayton constitution, the mandate of the OHR would be terminated.
As long as our structure remains unchanged and the support from Europe becomes more adequate and efficient, we need an institution which can remove the obstacles and obstructions in the reform processes.
Citizens in BiH are tired and they can no longer be hostages to endless “processes ” and “ tranzitions” that produce no specific results and improvements.
I am aware that during decision- making process in this case people in charge will consider external factors, like the situation in the region, the status of Kosovo and EU progress of neighbour countries. However, in Bosnia we have our own perspective. This means that we wish to be part of prosperous and thriving region, not hostages to possible instability which might arise in the region, or artificial internal crisis in politics created by local authorities.
We have a lot of tasks ahead, but it is only by sufficient political will in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as adequate assistance from institutions of the International Community that we can overcome all the obstacles.
Thank you for your attention!"

Today, eleven years after, I stand before you ready to sign the NATO PfP Framework Document on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Dear Mr Chairman,
NATO Secretary General,
Your Exellencies, Ambassadors of the North Atlantic Council,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Eleven years ago my country came out of the war which took thousands of human lives, destroyed our economy, and almost took the future away from its peoples. Today, eleven years after, I stand before you ready to sign the NATO PfP Framework Document on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Is it too little, or too much, is it too fast or too slow for this time? I am not able to answer this question, and it is historians who should pass their judgement on that matter. I am aware of the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina is changing each day, that the changes are positive, and that our country is not the same as it used to be several years ago. This is a big day for BiH, its peoples and citizens.
It has been long since our country indicated its readiness to assume the responsibilities and rights implied by the membership in Euro-Atlantic family of free, democratic countries, thus expressing its determination to join the NATO Partnership for Peace programme. This decision reached by the BiH Presidency was reflective of our willingness and hope for the European future, as well as determination to satisfy the criteria and meet all the requirements through necessary reforms. Internal difficulties that our country was facing, as well as obstacles it encountered in foreign policy were accepted as true challenges worthy of effort and renunciation in order to achieve the ultimate goal.
Government bodies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as our society in general, began introducing fundamental, wide-ranging reforms in the following key fields: economy, defence, public administration, justice, security system, tax system, education, structure of police forces, and many other fields.
The reform in the defence field had a special place and role on the path to Euro-Atlantic integration structures, because of its real significance, complexity, and comprehension.
In short, complex reform processes are aimed at achieving two strategic goals: establishment of functional institutions which guarantee the citizens and peoples of BiH secure and stable surroundings as well as the integration of BiH into Euro-Atlantic structures, especially NATO and the European Union. The PfP membership is one of the first decisive steps on this path.
We owe a debt of gratitude for comprehensive progress and results we achieved to the NATO Alliance: the NATO Headquarters, NATO member countries, and the Headquarters in Sarajevo. NATO stood for Bosnia and Herzegovina with devotion and persistence, and its peacekeeping forces in BiH formed a protective “ shield”, thus creating an atmosphere where
the reforms were accepted as an opportunity and necessity. NATO also encouraged, directed and supported all our reform processes, accepting BiH as its partner.
There are many individuals who put their knowledge, willingnes, and energy in our joint success.We give them our sincere thanks, and they can be essentialy and symbolically represented by the institution of NATO Secretary General.
We will do everything in our power to make BiH a stable and reliable partner, and signing of the Framework Document means more than institutionalizing our relations with the NATO Alliance. Our ultimate goal, which is reflective of general support from political structures and wider public, is the full membership in the NATO Alliance and the European Union.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the same time determined to establish and promote bilateral and multilateral relations in the defence field with all the countries that are interested in such a form of cooperation, which would be based on the principles of mutual respect and cooperation. Active participance in attempts to find the solution, as well as to create the programme at the regional level, shows that Bosnia and Herzegovina is determined to enhance its role and importance in the regional cooperation.
As a NATO Alliance partner, we want to develop relations in all the fields that will render our security and defence system proportionate with today's threats and challenges to peace and stability, and at the same time be able to participate and contribute to the international peacekeeping efforts in the system of collective security.
I would like to express once again my thanks for your invitation. I assure you that we are fully aware that this act is merely a step on the long path and that we are ready for new responsibilities and challenges. We are determined to stay on this path, using all our knowledge, energy and efforts which will lead us to further progress.
In this respect, I would like to confirm our determination to cooperate fully with the ITCY and to take all the measures to bring war criminal suspects to justice. The PfP membership does not diminish or neglect our obligations to the Tribunal. Quite the contrary, it presents additional responsibility and opens up new possibilities and perspectives to strengthen the functional institutions which can sucessfully rise to all the challenges, including this one."

FOREIGN INVESTMENTS AND POLITICAL STABILITY IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
“Ladies and Gentlemen
It is a pleasure to be with you here today. I thank you for inviting me here and for inviting me to share with you some of my ideas in an area in which you are yourselves very much involved in Bosnia as well.
INTRODUCTION
Investments for Bosnia and Herzegovina have always been my priority and, although the times have not always been so kind to Bosnia, I can see the new momentum on the horizon. I believe that Bosnia has a very good future and its economic boom is around the corner.
However, the road to success is not an easy one. The political stability is a key factor in that process and, therefore, we will need a fast-track adaptation to suit new trends which are fast becoming our most pressing challenges. The challenges to offer our economy a real chance of showing its full potential.
Bosnia’s progress is very much dependent on its future strategy on economic Euro-Atlantic integration. Political stability and foreign investments are two core issue which need to be addressed. They are also both inter-linked. Political stability is an essential requirement for attracting foreign investment, however, the investments are those that by default offer stability. Bosnia needs to get its priorities right so that we make sure one thing does not become a hostage of the other.
Political stability is a key driving force in establishing a unified economic space, however, it is the economic recovery and its progress that ensure a long-lasting political stability. Delivering an effective economic policy is important in order to unlock the true potential of Bosnia’s resources.
Bosnia’s at the crossroads between the true progress in the Euro-Atlantic integration and its negligence on the margins of the Western Balkans. It must not allow its backward political forces to stop its future generations in claiming true reward of their economic prosperity. That is why some key political issues must be resolved to ensure the next six months bring to Bosnia what all of its peoples deserve – a firm path towards EU and NATO membership.
The International Community must also play its part in that process. The upcoming meeting of the Peace Implementation Council in Brussels is another opportunity for the International Community to show that Bosnia is welcome in its selected membership. Therefore, we need to unblock the outstanding reform processes with the help of the International Community and move forward to signing the Stabilisation and Accession Agreement sooner than later. International Community owes this opportunity to Bosnia’s people. We are ready to accept the challenge as much as we are ready to face our responsibility in the Peace for Partnership program, recently agreed upon.
Bosnia has been showing strong commitment in its path towards democratisation and outward looking. The improved credit rating is one of the signs that the progress is underway.
DEVELOPMENT
Some Economic Indicators
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina direct foreign investments in our country from May 1994 to June 2006 amounted to just over €2 billion. Foreign direct investment to the Bosnian economy was on the highest level in 2004 with the amount of €618 million. In the first six months of 2006 different investors from abroad invested in our country totalling €107 million.
When foreign investments are divided by the sectors it is visible that €1.2 billion in the same period were invested in production sector, which is 57.2 % of total amount. In the second place we find the banking sector with €337 million, or 16.8 %, followed by trade sector with €144 million or 7.2 %. Tourism, service, transport and other industries cover the remainder of 18.8 % of foreign investments.
Foreign investments divided by investor countries in the same period, between 1994 until June 2006, are as follows:
Biggest foreign investor in our country is Croatia with €316 million, or 15.7 %, followed by Austria with €293 million, or 14.6 %. Slovenia is in third place with €257 million, or 12.8 %.
United States of America is in 15th place on investors list with €20.7 million, or just 1 %. Some indicators show that since 1995 to date, the US have spent more then $1 billion in support of peace process, economic transform, increase of transparency in political and public life, building infrastructure, NGO sector, media and many other useful projects, as well as it largely contributed to the humanitarian aid in addition.
On the other hand, despite the sharp increase in inflation rate following the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT), the Economist Intelligence Unit expects that strong investments and exports will drive Bosnia’s annual average real GDP growth of 5.4% in 2007-08. Moreover, even though the foreign export deficit in Bosnia and Herzegovina is high, at €3.2 billion, the exports have risen by 25% as opposed to the 11% increase in imports. In terms of the trade the Bosnia is in the best position with the United States of America. The US appears to be the only country so far that Bosnia’s trade is not in deficit. Of course to this position big help comes in from the recent sharp increased in activity. In the last 10 months the level of trade with the US has increased by astonishing 90%, according to Bosnia and Herzegovina Chamber of Commerce. This is all a result of an increased activity by the US, not only in trade, but also in other areas, such as, helping young people find their first jobs by establishing a new web portal, as well as a transfer of $8 million to 4 micro-credit funds by USAID. More opportunities will come when the new initiative on CEFTA agreement materialises, which we hope will happen soon. Many opportunities lie with the Small and Medium Enterprises in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We hope that big international companies specialising in mediation will realise the potential in establishing contacts between Bosnia’s SMEs and those around the world. Our problem with the privatisation currently administered at the entity level is hampering the level of activity in Bosnia, which otherwise would have been much higher, however, this gives a lot of advantage to new SMEs. Of course, more effort will be needed to compose efficient and effective SME strategy proposal. The failure to adopt the workable SME strategy is one among other reasons for the decrease in the foreign direct investments (by 4% by mid-2006).
On the other hand the trade with the EU is far the greatest. 70% of all trade in Bosnia is carried out with 5 countries, three of which are from the EU. Again the list of goods exported fits a narrow list. They are mostly from minerals, metal and metal related goods, 40%, while chemicals and wood products account for further 20%.
To single out one sector that performs at an envious level it would have to be the banking sector. The operations continue to grow strongly and total assets have increased to 80% of GDP. There are only 6 banks in FBiH left to be privatised, while most of other banks are owned by foreign banks – current percentage of share of foreign capital stands at 73%.
Overall, the economic growth in the last year was recorded at 5.5%, even thought its mainly based on raw materials and related manufacturing. More diversification and increase in value and prices should help the figures grow even higher. Of course, the major contributing factor will be the straightening the countries institutions so that the legislation does not block the growth but rather serves to stimulate it.
State strategy for economic development
First and most important step for Bosnia and Herzegovina is to define State strategy for economic development.
- What is going to be the main focus of our economic development?
- How to be recognised in the world?
When we define our goals, all other steps will follow that decision. We have to apply strategic marketing management and try to manage our country as a corporation. There are lot of discussions in Bosnia about economy, our potential, chances, and resources which can bring a better life for all. We can often hear that Bosnia has good chances for economic growth if it develops and invests in energy sector, tourism, wood industry, healthy food production, and, of course, construction of corridor 5-c. In the last few years a development of computer industry has also showed very strong growth. In 2002 there were 200 companies in this sector. In 2005 that number jumped to 2,587 companies. A very interesting point here is that 70 % of these companies are partially or completely owned by Bosnians.
When we define strategic directions of our development we will present our projects and attract foreign investments. Based on our goals of strategic expansion we will need to build our infrastructure across the spectrum.
State marketing: Proactive managing of state image
Promote Bosnia and Herzegovina and its resources. Bosnia needs to be recognised as attractive tourist destination and good place to invest capital in.
How is Bosnia’s image supposed to be recognisable? What are the Bosnia’s recognisable features?
- Switzerland, fore example, is recognised by secured banks.
- Bosnia’s trademark is in tourism, healthy food, multi-cultural monuments, huge energy potential.
Recent CNN promotion of Bosnia and Herzegovina is good example of our changing marketing strategy in the series of short promotional clips - “Enjoy life in Bosnia”.
Targeted investment projects
Bosnia needs stable political system, good economy, modern infrastructure so that we build strong platform for progress. What are some of the forthcoming challenging and optimistic projects?
Corridor 5 – C
Every one is talking about construction of this very important European highway. This project has to be approached seriously and professionally. We must not make the same mistake twice. The initial project proposal by American Bechtel and Turkish company Enka was a missed opportunity. Had we taken it up, we would have been well into the building of one of the most important corridors which would link north border of Bosnia to the Adriatic Sea. Today we have to approach that project with more conviction and remove all administrative and political obstacles and start with the construction. Everyone is aware how this project can push economic growth forward in a number of sectors. This project should be our common goal and it should show our unity, and not just ours but also of our neighbours. All people in our country are expecting that. We are sure that we can bring the investors who will be able build this highway.
Energy sector
This sector holds a great opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina as well. There is huge competition in the region for it. We cannot be late in this competition. Europe needs additional energy production. Our country can offer that energy, because of our great resources. We have enough space and potential to built new hydro and thermo power plants. Our government has received some offers by a number of large foreign investors and we hope that some of them will materialise. It is important to ensure the environment is protected, the competition is transparent and the investment is in the best interest of Bosnia’s people. Also, a number of world banks have expressed interest in contributing to the financing of this project as well. The energy sector is believed to have the potential to attract few billion Euros of foreign investment and we will commit our best efforts to see this come through.
Tourism
Before the war of 1990s Bosnia was recognized throughout the World by hosting 14th Olympic Winter Games in 1984. It is time for another fresh positive image of Bosnia in the world. Bosnia still has beautiful Olympic mountains throughout its territory. Winter sport resorts at Jahorina, Igman, Bjelasnica, Vlasic, Kupres and Trebevic offer unique beauty and potential for winter tourism. Besides winter tourism, our country can offer heritage and religious tourism. Four main religions: Islam, Catholicism, Christian-Orthodox and Judaism meet each other in this country. Those attractions can be interesting for many regional and international tourists. Besides mentioned possibilities there are beautiful rivers and other untouchable areas of Bosnian nature which can be attractions for many visitors. This sector can develop and attract investors to build modern hotels and resorts, which can bring billions to the Bosnian economy. Tourism will be one of the priorities of our development in the future.
Incentives for Foreign Investments in BiH
Firstly, the main tax incentive is a 5-year tax deduction relief for foreign investors with 20% or more share of company assets, plus a 100% tax relief for the re-invested profit of the same business.
Secondly, for the politically averse investors who are concerned about transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and civil disturbances and denial of justice, the availability of the political risk insurance offers peace of mind. This type of insurance is available through the European Union Investment Guarantee Trus Fund for BiH, which is administered b the Mulitlateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which is a member of the World Bank Group. In addition, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) also provides political risk insurance for investors. However, the recently improved credit rating score given to BiH by Moody’s means less concern for the investors in respect of political risk.
Thirdly, many countries have signed agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina on avoidance of double taxation, however, not the United States of America, unfortunately.
Fourthly, many foreign investors see a lot of advantage in establishing their businesses in one of several Bosnia’s duty free zones, which have many advantages in relation to taxation.
On the other hand, Bosnia has many riches and they are not just its natural resources (energy, mines, tourism). Bosnia also has young and well qualified workforce. This is one of its great assets, especially considering that shortage of skilled labour is a big problem with which many EU countries are facing themselves.
SUMMERY
Our economic strategy is full recovery of Bosnia’s potential. The path towards Euro-Atlantic integration requires strenuous work on the reform process. Partnership for Peace membership means much more responsibility for us, however, the investments are needed in Bosnia and we will work hard to make sure those responsibilities are taken seriously. The SAA agreement is also needed to help boost Bosnia’s hope for the better future and simultaneously help the democratic progress as well.
We need the International Community not just as the critic of our shortcomings but also as our partner – partner that will endure our political complexities and help us transform our politically fragmented mind-frame and steer it towards building more stable democracy.
Everyone understands that it is the economic stability through the participation of the foreign investments by which Bosnia sees its stability improve. The will of the political leadership across the international spectrum is needed to help Bosnia’s transformation.
Our economic priorities are building our infrastructure, such as highway – corridor 5c -, which will not only help Bosnia’s economy, but it will also open the door for more democratisation and building a stronger civil society.
Exploring our energy sector, such as construction of the electric power plants, will enhance Bosnia’s competitiveness on the open market and, thus, improve our export capabilities. This will in itself help increase the employment rate as it will open up other opportunities in the mining sector and others as well.
Eco-tourism is still awaiting its recovery and we hope to achieve significant developments there. More winter sports, mountaineering, sightseeing, thermal baths, beach snorkelling are just some of the attractions of Bosnia’s tourism potential.
In the end, we ask for the extended presence of the International Community in Bosnia and to help us establish Bosnia on the firm path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. We welcome its assistance in all sectors of our political reform. We urge the political leadership of the International Community to exert all the necessary political pressure here and abroad to secure Bosnia’s irrevocable process of EU integration. We still need some strong presence of the International Community through the Office of the High Representative until we are securely on this path.
Last but not least, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time. Thank you for listening and I hope you will yourselves play a part in Bosnia’s new phase of economic recovery."""

“Your Excellencies,
Gentlemen generals, officers non-commissioned officers, soldiers
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to address you, in the name of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the Chief Ccommander of the Armed Forces, on the first anniversary of the established Bosnia and Herzegovina Armed Forces Day.
Celebrating December 1st represents a lot more then simply an act of our joint memory of the process of establishing the armed forces. It is, we have to point it out today, a very painstaking, work and agreement-filled process and by itself, it represents an important step.
That successful job, both amply and with high quality, was filled with efforts and knowledge of a large number of people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a help and impetus of a part of the International community. At the same time, that act of BiH Armed Forces establishment sent out a message that if there were a readiness and concerted actions of all the subjects equally, there would be a success.
Excelling in reforms in the area of defence that has gone the farthest and that is something that should please us, is a strong and positive message from Bosnia and Herzegovina. If that could happen in the area of defence and security, i.e. exactly where it is reasonable to expect the biggest problems after the end of the war, then we can rightfully hope to see progress in other areas as well. The best confirmation of our joint efforts in this area is an invitation for Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the NATO program”Partnership for Peace”.
Naturally, something like that requires a great effort and will on the part of the debate participants as well, and the sincere wish to seek solutions that would be in the interest of all the subjects. I sincerely hope that trough these processes, we have learned something, which would allow us progress in other areas.
Precisely due to all achieved and today, the Armed Forces Day, I pay my tribute to all the active participants in the reform processes. I am convinced that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Defence and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Armed Forces, based on the democratic principles and cooperation, would do everything to grow Bosnia and Herzegovina into a country where everybody would feel equal and contented.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We will remain in the reform process continuum as long as the main goal is not fulfilled, which is dimensioning the armed forces in accordance with the country’s realistic opportunities, in the function of its foreign policy of developing friendly good-neighbourly relations. The neighbours of Bosnia and Herzegovina share that orientation, and the goal of every country in the region in which we are located, is the Euro-Atlantic, economic, political and military integrations."

“Comrades,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
Dear citizens,
In the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, ZAVNOBIH is one of the most important events, whose decisions unrepeatably confirmed the historic and political individuality of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a State union of the Bosniacs, the Serbs, the Croats and all other peoples living in it.
In blizzard, great winter and storm, during the German occupation, on November 25 1943, 247 delegates, heroes, members of all peoples in BiH, hungry and frozen, broke trough to reach the first session of ZAVNOBIH in Mrkonjić Grad and there, they laid foundations of a new statehood of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After 480 years of Bosnian country’s kismet, in 1463, on this day, 63 years ago, the foundations for statehood of BiH were laid again, guaranteeing the equality to all its peoples.
It is beyond dispute that the ZAVNOBIH is a cornerstone of a modern, up-to-date statehood of BiH, but at the same time, is it a model pointing at ways in which we could live happily, not just together.
I believe that ZAVNOBIH is one of the most important dates in the history of BiH. It has established one free, sovereign country, an equal community of all its peoples and citizens. Without those principles, of course, there can be no State in these areas.
BiH has undergone a lot since the ZAVNOBIH times ‘till today, something due to certain enemies, something due to certain politics.
The fact that certain structures of authority, still performing these duties, negate that, tells us that in fact they want to use the position of BiH State and to negate it at the same time.
I remind you that there are still members of the fascist ideologies that do not acknowledge BiH today, just as they didn’t acknowledge it then. Today, as in the World War II, members of these ideologies lay claim on BiH, calling it Serbian, Croatian or of Bosniacs. There are still certain forces that are against Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are trying to equate the credits of antifascists and patriots and members of various criminal traitorous formations. That will not happen.
I would like to reiterate that the conditions for holding ZAVNOBIH were created thanks to BiH antifascists – the partisans, and we should not and will not ever forget it.
Thank you!”

Welcome speech
of Zeljko Komsic, Member of BiH Presidency,
marking 63rd anniversary of ZAVNOBIH
Sarajevo, 24 November 2006
""Councillors of the National Antifascism Council of National Liberation of BiH (ZAVNOBIH),
Comrades,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Excelencies
Dear friends,
Honoured guests,
Respected citizens,
We are here today to remember and officially pay tribute to this congress which took place 63 years ago; this event was a turning point in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina and represents foundations of today's BiH.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country of peoples and citizens that are all equal, is our only homeland, built on centuries' old traditions of cohabitation and tolerance between nations, cultures and religions. BiH antifascists and patriots fought for and defended those values. We must nurture and foster them for our diversities are our wealth and not our shortcoming.
As a member of the BiH Presidency I myself, like most of us in BiH, am proud that a CROAT, JOSIP BROZ, remembered by his alias TITO; at a meeting in July 1943 with the leaders of the National Liberation Movement, Rodoljub Colakovic and Avdo Humo in Kladanj, initiated and convened the first session of the National Antifascism Council for National Liberation of BiH (ZAVNOBIH). His conviction was then and always remained that BiH must be an equal unit within the impending state union.
On November 25th, 1943, for the first time in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, representatives of all its peoples gathered and took a political decision which was in their shared interests. This was a historical turning point. Bosnia and Herzegovina was given back to its peoples who only as equals could choose their destiny. This is why 25 November 1943 is one of the most important dates for Bosnia and Herzegovina and its history. It is the day that marks Bosnia and Herzegovina’s return to its true self.
Before then, the destiny of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been decided in the European centres of power; Berlin, Paris, London and Moscow but also in Belgrade and Zagreb, without listening to the voice of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dear friends,
As its name states, ZAVNOBIH was the assembly of the Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s antifascists from all its peoples. It is a fact that the leaders of the Antifascist movement were Communists. At the same time, however the majority of these antifascists and patriots were not members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.
Equating antifascism and communism is a blatant political and historical error which sometimes turns into a naive attempt to blame antifascism for the mistakes, abuses and failures of Communism. It is an attempt to diminish the importance of antifascism and call into question its universal character. Antifascism is a movement much larger than Communism. Communist movement was simply part of the Antifascist movement.
So, antifascism is not the same as communism, and even less like bolshevism. But in our case, let me reiterate it, the communists were leaders of the antifascist movement and this is a historical fact. If anyone because of Communism
wants to negate or erase antifascism from the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then he is not on our side.
I would like to remind you that there are still followers of fascistic ideologies who neither then nor now recognise Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the Second World War, the followers of such ideologies claim Bosnia and Herzegovina to be Serb, Croat or Bosniak. There are still forces that are against Bosnia and Herzegovina and they attempt to equate the achievements of the antifascists and patriots with acts by followers of various criminal traitorous formations. This is unacceptable.
ZAVNOBIH is a milestone of contemporary, modern statehood and a model that shows how Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and other peoples in BiH, can live together. We must not forget that after the Second World War, all federal units obtained their status in the newly formed state union based on national criteria.
The only exception was Bosnia and Herzegovina which did not acquire its federal status inside Yugoslav union according to national criteria but as a historical community of peoples who for centuries had lived together.
BiH antifascists and patriots fought for and defended those values more than sixty years ago. They defeated followers of fascistic traitorous ideologies. So will we, now and in the future.
Principles determined in ZAVNOBIH have a long lasting historical value and by respecting those principles Bosnia and Herzegovina can integrate into Euro-Atlantic structures. This was an event which not only confirmed the continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina's statehood but also its multi-national character.
With regard to an appropriate way of marking the Statehood Day; that is, disregarding it in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would like to underline the following:
I consider the day of signature of the Dayton Peace Agreement as an important date in the recent history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which should be marked in a dignified way, but the twenty-fifth November – the day when ZAVNOBiH took place and when key decisions were taken – I personally consider it to be undisputedly and unreservedly the only Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina's statehood.
Nobody should ever forget the hundreds of thousands of antifascists and patriots from all peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina who more than six decades ago heroically gave their lives, fighting and defending the principles of ZAVNOBiH and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Having in mind the enormous and inconceivable number of victims, I consider any attempts to diminish and deny the importance of ZAVNOBiH as anti-civilisational and unacceptable.
Especially, I do not accept some quasi-intellectual discussions and polemics on the importance of ZAVNOBIH and its heritage and even less so for some day-to-day political interests and unprincipled petty politics.
As we live in the same country, and as we are the citizens of the same country, the minimum of civilised behaviour and conduct should allow this day to be a common public holiday of all its citizens.
It is possible to discuss and debate whether it is the twenty-fifth November, or some other date. I do hope that very soon, all Bosnians and Herzegovinians will have at least one common holiday and celebrate accordingly. It is high time that people stopped saying that Bosnia starts where logic ends.
Dear Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina
After all adversities, enormous hardship and suffering which befell us in the recent past, it is up to this generation to pave the way to a common future. It will not be easy. We have to confront every evil and look to the good. Free, democratic and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina is our wish and reality. It is the firm interest and a necessity for all its citizens.
Without respect for each other, any kind of prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina is unthinkable. Simply saying, no one people can exist without others in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After all I have said; I would like to emphasise that nobody but ourselves can normalise our relations.
We, as a society, and also as individuals, must have the strength to face the truth of the past; we must wish and be willing to learn from our past and to acknowledge it. I think that our gathering today might serve this purpose.
Finally, we have gathered here to underline that today's Bosnia and Herzegovina must find the strength for courageous steps forward and bold moves, when its fundamental commitments and its future are at stake.
The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in a community of equal peoples, a society of equal citizens where differences are our richness and where no one has more or less rights than the others.
Without facing the truth about our past there will be no future. BiH antifascists and patriots fought for the principles of ZAVNOBiH and for our future more than six decade ago. We are fighting today for the truth about them and their battles in order to give them the place they have earned in our history, and ensure for all of us a happier future.
Thank you"""

A greeting speech
by Željko Komšić, the BiH Presidency Member
at the Ninth regional association conference on missing person from
the territory of former Yugoslavia
Brčko, 24.11.2006
“It is very difficult for me to talk at these gatherings, where you can practically feel all our individual tragedies in the air.
The amount of the suffered evil is such that any kind of revenge would represent only a small compensation for what you had gone trough. The only thing that gives strength and evokes spiritual peace to us all is something called JUSTICE AND DESERVED PUNISHMENT.
Regardless of how slow it may be, only justice, at least for a bit, can restore our faith in life and future. Although indifferent and satisfied with the crimes that they have committed out of inexplicable, animal impulses, only justice and deserved punishment is what the criminals of all kinds and profiles makes restless and agitated, because they know that somewhere, someday, they will get their deserved punishment.
The truth must be known, and the past must not be suppressed, especially not forged. Every attempt of distorting the truth is beforehand condemned to failure and everyone of us must face the truth about ourselves, and only then about the others.
As I have mentioned earlier on several occasions, I will continue to fight and I will not hesitate or get tired trying to help in clearing up the destiny of those still considered missing across BiH – on all sides.
Tens of thousands of misfortunate families across BiH must finally find their peace. Finally, they must be able to light the candle and pray for their dearest in a dignified and human manner.
This country must finally stop being a country of missing persons and a land of hidden and dislocated mass graves! Criminals of all kinds and profiles will not walk freely and enjoy the benefits of their crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Justice and punishment are only two words that can follow what has been the worst crime in Europe since the World War II. For me, everything else is unacceptable, at the cost of life.
Against evil and villains, for justice and punishment of evil, I have fought all my life. I promise you that I will consistently do it in the future as well, together with all of you. Finally, I am just one of you.
Thank you.”"

at the ceremony on occasion of celebrating
the 11th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement
“Your Excellencies,
Esteemed guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to greet you in the name of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Celebrating the eleventh anniversary of signing the Dayton Peace Agreement is an opportunity not only to sum up the results we have achieved since the end of the tragic conflict in these areas, but also to turn to the plans for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the reason is of festive nature, it is no time for celebrations and festivities; not because we do not know how to be joyous or because we do not have a reason for celebration, but because there is a lot before us to be done.
From where we stand now, the Dayton Peace Framework Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a great success. Today, it is absolutely clear that the recent history of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be divided into times before and after Dayton. Our awareness of it will become clearer as we become more and more distant from it. As much as it has been criticized for creating new administrative divisions, untypical constitutional solutions, slowing down the decision-making processes and similar, all that will always be considerably less than what it has brought: peace, freedom of movement, democratic development possibility, trust reconciliation and prospects for the future. Those that blame the Dayton Agreement for all our current difficulties today seem to forget that it has created an opportunity to tackle them together at all.
Our efforts in the future must be pointed in the direction of relation development between peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina that would stimulate a new optimism and trust in the European future. Everyone is invited and welcomed to join that path. No one is freed from an obligation and responsibility to act in general course of our European future. If every man in Bosnia and Herzegovina does everything he can, if all of us do our best, this country will walk more courageously and more decisively toward development and progress.
We have worked hard in the previous period, but there are plenty of unfulfilled tasks and goals that needed to be achieved. For conducted reforms in the area of defence, armed forces and security, administration of justice and state administration, economic changes, creation of unified economic space, fiscal politics, achieved progress in cooperation with The Hague and so forth, we rightfully expect to be rewarded with an entry in the Partnership for peace program, understanding for our position for joining CEFTA, visa regime facilitation for our citizens and with other benefits of the international community.
Upcoming transformation of the Office of the High Representative into the Office of the Special Representative of the European Union, regardless of what the outcome might be, is a confirmation that Bosnia and Herzegovina has done a significant progress in the reform processes and that the time has come that the domestic politicians are to take over the responsibility for leading the country, Bosnia and Herzegovina is moving with giant steps toward the European and Euro-Atlantic integrations. On that road, we need to turn our differences into our advantage and point all our energy and knowledge at revitalisation of destroyed economy and dealing with social matters. In order to achieve it, we will still need an unselfish help from the international community.
However, we mustn’t delude ourselves that we have completed everything. We mustn’t shut our eyes before the evermore spread poverty, growing intolerance, and denied national equality of our peoples.
We must return dignity to the intransient virtues and values of life, such as personal integrity, living on one’s work, belief in oneself and one’s aptitudes, affirmation of capable not suitable, equal possibilities for all people, solidarity for the weak and frail, etc.
Upcoming changes before Bosnia and Herzegovina need to be a result of democratic agreement and cooperation between the elected political representatives of all constituent peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not imposition of any kind. All changes should aim at stability, equality and democratic and economic development and a general progress of country toward the European future.
I don’t see a better guiding principle to be a road sign for our path to future then a famous Hindu leader and a thinker Mahatma Ghandi:
“Be a change you desire to see.”
We will certainly succeed.
Thank you.”"

at the third Regional Economic Forum for South East Europe
Miločer - Montenegro, November 15-16, 2006
“Dear presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to greet you and at the same time, to thank the organizer for inviting me to participate in this Forum’s work. It is crucial for our European future to exchange experiences and encourage cooperation in all areas of importance to our citizens as well as mutually good relations trough these or similar gatherings. That is in our interest.
Our goal is certainly to achieve continuity of economic growth and a better life of citizens, while simultaneously accepting and achieving the European standards. There can be no successful development without competitive economy. We are aware that there can be no increase in competitiveness without quality macroeconomic environment, efficient institutions, developed infrastructure, latest technologies, quality microeconomic environment, clear strategy for developing economy and enterprises.
Building competitive economy represents a difficult and complex process that requires constant work, which is confirmed by experiences of developed and successful transitional countries. The today’s presentation shows where we are in the overall competitiveness. Every country’s position can be evaluated by comparing it with other.
I am pleased that Slovenia and Croatia have high rankings in competitiveness. That is a challenge for us, as well as a hope that by following their experiences we would ensure a better position of our economies in the world competitiveness.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is lagging behind its neighbours, especially the developed ones. The reasons for that greatly lie in the past war events, which left marks on its economy and population. I must also use this opportunity to stress out the great support of the international community in reconstruction of infrastructure. Strong investment activity, financed by donations, has contributed to the high post-war GDP real growth rate. What encourages us is the fact that economic growth was also continued after the foreign help was reduced. Parallel to the reconstruction, major reforms of the entire system commenced. Achieved reform results so far are unbalanced in respective sector.
Allow me to turn to some segments of economy, which competitiveness depends upon.
Bosnia and Herzegovina was a success in achieving macroeconomic stability. Inflation was reduced to that of the developed country. Domestic currency – Convertible Mark is stable, with the constant growth of foreign exchange reserves. The fiscal budget balance has been established , thanks to successful tax reforms, and especially thanks to the introduction of value added tax. Fiscal discipline has been intensified due to establishment of Treasury and the budgetary management audit office, so Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to develop a competitive banking sector, including the regulatory and supervisory bodies. Thanks to these reforms, we have established macroeconomic stability, and due to this component, Bosnia and Herzegovina is now highly ranked.
Bosnia and Herzegovina requires faster and a more decisive work in building and strengthening efficient public institutions capable of ensuring greater security, rule of law, respect for agreements, and for stamping out corruption and crime. Previous governments did not pay enough attention to this matter. The position I have recently been appointed to and the party I belong to, will attach special significance, trough system institutions, to building efficient institutions, because we are aware that without good institutional environment that fuels entrepreneurship and competitiveness, there can be no economic growth and development.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is significantly lagging behind in building necessary infrastructure for the European integration and joining the global market. Therefore, we are not surprised by the huge efforts put in by European Union in investing infrastructure in order to ensure relatively equal conditions for development of all regions. The road infrastructure of Bosnia and Herzegovina has become a critical factor for quicker inclusion of BiH economy in the world economy. We will put in efforts to fix the situation in the field of infrastructure using concessions and joint ventures. I use the opportunity to express our readiness to build main road routes, trough joint ventures that would contribute to a quicker development of the entire region.
Due to the insufficient investment activities on the part of domestic sources and a modest influx of direct foreign investments, Bosnia and Herzegovina is technologically lagging behind the world. Realistically, we expect a more significant influx of foreign investments in the following period: due to the privatisation of Telecom, oil industry and envisaged investment in the electric power sector. That will contribute to a further economic development, export increase, modern technology introduction and ensuring new jobs. I am pleased that the neighbouring countries have shown interest in investing in the electric power sector.
To ensure competitiveness, reforms at the microeconomic level are equally important because the wealth is created at that level – i.e. it lies in the competence of the enterprises to produce valuable goods and services efficiently.
We will strive elaborately and systematically to enhance competitiveness in order to ensure a more quality life for our citizens. I am convinced that our economies would become more and more competitive, which would open doors to become recognised by our export, not just import, by production, not just consumption. We can achieve this trough reforms, with a further support from the international community and its financial institutions. I am convinced that we possess enough strength and opportunities to do that.
Thank you!”"

at the 14th session of the Igman Inititative
Miločer – Montenegro, November 16, 2006
“Gentlemen Presidents,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure today to greet the participants of the Igman Initiative session, which in contrast to the previous sessions, is being held in quadrangle, and especially because we are discussing the European perspective of our countries and the European values.
The Igman Initiative mission was very important in the previous period; its visions about the future gave hope; it achieved the unthinkable in the difficult moments; it offered solutions. You are still doing it today, so in the name of those that I represent, I thank you.
I am certain that this topic “Cooperation leads to European values” can and should be discussed from different angles, comprehensively and that this session will be an initiator of many important debates to come that would offer quality solutions.
Cooperation between four countries, which are also each other’s neighbours, is no longer in question. Today, we know that we have had our children’s diseases, we have made successful contacts and we see the results of that cooperation.
The continuation of friendly relations is necessary; the highest bodies are already determined and besides the nongovernmental agencies, the state institutions are working on it as well. Possible small resistance can be ignored and in time will be even smaller.
Overcoming the earlier hostilities is needed – decided the Europeans over a half a century ago. We have reached the same conclusion, and we started to act accordingly. We have not done everything yet, but we must do it. To do it, we need reconciliation, and reconciliation needs truth. Not one, not three, but to jointly establish the truth. It is important to affirm equality as a condition of having joint life in each of the countries, but to affirm equality in interstate relations and in Europe as well.
Current EU members, right after their mutual conflicts, have realized that it is necessary quickly to ensure the revitalisation of national economies. Most of them are the most developed countries in the world. We, living in this area, also realize the importance of economic development, but we cannot manage to go forward in the same tempo.
The third, possibly the most important, and it seems the most difficult principle was turning differences into an advantage. We have often insisted on differences in the past, which led us to difficult and sometimes even hopeless situations. A great part of Europe went trough similar periods and succeeded, just as we did. Their differences have become their advantage. Peoples and citizens living in our quadrangle, at certain points in the past also knew how to use this. That shows that we can do it, we simply have to try harder.
We must find joy in each of our success, wherever it occurs; we need to ask help from each other; we need to help one another.
We are not talking about who is older as a state today, which has progressed in democracy more, and which in economy.
Today, we are not talking about how to go on, how will we be together, how will we help one another; we need that, we can do it, and I hope we will achieve it.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the West Balkan must be included in the future shape of Europe.
In its earlier convocations, the BiH Presidency has clearly advocated the need to build good relations with the neighbours, which you all know. I believe that it is important to say today that the newly elected members of the BiH Presidency, the three of us, in our separate inauguration speeches, underlined the importance of cooperation and development of good-neighbourly relations.
How to walk toward the European values? It seems to me that we must remember the principles that Europe started from in the ‘50-ties of the last century, toward its unification – the today’s European Union.”"

BIH PRESIDENCY CHAIRMAN
Mr NEBOJŠA RADMANOVIĆ
AT THE FORMAL SESSION, NOVEMBER 6, 2006
""Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Excellencies,
Esteemed colleagues, members of the BiH Presidency,
Change of power, regardless of what it might be or when it takes place, is an important step. It gives hope, but awakens fears as well. It is the same all over the world, and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Our assignment is that the change is not important only for a minute; the change must be felt today, and particularly in the future. Everyone in Bosnia and Herzegovina must feel it. This is how we will beat the fears.
According to the current Constitution, the Presidency is the most important institution in BiH. That fact demands seriousness, principles, responsibility, and vision. It is not a good time for evaluation of whether it was like that or not, but the time is right to say today that this is how it should be. That is how I imagine the BiH Presidency Member post must be like.
BiH must take giant steps forward. The question is do we all know where we are going and how. I am certain that the majority in BiH knows that answer. We must become a real part of Europe. The question is do we have a road to take in our vision and do we have enough responsibility, desire, knowledge and will to commit ourselves to this job to its very end. We must ask ourselves “Do we all in BiH want it?”. I believe that the majority feels this way; therefore, I am determined to work in interest of that majority.
The time is right to remind certain people in Europe that descendants of ancient European peoples live here and that they need support in this phase of development. European Union needs to support its southeastern part because of its own development as well.
That support must be well intentioned, flawless, without any hasty, insufficiently planned actions. Mistakes were made in the past, Europe had paid them dearly, and us, who live here, above all.
In order not to repeat those mistakes, we need to affirm certain goals, the BiH internal goals; the same goals that Europe started from toward its unification.
It is necessary to overcome the earlier hostilities completely. For doing that, we need truth, conviction for all criminals, understanding and reconciliation. It is highly important to affirm equality as a precondition of a mutual life; it is highly important to do everything in order to put an end to feeling endangered.
Rapid development of the destroyed national economies is a task, which most of the current EU member countries had realized and fulfilled, so can and must we in BiH. Without it, there will be no survival in this area; without it, we cannot come closer to Europe, and without it, we cannot align ourselves with the developed countries.
Differences, which undeniably exist in Europe, especially in BiH, must not be a source of conflict; on the contrary, that must be an advantage. There was a time in the past when we knew how to use it, I am sure we can do the same in the following period as well.
All that requires knowledge, persistence, patience, and good intentions. I sometimes feel that we mostly lack good will. Every citizen of BiH, notably the elected people’s representatives, must find joy in every success, wherever it may occur in BiH. That is a way to go forward. Truly to have that, BiH cannot and must not be a mother to some of its citizens and a stepmother to others. There must not be important ones and those less important, dearer ones and those less dear among us. Equality is a condition and without it, we cannot go on.
I am convinced that the road to development of BiH, and the Republic of Srpska and the Federation of BiH as its constituent parts, is not hard to find if we are lead by good intentions and if we rely on competent, reasonable and independent people.
Progress needs reputation, and reputation cannot be regulated and it cannot be ordered. Reputation can only be earned.
Achieving it would mean victory over the fear of future; it would awaken the hope in dignified life.
I see the mandate that I have received as an obligation. I have a great obligation to numerous citizens of the Republic of Srpska, who voted for me, but also to those who didn’t. I have an obligation to every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I will fulfil it.”"

“Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Esteemed guests from the country and abroad
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
I speak to you today with a sense of great honour, pride and responsibility for the high function I have just taken.
The elections are behind us and it really does not matter that some of you had chosed different candidates during the elections. I find all the citizens equal and I want to serve you all and our homeland.
I am bounded by the trust of citizens to perform this duty honourably and honestly. Together with you, I will put in all my means, strength and knowledge to make BiH better and different.
I invite all citizens of BiH to support my efforts and convictions that our country must be democratic, civilized and progressive State, a State of rule of law and tolerance, and a State where no one will be discriminated, where everyone will be equal and even.
As a youngest elected member of the BiH Presidency so far, I belong to this country’s generation of destroyed youth and I am fully aware and understand that young people desire better life and most of them want to leave Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I will do everything in order to change it, because we are here not to describe the past and presence, but primarily to defend the future. Hopelessness, lack of perspective and perishing youth cannot be and must not be the future of our children!
We must not allow the past to disable our road to future. However, past cannot and must not be suppressed, especially not forged. Every fight against truth is sentenced beforehand to failure and all of those who do not want to face the truth about themselves and their own past, are nothing but cowards. Courage is to face the truth, first the truth about yourself, then about others.
I will continue to work and I will not get tired in efforts to help clearing up the destiny of those who are even today considered missing – on all sides. Devastating uncertainty about the destiny of their dearest ones must finally come to an end for tens of thousands of despondent families across BiH. BiH must finally stop being a country with missing persons and a country with the mass graves! Notably, BiH must stop being a country where war criminals of every type and profile walk freely! There is no other alternative for me.
The future of this country lies in resisting current fears and those feeding on those fears, those who persist in their own national paranoia and who divide people and territories trying to maintain their own little empires.
As a member of the Croatian people in BiH, I know what it means to be outnumbered. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in all its beauty, is a country where in every part of it someone is in a minority.
I promise that I will fight for full application and affirmation of the basic principle, which the universal idea of the civilized society is based on, and which in fact is an integral part of Bosnia and Herzegovina since its beginning. The principle is: THAT THE MAJORITY IS APSOLUTELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MINORITY.
I will never give up on the full application and resuscitation of that principle in all its beauty and power in every part of our homeland.
I promise that while performing my duties as a Member of the BiH Presidency, I will never be guided by interests of daily politics or narrow- party interests! The only interest that I will advocate and follow is the interest of the citizens of this country, especially the growing generations, our children!
We must finally put an end to the separate education of children of different nationality as a darkest form of mistreating the youngest.
This darkest fascist political maltreatment of children handicaps them beforehand and takes away the normal life, which is in harmony with the universal values of the humanity and modern Europe. In addition, this anti-civilized way of education is mostly advocated by those who do not mind the fact that their children in abroad are receiving their education along with the children of other nationalities, religions and races.
Empty phrases, false promises, i.e. immoral and dishonourable policy on basic ethical values – this country does not deserve this and cannot take it any longer.
I will perform my duty responsibly, honestly and conscientiously. I will represent all the citizens of this country, because you have been my impetus and you have given me a direction how and why to fight in political and public scene.
To reinforce all institutions of the legal state, to respect human and minority rights, freedom of the press, create a stable and permanent framework of market economy and socially responsible State – that is our joint task and duty.
As a Member of the BiH Presidency, I will act in accordance with my constitutional duties against the social injustice, crime and corruption and every form of abuse of power. Before the law, everyone must be equal, regardless of nationality, religion and political conviction, age or sex.
BiH where people would live agreeably, living on their work and work results, where knowledge, expertise and qualification would be valued instead of crime, corruption and ignorance – I want that BiH.
BiH wishes to live in peace and cooperation with its neighbours. We will do everything in our power to make BiH a stable and secure, democratic and prosperous part of the region in its path toward joining the Euro-Atlantic integration.
A democratic BiH, a State of all its citizens, equal citizens, has been and will remain my first and most important goal!
Furthermore, I promise that BiH will remain devoted to fight against global terrorism, which is the greatest evil of modern times, wherever it may be used and regardless of the mask and pretences under which it might be used.
Citizens brought me to this high duty and entrusted me with the function of the BiH Presidency Member; I am here for you and I will work for you in the next four years.
Thanks!”"

AT THE FORMAL SESSION, NOVEMBER 6, 2006
“Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Esteemed colleagues,
These elections have shown that Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready for a full democracy and that the citizens have surpassed the political organization that frames their lives.
The question how to reform the existing system and bring in harmony with the needs and aspirations of Bosnia and Herzegovina is now open, and it needs to be solved with the full participation of citizens and all the subjects interested in the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We need assistance of the International Community in harmonizing the basic principles and norms with accomplishments and practises of the democratic world.
There is not any doubt that the citizens of BiH are determined to join to Euro-Atlantic integration and that on the average, 80% of population supports that road. There are, of course, serious differences in views of the ways and the roads to achieve that goal, and those differences should be tackled patiently, trough agreement and respect for different opinion.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic state with the heavy past. Turning differences into an advantage is a difficult task for us all, especially those entrusted by the citizens during these elections. I hope that we would live up to expectations. Full equality and constitutionality for all on the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an issue, neither is a sovereignty or the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will try to enhance the friendly relations with the surrounding countries. The past teaches us that in this part of the world, it is advisable strongly to hold on to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the neighbours.
Unfortunately, we must admit to be witnesses of an occasional interference in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that the lessons from the past have not been learned well yet.
The best thing to do is all of us to turn to solving our own problems. If we behave friendly, the borders will not separate us but connect us.
The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to be a good neighbour and a constructive member of the European and the World Community.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,
Measure for a true maturity of a society is its humanity, and it can be manifested in relation to those who are having the most difficult time in enduring the life tribulations. Whether those are the families of the killed soldiers or demobilised fighters, pensioners, self-supporting mothers or returnees and their status, property and human dignity, it is clear that responsibilities to them are being fulfilled only partially.
In many cases, their basic human rights are being violated constantly, intentionally and systematically.
The duty of the Presidency, and of all other factors, is to do everything in order to have a more just society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
One of the consequences of the mass violations of all human rights, including the right of life, is what we call a Diaspora. It is enough to say that hundreds of thousands of our citizens are scattered all around the world today.
Their rights, related to return and property are little respected and even less achieved. On the other hand, today that Diaspora represents, trough its potential, the basis for the future in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a real partner in building a modern state.
A lot depends on our stance on Diaspora and to what extent would that potential be used for the purpose of progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Of course, all that is closely connected with education and care for the youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There is no doubt that all these goals are easily achieved with having a strong economy. In the following period, a lot can be done in course of that. The basic obstacle is a system that blocks the potentials of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the divided economic space.
However, in cooperation with the International Community, trough diplomatic missions, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and an active approach to potential investors – it is certain that we could start projects vital to life of every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
All that requires capable people who will have public interest in mind above else, and Bosnia and Herzegovina has that kind of people.
Finally, we are here today because of the will of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We, members of the BiH Presidency, are obligated to respect that will, and I am sure that our friends outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina would also be guided by the same, democratically expressed will and help us in achieving the common goals.
THANK YOU!”"

Reis’l-ulema Dr Mustafa eff. Ceric,
Dear friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Three years have passed since the death of Alija Izetbegovic, the first president of the Presidency of an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On this occasion, we have gathered to evoke the memories and reminiscences of his figure and work. We have summoned his closest associates from the roughest days of defence of our homeland from the aggression, the representatives of certain institutions and the members of his family.
PhD Ejup Ganic, as a member of the Presidency of the Republic of BiH and his first associate, will talk about the persona of late president Izetbegovic and the joint fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As time goes by, the righteousness of Alija Izetbegovic’s way and his vision of Bosnia and Herzegovina as multiethnic, democratic, European country of equal peoples and citizens are receiving more and more confirmation. The name of Alija Izetbegovic will remain remembered worldwide as a synonym for fight for justice, freedom and democracy. All of us, who support such a vision and follow the way of late Alija Izetbegovic, can best prove it by building a stable and prosperous European Bosnia and Herzegovina, where all its peoples and citizens, in its entire territory, would enjoy equal human rights and freedoms."

Mr. Chairman
Esteemed Presidents of States,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
First and foremost, I would like to express my pleasure for participating in the today’s Summit, so please allow me to thank our hosts in Serbia and Mr. President Boris Tadic personally for a cordial welcome and excellent conditions in which this meeting is taking place.
Mr. Chairman,
At this Summit, we are discussing the issues of great importance to overall situation and future of the countries in the region. This is an another opportunity to continue with the practise of open exchange of views on stances and activities directed to further development of security and friendly relations in the region in general. Our everyday experience confirms that the regional countries are decisively dedicated to strengthen the stability and cooperation, in which the dialogue and understanding truly have no alternative, because only in this way, we can examine issues of common interest to our countries.
In regard to the joint fight against organized crime and terrorism, we are encouraged by the initial results achieved in the joint campaign of South East Europe countries.
Confirming, therefore, support from Bosnia and Herzegovina to this I Summit of South East Europe countries, where we openly talk about “fight against organized crime and terrorism”, I wish to emphasize that notably this problem, due to escalation of terrorism over the last few years, has practically shocked the world public.
Today, the world is also under the heavy impressions of terrorist attack in the USA, on September 11, 2001, when the innocent people were killed, and many children among them, as well as during the later attacks in Madrid, London, the school in Beslan, North Ossetia. Obviously, the end of this is not discernible and today, the world lives in fear of new attacks.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The international terrorism and organized crime endanger peace and security of the entire freedom-loving world and not a single country is spared in the process. When talking about South East Europe, we must always bear in mind all the challenges we could encounter on our way to a free and undisturbed development and the Euro-Atlantic integration.
The organized crime and terrorism are common evil that represent means of destabilisation of countries and the greatest threat to peace, stability and in general the development of friendly relations in our region as well.
When talking about Bosnia and Herzegovina in that context, it has undergone some very difficult trials deriving from the times of the tragic war. After the known events from September 2001, as a European country and a member of the United Nations, Bosnia and Herzegovina has joined the extensive alliance of countries that had undertaken emergency measures, internally and externally, in fight against organized crime and terrorism. In that context, the Coordination Team for fight against terrorism was formed and “Plan of activities of the B-H institutions and the Entities in preventing terrorist activities and actions” was reached.
We have instilled determination, conclusions and commitments comprised in the resolutions of the United Nations 1333 and 1373 in those activities, as well as the conclusions and initiatives undertaken by the European Union Council, i.e. those deriving from the Brussels Conference Declaration.
Mentioned programmes of measures are of wide scope and can be summarised to five basic courses of action.
First, legislative measures and activities directed to encircling the legal framework for fight against organized crime and terrorism.
Second, instilled measures and activities related to a higher level of security and protection of civil air services.
The third element are measures of more rigid operational activities of internal affairs, border agency, intelligence and security agency and the State Investigation and Protection Agency, especially concerning the ID, passport, citizenship, stay permit checks, etc.
The forth element of action represents a group of measures related to the issues in the field of international relations. Above else, it is related to visa regime and their accordance with the Schengen rules and standards, the inspection of real and declarative activities of various associations and non-governmental agencies, etc. In addition, efforts have been intensified to achieve Bosnia and Herzegovina’s association to remaining international conventions and protocols in the field of fight against organized crime and terrorism.
Fifth, at the level of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adequate organizational and technical foundations were created for coordinated and efficient implementation of all these activities trough formation of a special ministry – the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
With these measures we are undertaking in the field of fight against organized crime and terrorism in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we clearly want to show our determination to become a part of a broader regional and world network of fight against organized crime and terrorism, for a common wellbeing.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the multiethnic and multi-religion country and after September 11, 2001, have shown their political maturity and responsibility for not allowing those not-so-long-ago war events to become the means of new manipulations, but sided with the anti-terrorist coalition. However, apart from decisiveness and determination of the bodies and institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the field of fight against terrorism, unfortunately, relicts of the past still linger, so much more must be done to make B-H a more secure and safer country. In order to achieve it, more must be done for mutual cooperation with the regional countries, by means of cooperation between intelligence and security agencies, police, and development of joint educational, scientific and research programmes relevant to fight against organized crime and international terrorism.
In that sense, I would like to confirm Bosnia and Herzegovina’s wish that the Secretariat of the Process for Cooperation in South East Europe should be located in Sarajevo, which, among else, will take over the activities of the Stability Pact.
Mobilisation of the entire world in fight against organized crime and terrorism will make a significant influence on whether the times of peace, security, democratic values and prosperity for all lie ahead of us, or would it be ordeal and demise of human and civilisation values.
Therefore, fight against organized crime and especially terrorism, must not be conflict of religions or civilisations, on the contrary, it must be fight for peaceful joint life of peoples of different cultures and religious denominations.
By signing the joint Declaration of fight against organized crime and terrorism today, we are taking a historic step in creating a safer and securer region, as a precondition of a general prosperity and association with European Union and the Euro-Atlantic integration.
Thanks!"

D E C L A R A T I O N
On fight against organized crime and terrorism
Organized crime and terrorism represent a global security threat, and the countries of South East Europe are exposed to it to a great extent, in the process of consolidation of stability in the region. In regard to organized crime, as one of the main sources of financing, as well as a means to destabilize countries, terrorism represents the most dangerous threat to peace, stability and democratic development of our region.
Bearing in mind that joint action in fighting organized crime and terrorism represents a necessary condition of security of each country and the region as a whole, we pledge to work jointly on:
Enlarging the normative capacities of the regional countries to fight organized crime and peril of terrorism successfully trough ratification of an agreement on police cooperation;
coordinating the legislative framework and the legislation of European Union so that all countries of the region could successfully prevent and tackle organized crime and terrorism internally, and in the framework of international cooperation of relevant institutions, including judiciary, police, security and intelligence agencies, as well as financial authorities;
establishing and developing all necessary ties and forms of cooperation with proper bodies of European Union, which are holders of fight against organized crime and terrorism, as well as with NATO;
developing capacities of intelligence and security agencies, police and judicial bodies to detect, monitor, document and process the actors of organized crime and terrorist activities. In that context, we especially insist on developing capacities of the mentioned bodies jointly to work and exchange all information necessary for fight against organized crime and terrorism in good will.
developing capacities of border, customs and immigration services in preventing the movement of organized criminal groups and terrorists and creating areas in the region in which they have the freedom of movement;
increasing the capacities of the mentioned services to act in emergency situations, in joint actions in eliminating the consequences of terrorist acts, especially acts committed with the weapon for mass destruction;
preventing the access to weapon and other materials suitable for conducting the terrorist acts, notably materials for mass destruction weapon production, as well as information exchange on emergence of new weapon and devices that could be used in terrorist activities;
cooperation based on the best practise in the region, aiming to create and strengthen national capacities for export control, as well as aiming to exchange experiences and cooperation in this important area;
optimal utilization of all existing mechanisms for development of regional cooperation in the field of fight against organized crime and terrorism;
developing the instruments for prevention of financing the organized criminal groups and terrorism, and
exchanging expertise and development of joint educational and scientific and research programmes of great significance for fight against organized crime and terrorism.
In view of achieving the mentioned goals, we pledge to establish an enduring dialogue at the level of Heads of States (or Governments).
We confirm that meetings at the ministerial level of relevant competence (internal affairs and/or justice) will be held regularly, once a year.
The cooperation at the level of experts will be organized permanently, as trough existing forms of regional cooperation, as well as bilaterally, and trough new forms of cooperation that will be determined on the basis of common interest."

Speech on occasion of the terrain inauguration – laying a cornerstone for the
Modern Art Museum in Sarajevo
Sarajevo, September 14, 2006
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank you for the invitation to lay a cornerstone today, here at the location where the Modern Art Museum – ARS AEVI will soon be built.
As we all know, I have been supporting actively this great project. The issue of ARS AEVI Museum was one of the topics during my talks with the President of the Republic of Italy and the UNESCO Secretary-General in March and June, this year.
I have also emphasized the significance of the ARS AEVI project for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire South-East Europe at the recent Summit of the South-East Europe countries and UNESCO in Opatija.
Why do I support the ARS AEVI project?
Firstly, because it confirms how much culture and arts can contribute to a country’s affirmation.
I remind you that the ARS AEVI project was initiated by a group of B-H cultural workers, led by the current General Director, Mr. Enver HADZIOMERSPAHIC in then surrounded Sarajevo. Even during the war, the ARS AEVI project became one of the most important ones in the area of modern area in Europe.
Secondly, because the Sarajevo collection ARS AEVI, according to an opinion of the most important world authorities of this field, is one of the most important European modern art collections today. Every country in the world would be proud to have such a cultural value.
Thirdly, the Sarajevo Modern Art Museum was drafted by one of the most important world architects, Renzo PIANO. In that way, Bosnia and Herzegovina will become one of the most significant modern art centres in Europe.
And fourthly, the ARS AEVI project will give an additional image to Sarajevo and our country as a tourist and cultural destination. The Modern Art Museum in Sarajevo will attract a great number of visitors worldwide. That means new job openings, directly or indirectly related to the museum.
Ladies and Gentlemen
I would also like to use this opportunity, in the name of Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, once again to thank UNESCO and the Government of the Republic of Italy, the Italian city Toscana and cities Rome, Venice, Florence and Milan for the previous and, I hope, future support. I thank the artists from all over the world, whose works are part of our collection.
Of course, special gratitude goes to the author of the project – Mr. Renzo PIANO. We are proud to have an architectural accomplishment by one of the most eminent world architects in Sarajevo.
I assure you that I will do my best to support this project in the future as well.
Thank you.”"

Speech at the event
DEFENSE OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA – UGMAN 2006.
Igman – Veliko polje, August 4, 2006.
“Dear families of shehits
and killes members of the RBiH Armed Forces
Dear defenders of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
First of all, I would like to say salaam and greet you all. I would especially like to say salaam to the members of the Igman battles – defenders of Igman and Sarajevo!
I would like to thank everyone present here today, who confirmed, together with us, that memories of defenders of our homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina are still fresh.
I will not talk about the Igman battles today, because celebrated commanders and soldiers are those who should be talking about it. I would like to say here that defending this territory had an enormous strategic significance. This territory connected Sarajevo with the free territory in the Middle Bosnia, Herzegovina etc.
This is a chance to commit ourselves once again:
to continue with the fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the State of equal peoples and citizens, for which our best sons gave their health and their lives!
to preserve and nurture the legacy of the defensive and liberation war and defend it from the malicious and cheap politics attacks!
particularly, we will not allow equalization of those who defended Bosnia and Herzegovina against the aggression and our people from destruction and those who committed the severest mass and systematic war crimes and had participated in the aggression and division of our country!
we will defend the values for which our best sons gave their lives, and we will take care of their families and disabled veterans!
we will persevere in the legal actions against Serbia and Montenegro for aggression and genocide! That is our commitment and we owe it to the victims and to justice and truth, but also to prevent evil from happening to anyone ever again!
I would also like to re-emphasize:
- that then, for the first time in the recent history of our country, we had the Bosnian army that fought only for Bosnia and Herzegovina and only in Bosnia and Herzegovina!
- thanks to the Army, numerous B-H patriots and a wise politics of our State leadership, led by president Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia and Herzegovina was defended, as well as the highest human and civilisation values of a multiethnic society, a thousand-year long tradition of coexistence, international and inter-religious tolerance! The idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina was defended, according to which the European Union has been created.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Of course, we must not forget what has happened! We must not forget that we were killed and harassed only for being different from our neighbours! And, why withheld it, for being Bosniacs and Muslims! However, we must not think that all of them are alike, because it is not true. If everyone would be the same, there would not be any Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the same time, we will never stop seeking justice! For the sake of justice and permanent peace, those responsible for crimes must be brought to trial! Moreover, we must face the future and continue the fight for Bosnia and Herzegovina in peace and trough democratic means! That is the only way and the best one!
Our goal is Bosnia and Herzegovina – a State of equal peoples and citizens on the entire territory and every part of it! Bosnia and Herzegovina can and should be a homeland to all its peoples and citizens!
We can reach this goal just as we had defended Bosnia and Herzegovina, which means that all B-H forces should be united in this path! We must be serious and responsible. Conflicts and divisions are in no one’s interest. We must preserve the peace that was difficultly established. We must not make mistakes or to be taken in by provocations! Especially us, who do not have any alternative and to whom Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only home!
Some people are trying to question something in Bosnia and Herzegovina that has been established long ago (referendum, sovereignty and integrity) and to make connection between that and the regional problems (Kosovo). They will not succeed in it! We will not allow them, like we did not allow it in 1992, when they were much stronger and when the YNA troops had occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Brothers and sisters!
Regardless of destabilisation attempts, there are no serious political forces, within our outside of B-H, which can endanger its territorial integrity and sovereignty! Country’s integration processes are building up; numerous State institutions were created. We have the State Border Service, the State Intelligence Agency, the Indirect Tax Administration, the State Customs Service, the state Armed forces and the Ministry of Defence, and if God wills it, a unique police system!
I know that this is still not the Bosnia and Herzegovina, for which her best sons have given their lives, but we are heading in the right direction.
All that, requires a lot of work, patience, expertise and wisdom. The only realistic policy is a policy of agreement, not confrontation! It is not possible to solve all the problems at once. The policy of solving problems gradually, i.e. step by step, will ensure solving the rest of the problems as well!
We are convinced that we have the strength, knowledge and wisdom to achieve this goal! We owe it to Igman, and every other B-H hero – defender of Bosnia and Herzegovina!
We are heading to become a member of the Partnership for Peace and NATO. We are fulfilling the conditions for membership in the European Union. Membership in these organizations means permanent security and prosperity. I am convinced that there is a place for Bosniacs in the union of equal European peoples, and for our religion, tradition and culture.
Finally, I would like to say salaam and greet you all. Next year, if God wills it, we will have gathered here in a greater number to pay respect to our defenders. I am convinced that our homeland – Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be stronger and closer to achieving its set goals!”"

Posjeta Libiji bila je deveta bilateralana posjeta u svojstvu predsjedavajućeg Predsjedništva Bosne i Hercegovine
""In the period of July 23 – 26, upon invitation of the Libyan President Muammer El-QHADAFI, I was in an official visit to the Libyan Jamahiriya. The visit to Libya was the ninth bilateral visit as a B-H Presidency Chairman (Belgium, Luxemburg, Italy, Holland, USA, Bulgaria, Qatar, Austria and Libya).
During this visit, I had meetings with:
- the President of Libya, Muammer El-QHADAFI
- the Prime Minister Dr El-Bagadi El-MAHMOUDI (on three occasions)
- the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Muhammed Abdurahman SHALGAM
- the Minister of Health, dr Muhammed RASHID
- the Minister for International Cooperation, Muhammed SAJAL
- the President of the Organization and the University of Islamic DAWA, Dr Ahmed Muhammed Esh-SHERIF
- the Director of the Institute for Dialogue and studying the Green Book, dr Milud El-MEHETBEL
- the General Director of ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY OF LIBYA, Omran BUKRA
Bearing in mind the great importance of Libya to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy, during this visit, there were our prominent businessmen in the Delegation: Tomislav GRIZELJ, the General Director of the GRIZELJ company and the President of the B-H Employers’ Association, Mujo SELIMOVIC, the General Director of MIMMS, Edin ARSLANAGIC, the General Director of BOSNALIJEK, Mehmed DRINO, the General Director of HIDROGRADNJA, Abdulharis SETA, the Deputy General Director of ENERGOINVEST, Nijaz VELADZIC, the General Director of SANITEKS and Emir GRANOV, the General Director of the GRANOFF company.
On this occasion, in the name of our country, Mr. Grizelj signed the Protocol on establishing the Business Council for Economic Cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Libya, and there was also a special meeting between our economic delegation and the Council of Libyan Businessmen. Our businessmen presented the economic possibilities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to their Libyan colleagues and proposed concrete forms of cooperation.
During the visit to Libya, I have visited the Monument to the unknown hero and the grave of President QHADAFI’s father, Muhammed Munyar Al-QHADAFI, one of the most famous fighters for independence of Libya, and I visited the shehit cemetery.
I also had pleasure to visit the newly opened juice factory JAFARA-MIMMS, which was recently opened by our MIMMS Company from Sarajevo as a first foreign investment in Libya. The factory already employs over 100 workers, out of which 43 are from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The JAFARA-MIMMS factory is an example of the B-H economy’s ability equally to compete in the world market.
A meeting with President Qhadafi
I met President Qhadafi immediately after arriving. We talked about the past, the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, causes of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its consequences, the reconstruction, the reintegration, the situation in the region, etc. The special accent was given to the economic cooperation, and I asked the Libyan leader to give the B-H companies a concrete work, to ease their work, but also to have Libyan companies participating in investment and privatization in Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Qhadafi emphasized that relations between Libya and Bosnia and Herzegovina have a special character, i.e. B-H companies have a privileged position while entering their market. Right after our conversation, he instructed the Prime Minister that this visit should result in concrete ventures. We also agreed that Bosnia and Herzegovina should have a central role in Libya’s relations with our region.
The main events of this visit:
1. I have initiated the establishment of special economic relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Libya, enabling our companies to have privileged position while entering the Libyan market, as well as numerous other benefits deriving from it. Libyan President Qhadafi accepted the proposal and authorised the Prime Minister to implement it.
2. The Libyan party accepted a request that B-H companies should get new jobs in the Libyan market, of course, in accordance with their possibilities.
3. I have requested exemptions with getting visa and working permits for our workers, as well as certain exemptions with applying Libyan legislation concerning hiring the foreign working force. That means that B-H companies could engage a greater number of our workers and would be exempted from a strict compliance with the rule to employ one of their citizens for every foreign worker in Libya.
4. We agreed to establish a direct airline Sarajevo-Tripoli, which would be maintained by AIR BOSNA and the Libyan National Airline Company together.
5. We have reached agreement on re-engaging our doctors and medical staff to work in Libya. The Libyan Minister of Health will visit Bosnia and Herzegovina in a few weeks to sign the bilateral agreement on this matter.
6. We have discussed the modalities of returning B-H debt for a credit amounting to 12.5 million US dollars, which our country took in 1991. The loan could be returned by giving a certain number of shares of one of the B-H companies to the Libyan Government. Considering the shown interest of the Libyan side, that company could be BOSNALIJEK.
7. I have received support from the Libyan Government and the Secretary-General of the non-governmental World Organization Islamic Dawa, which is UNESCO member, for completing support projects for the sustainable return of refugees. This Organization is also ready to help in restructuring the mosque FERHADIJA in Banja Luka, trough a special fund opened by UNESCO for this purpose. The Organization Islamic Dawa will open its branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
8. We have discussed establishment of scientific and technical cooperation of corresponding B-H institutions and the Institute for studying the Green Book.
9. We have agreed on starting the negotiations on a prompt signing of bilateral agreements between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Libya on
- stimulation and protection of investment
- avoiding double taxation
- cooperation in the area of tourism
- cooperation in the system of payment.
10. At the end of the visit, Libyan Prime Minister Dr El-Bagadi El-MAHMOUDI informed me about the following:
- that they have accepted my request to grant job of building 400 KW of portable long-distance power line to ENERGOINVEST of 160 million EUR worth. Moreover, I believe that the Libyan side would equally react to my insistence on contracting the ENERGOINVEST to build the cathode protective pipe in the Great River Project.
- that Bosnalijek, Saniteks and Maja-a pharmaceutical company should establish business cooperation that would enable Bosnalijek not only to sell medications and medical material in the Libyan market, but also to have a joint production and disposal of goods, not only in the Libyan market, but African as well. All these companies have already signed the Protocol on Special Cooperation.
- My initiative for Libyan participation in privatisation was accepted and they asked B-H to deliver them a proposal of privatisation and investment projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They showed interest in infrastructure and tourism.
- From earlier, we had information involving the decision of the Libyan Government to close a certain number of embassies in the world, including the embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I talked with the Libyan leader especially about it. After that, the decision was changed and the Libyan Embassy in B-H will continue to work.
At the end of my visit to Libya, Prime Minister Dr El-Bagadi El-MAHMOUDI emphasized that the leader, Muammer El-Qhadafi has requested, perhaps for the first time, that his Government and all institutions should sign contracts with the B-H companies (for example ENEGROINVEST-Long-distance power lines), and to give them priority in the future.
During the meeting with President Qhadafi, the very first day, I was given a personal attention. All following collocutors started talking by saying that they were working on leader Qhadafi’s instructions and that they have to close concrete deals.
I would also like to stress out that our Delegation in Libya was welcomed with the highest State honours and a special media attention (for instance, 17 minutes of the Central News of the Libyan State Television, on July 24, was dedicated to our visit)."

The ceremony of laying the cornerstone for building
the border crossing Bosanski Samac
Bosanski Samac, July 10, 2006
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish to greet you all and to express my pleasure for attending the ceremony of laying the cornerstone for building the border crossing in Bosanski Samac.
Perhaps it is unusual for a Chairman of the Presidency to attend such a ceremony. However, it is perfectly normal and expected of me to be here in Bosanski Samac today as a Chairman of the B-H Presidency, because this is also my town, where I was born and where I live.
Bosanski Samac, a town at the mouth of river Bosna into Sava, has always been Bosnia and Herzegovina’s doors, hence is the right place to build a border crossing. Nevertheless, it should also be what it always has been – a place of joining, not separation!
Therefore, I wish to thank the European Commission for ensuring funds for building eight border crossings, out of those three have already been built. I remind you that the European Commission funds were used to rebuild the bridge on river Sava as well. In addition, I thank ambassador Michael Humphreys.
Ladies and Gentlemen
This border crossing, as well as the others, will ensure a faster and a more efficient work of border guards and customs officials. That will ensure a shorter stopping and a quicker crossing, which is important as for the citizens, as for economy as well.
That is also important for Bosanska Posavina. Completing this project, as well as the others, primarily in the area of waterpower engineering and agriculture, will be development stimulus for the Posavina region. Construction of the Corridor 5c and railroad and harbour transport also fall into that category. Here we have an oil industry as well. In that way, Bosanska Posavina will take its rightful place in development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I expect to have support from the International Community in these projects, primarily the European Commission.
In the end, I wish a fast and successful work completion and I hope that we will soon have an opportunity to witness the ceremony of opening this crossing, and the successful completion of other projects in this region as well.
Thank you!”"
21271,H Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic’s speech on occasion of opening the Visoko,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=21271&langTag=en-US,2006-07-10,"I congratulate and thank everybody who contributed to the construction of this highway section, notably the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and B-H Telekom.
Opening the Visoko-Podlugovi section of the Sarajevo-Zenica Highway
July 10, 2006
“Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish to say salaam and greet you, as well as to express my pleasure for witnessing the ceremony of work completion and opening the Visoko-Podlugovi highway section.
I congratulate and thank everybody who contributed to the construction of this highway section, notably the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and B-H Telekom.
The construction of this highway section, the quality work and meeting the highest standards confirm that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a construction practise and experts capable of building modern highways. Therefore, I congratulate them as well.
As every citizen, I expect that the work on the next section Kakanj-Visoko will continue as soon as possible. We have to go faster and build much more highway kilometres per year. That is why we need a better organization and the European legislation. We must adopt laws ensuring the just compensation and efficient procedure urgently, which will accelerate the construction work.
Of course, we also need large financial means. As a possible solution to ensuring the necessary means, I see using the profit made by selling the public companies, including the one made by privatising the BH Telekom.
It is not good to reach the standards of the 21st century in the sphere of telecommunication while still being in 19th or first half of 20th century in motorway and railroad communication. With the privatisation funds, we will ensure money not only for the Corridor 5c but also for fast motorways Sarajevo-Tuzla, Stolac-Neum, Sarajevo-Gorazde, Busovaca-Travnik etc. We must also modernize the railroad transportation.
I believe that for our country, still burdened with repairing the consequences of sufferings and destruction, this is the best way. The Budget cannot do it, and a major debt would endanger other development projects. We can hardly get concessionaires, and we do not have time to wait for them any longer.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Corridor 5c is a project of uniting the country and its progress. Where the corridor passes, the lines of separation and division (entity, cantonal, municipal) disappear.
We must create foundations in order to build the Corridor 5c in several sections – north and south of the country. Toward that goal, I find important to start with the work in the north part – the entrance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That means building a bridge on the river Sava near Svilaj, at the border with the Republic of Croatia, and a Highway section toward Doboj.
With better roads, we are ensuring linkage between our regions, a regional development, and an even demographic disposition. In addition, we are connecting Bosnia and Herzegovina with other countries; we are establishing better business cooperation and creating grounds for development and enhancement of tourism.
Therefore, I wish that opening this highway section would be a NEW BEGINNING, not just faster construction of the Corridor 5c, but also of the entire development and prosperity of our country.
Once again, I congratulate everyone who participated in this project, especially the contractors.
Thank you!”"
21128,H Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic’s speech at the inaugural assembly of the Adriatic Euro,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=21128&langTag=en-US,2006-06-30,"The District of Istria, with its position, history, diversity, tolerance and openness is the best place for founding, i.e. holding the Inaugural Assembly of the Euro-Adriatic Region
Pula, June 30, 2006
“Dear President Mesic,
Head of District Jakovcic,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the work of the Adriatic Euro-Region and an opportunity to address you.
The District of Istria, with its position, history, diversity, tolerance and openness is the best place for founding, i.e. holding the Inaugural Assembly of the Euro-Adriatic Region.
The Adriatic has always had an important role in our countries’ relations – mostly as a factor of connecting various peoples and cultures of its coasts. Unfortunately, sometimes it served as a pretext for conflicts. For a very long time, the Adriatic Sea also served as a major traffic route for trade between the rest of Europe and the world and our region, but also as a path, which was used by the foreign conquerors and their influence. We want it only as a connection and cooperation place and that is why we are here today.
Our countries connected by the Adriatic Sea have many things in common – history, similar traditions, cuisine, and the charming southern mentality we share. All that represents an additional reason for intensifying our cooperation.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a maritime country, not so much as the others, but is faced toward the Adriatic in many things. As a multiethnic country, where different peoples, members of the four great world monotheistic religions, have lived for centuries, Bosnia and Herzegovina is very interested in establishing a comprehensive cooperation with the other countries of the Adriatic region.
There is plenty of room for that kind of cooperation, at the local and regional level as well as at the State one, in tourism, environmental protection, culture, sports, economy, infrastructural projects, and cooperation in the International organizations.
The regional connection will certainly contribute to the protection of the Adriatic, strengthening the economic and cross-border cooperation, aiming at a quicker access to the European Union for the member countries. Apart from that, connecting the Adriatic to its inland is also important. Here I mean the economic and tourist connection. When we in Bosnia-Herzegovina talk about the Adriatic – Neum, we must also mention Medjugorje, Mostar and the Olympic mountains of Sarajevo and other attractive destinations. This is important as for tourism, as for the cultural cooperation. Here today, are also the representatives of a B-H region – the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, but they also represent the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Therefore, I once again congratulate you on this good initiative. In the name of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I give you my full support and send my best wishes for a successful work."

The announcement of reaching a decision to close the Office of the High Representative and the transformation into the Special Representative of the European Union is certainly one of the most important decisions after the Dayton Agreement
Speech at the session of the Peace Implementation Council’s Supervisory Board
Sarajevo, June 22, 2006
“Dear members of the Peace Implementation Council’s Supervisory Board,
Mr. High Representative,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you and welcome you to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sarajevo. I thank PIC and the Supervisory Board for the support in the previous implementation of the Dayton Agreement.
I thank for the possibility to address the Peace Implementation Council Supervisory Board today. The announcement of reaching a decision to close the Office of the High Representative and the transformation into the Special Representative of the European Union is certainly one of the most important decisions after the Dayton Agreement.
First and foremost, I would again like to emphasize the firm determination for our country’s European way, as a perspective without any alternative. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s membership in the European Union and NATO is the best way to establish a permanent peace, stability and prosperity as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as in the entire region of the Southeastern Europe.
A significant progress in all fields has been achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After ten years, many would agree that it was a logical follow-up and that it is time for the B-H institutions to take over the full responsibility.
It is completely normal that it is also a wish of every citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because it would be a confirmation of the previous progress and the achieved results, as well as the comprehensive stability in the country. It certainly means ending the OHR and Bonn powers. However, apart from the achieved progress, many in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including myself, are concerned about the announcement of an impending adoption of such a decision.
Why? Because the constitutional-legal and political requirements for the B-H institutions to take over the responsibility for the situation in the country have not been met yet.
Withdrawing the High Representative and ending the Bonn powers now could lead to work blockade of the institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as a hold-up in conducting the reforms and meeting the European requirements. The Annex IV of the B-H Constitution cannot function without the Annex X – the Civilian Implementation, i.e. OHR, unless reviews and amendments to the Constitution were carried out prior to it.
Furthermore, almost all institutions at the level of Bosnia-Herzegovina are composed on the principle of parity and consensus decision-making. The institute of veto is widely represented and can be used, almost limitlessly, under the form of so-called protection of ethnic or entity interest. All of these are constitutional mechanisms of institutional work blockade, and without any de-blockade mechanisms (the example of work blockade of the Parliament, Council of Ministers, appointing the SIPA Director, DGS, revenue distribution, police reform, etc.)
If, without the previous Constitutional review, the Office of the High Representative is shut done and the Bonn powers are ended, there will be a possibility of endangering the previously achieved progress. Transferred powers of the formed institution of Bosnia-Herzegovina and their functioning could seriously become endangered. We are witnessing the common announcements of returning the transferred powers from State to Entity and the blockade of B-H institutions’ work.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Whatever the case may be, I believe that the time is not right for making such decisions. I am primarily referring to the failure in adopting the amendments to the B-H Constitution and the radicalisation of situation due to it. This is an election year when it is normally difficult to carry out the reforms. Closing the OHR and ending the Bonn powers will encourage the antireform forces in blocking or delaying the execution of reforms, waiting for the OHR mandate to expire.
The second reason is the situation in the region, affecting the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in one way or another. We are witnessing the appeals for referendum for the RS’s secession, after announcing the Montenegro’s independence. Before us is a decision on the final status of Kosovo. What also needs to be mentioned is that the most wanted war criminals are still at large.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Because of all previously mentioned, I believe that such decisions should not be reached today, not even in the form of an announcement. Prior to it, we should:
1. wait for the election results and form the government
2. adopt amendments to the Constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina that will create legal grounds for the discontinuation of mandate and ending the Bonn powers of the High Representative
3. sign the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with EU
If the moderate forces win the elections, form the government, adopt the first phase of Constitutional reforms, and sign the Association and Stabilisation Agreement, it will be logical to reach such decisions. In the meantime, the Kosovo status will be solved, and most likely, the remaining war suspects will be arrested.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my duty and responsibility to point out to you the possible consequences of a premature adoption of such a decision. Do not allow the destabilisation of situation and repeating the situation from 1992 due to a bad judgement. You have a great responsibility.
Do not allow that a successful project of the International Community becomes endangered. We are close to success. We have a chance in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the greatest monotheistic religions meet and most intensely intertwine, to confirm the thesis of possibility of coexistence of diversity, and in that way, to refute the theory of civilisation conflict in the best possible way.
Please, before making a decision, reconsider what I have just told you.”"

Mr IVO MIRO JOVIC
ON OCCASION OF CELEBRATING THE 14TH ANNIVERSARY OF FESTIVITY
‘LIPANJSKE ZORE – MOSTAR’,
THE CROATIAN CENTRE ‘STJEPAN KOSACA’, JUNE 21, 2006
“Dear defenders of Mostar, members of HVO, ladies and gentlemen,
I greet you all at this central gathering, organized on occasion of the traditional 14th anniversary of festivity ‘Lipanjske zore-Mostar’ 1992-2006.
This is an opportunity when we can remind ourselves of the great and difficult moments for the defenders of the city of Mostar, the members of HVO and the entire valley of the river Neretva.
The importance of events in June 1992 bears a historic dimension for the Croatian people, HVO, the city of Mostar and the entire B-H.
We must always stress out these facts so that history could properly appreciate the given contribution of the Croats to the defence of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. Therefore, we are glad to say thanks to Zvonimir Puljic the Mayor of Split, for being here with us today…
In these events, the Croats of the valley of Neretva, organized in HVO units, stopped the enemy in his strategic direction of attack, in that way defended their home, their city of Mostar, and gave an immeasurable contribution to the defence of the entire B-H.
Proud of those days, of all the participants of those events, I wish to thank them on this occasion as well.
Considering the magnitude and the significance of the defence of the Neretva valley, we cannot but to express our dissatisfaction with the fact that some of us, to this day, are not ready to accept those facts and say thanks to defenders of the city of Mostar, thanks to members of HVO.
Instead, today we face the strongly-expressed desire for criminalization of our Patriotic War, its most important participants, who are incarcerating, persecuting, abusing and arresting.
Such actions aim to belittle the truly given contribution of the Croats and HVO in defending B-H, but also to frighten us, and weaken us in our fight for the equality of peoples in B-H.
All this is part of political processes, trough which the Croatian people is being deprived of their rights and not brought in the same position as the other two peoples in B-H.
However, we cannot and will not be discouraged or despair because of those challenges and intentions. This is our country, this is where our home is and so it shall remain.
We proudly emphasize our given contribution in the Patriotic War; we condemn everything unacceptable that was done, because we cannot fall into a trap of a collective guilt of the entire people, and allow others to attribute our credits to themselves.
We cannot and will not allow it.
Dear defenders, members of HVO,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The current political moment in B-H demands patience, persistence and wisdom from all of us in order to have the peoples in B-H participating in political processes, which should result in a new just constitutional-legal organization of B-H as a home for all three constituent and sovereign people that will enjoy all the deserved collective and civil rights trough legislative, judicial and executive power.
It will not be easy to achieve that goal, especially bearing in mind the fact that points to the political disunity of the Croatian essence, manifested trough the establishment of a great number of political parties with the Croatian mark on them, which considering the Croatian demographic situation in B-H, could be dangerous during the impending general elections in B-H.
Everyone must be aware of these facts, i.e. must stop disbanding the political origin of the Croats in B-H, especially if the reason is within an individual personal interest.
Because of your sacrifice, defenders, no one has a right to these actions in this country.
Our better political future is directly conditioned with our real political unity without declarative, verbal, empty statements and calls for the need of political unity.
An example of this real unity was shown by you defenders, during the most difficult war times; that example must also be followed by the current political Heads.
Without such approach, we will not be a political factor as a people, and our representatives in the power bodies will be elected by others.
Today, when we are celebrating this important anniversary of the Patriotic War, we want to send a message to everyone in B-H – the Croats are for the political cooperation based on principles of equality, without domination of one over the other, including the respect for every European democratic standard ensuring the basic rights of preserving the identity of every people.
With such an idea, you defenders have stood up, made a sacrifice and defended your and our town Mostar.
Once again, I wish to say a sincere human thanks to all the members of HVO, victims’ families and wounded defenders of the Patriotic War, believing that the sacrifice you made will not be in vain. That is why we are here today to be proud of your deeds.
THANK YOU”"

Speech by B-H Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic
at the press conference
Sarajevo, June 8, 2006
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
in the period of June 6-8, 2006, upon invitation of the Emir of the State of Qatar, His Majesty Hamad bin Al-Thani, I was in an official visit to Qatar.
During the visit, I had following meetings with:
- Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Halifa Al-Thani
- Prime Minister of Qatar Sheikh Abdallah bin Khalifa Al-Thani
- Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar Ahmad Abdallah Al-Mahmud
- President of the Qatar Foundation for Education and Qatar Emir’s wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Al-Misned
I also had a meeting with President of the Qatar Economic Chamber Council Sheikh Halifa bin Jassim Bin Muhamad Al-Thani and 80 prominent Qatar’s businessmen, whom I had informed with the economic potentials of our country.
On that occasion, the Protocol on establishing the Business Council for Economic Cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Qatar was signed. Mr. Tomislav Grizelj, the President of Businessmen’ Association and the Vice-president of the B-H Foreign Trade Chamber’s Administrative Committee signed the Protocol on behalf of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mrs. Jasna Krivosic-Prpic, the FIPA General Director’s deputy was also a member of the Delegation, and she had a distinguished speech and a presentation of possibilities for investing in our country.
I also visited the University of Qatar, as well as the Qatar’s City of Education, where I talked with the officials of those institutions.
During my stay in Doha, I also visited the head office of Al-Jazeera, where I gave a longer interview.
The main contents of the visit:
1. I have initiated Qatar’s participation in two great business projects in our country:
- Building the Corridor 5C
- Qatar’s entry in the oil and natural gas market in B-H, trough privatization, i.e. additional capitalisation of our companies/facilities in this domain.
The Emir of Qatar took these proposals with a great interest and he authorised the Government to examine them thoroughly.
2. The initiative for discussions about additional capitalisation of Air Bosna/BH Airlines was accepted, in the way that the Qatar national airline company, or a private sector, would enter their capital in Air Bosna, using the airport in Sarajevo as their port to Europe, and open the line Sarajevo – Doha – Malaysia – Australia.
3. Qatar has shown interest for the spring water import from our country. Emir Hamad bin Halifa Al-Thani agreed with me that during the next visit to his country, we should drink the water from Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Since we are talking about the great project, it is necessary to create a consortium of the largest B-H water producers, so that they would come out as a joint brand in not only the market of Qatar, but the entire region as well.
4. They confirmed their willingness to continue with the completion of projects of sustainable returns to our country. In that sense, an initiative to finance a concrete project in Srebrenica – building a Factory for fruit and vegetable canning, has been accepted.
5. Emir also accepted a request for Qatar’s financial support to the B-H Court and building the state penitentiary.
6. An initiative has been accepted for awarding permanent scholarships for educating a certain number of children without parents in our country, with the continuation of scholarships for B-H students in abroad.
7. Aiming to enhance the relations, opening the embassy of Qatar in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been agreed, because we are currently being covered from Rome – Italy.
8. Qatar Emir gladly accepted an invitation to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina soon.
Qatar has a very friendly attitude toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, which we experienced ourselves during this visit. Not only were we accepted with the highest State honours, but His Majesty Emir of Qatar has personally provided a special airplane for a trip to Doha.”"

Doha, June 7, 2006
“Your Excellency Sheikh Halifa bin Jassim bin Muhammad Al-Thani, the President of the Qatar Economic Chamber,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to express my pleasure with having this opportunity to speak to you today, here in Doha, on occasion of my official visit to the friendly State of Qatar.
The State of Qatar and His Majesty Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Halifa Al-Thani have a special place in our hearts. We will never forget your support to our country in the most difficult moments of our past, nor the help to the post-war reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
It is my great pleasure to witness today the signing of the Agreement on establishment of a Joint Business Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Qatar, which we see as an important step in intensification of economic cooperation between our two countries.
There is a lot of space for establishing the economic cooperation between our countries.
It is our wish that Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the following period, becomes the most important destination for Qatar’s investment in the Southeastern Europe. Bosnia-Herzegovina can become a door to European Union for Qatar’s businessmen.
And now, couple of information about my country:
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic State where three largest world monotheistic religions – Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy – most intensively meet, intertwine and coexist. In Sarajevo, which is also called the European Jerusalem, and in other B-H cities as well, for hundreds of years, side by side, stand mosques, catholic and orthodox churches, somewhere even synagogues. After the war ended 10 years ago, an established peace has never been violated. We are restructuring the country and economy, but also the multiethnic structure of society.
A macroeconomic stability has been achieved with an inflation such as is in the European Union. We have the strongest currency in the region. Compared to the post-war period, GDP has been tripled. Foreign exchange reserves have been increased 15 times. We are regularly paying off our foreign debt. The industry production and foreign investment are in a constant growth. Banking system has been consolidated, and now is a complete private property. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is a large number of well-known banks and renowned world investors, such as Coca-Cola, Siemens, Volkswagen, Ispat Group, Kia, LNM, Daimler Chrysler, etc.
We have a very competent and educated human potential. B-H companies have a significant experience in working in the world markets and can be a good and useful business partner. Bosnia-Herzegovina has signed agreements on free trade with also every country in the region of the Southeastern Europe. Thus, when arriving to Bosnia-Herzegovina, you get the market of around 150 millions of consumers. We have a free, duty-free export to the countries of European Union. Apart from that, we have the most liberal law on investment that makes no difference between the domestic and foreign investors.
The possibilities for investment in our country are countless. I would like here to point to our comparative advantages in the sectors of industry, agriculture, energy, tourism (winter, summer, spa and religious), information technologies, oil industry and mining. As a good example of potential investment, I would like to cite a possibility of investing in the national airline company BH AIRLINES.
We are especially interested in investing in great infrastructural projects like Corridor 5c – building a freeway across Bosnia-Herzegovina in length of 320 km., this project is of extreme importance, not only as an infrastructural, but also as a development and integration project that reunites Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Due to all that, I invite you to come to Bosnia-Herzegovina and convince yourself of all the advantages our country can offer to you. Welcome to Bosnia-Herzegovina!"

The visit of the war ship TURGUTREIS of the Republic of Turkey
to the territorial waters of Bosnia-Herzegovina
Neum, June 3, 2006
“Mr. Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey Bulent Tulum,
Mr. Commander of the war ship Omer Cetin
Gentlemen Ministers, Ambassadors,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish to say salaam to you all, to greet you and express my pleasure for gathering here at the Turkish war ship TURGUTREIS today.
I especially wish to greet the ship’s crew and express welcome to the territorial waters of B-H’s part of the Adriatic Sea.
This visit represents a continuity of friendly relations between our two countries, but also a confirmation of a sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its territorial waters.
Today we have a visit of the Turkish war ship. A while ago, there were French, German and American war ships here. Due to those, and for other, primarily economic reasons, it is necessary that the authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina examine the justification of building the harbour in Neum, where these and similar ships could dock.
Such visits are important, as for friendly relations of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey, as well as for B-H’s cooperation with the NATO Alliance.
And in the current political moment, this visit is an important message.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The friendship between the Republic of Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina has a long-lasting value. Many things are in common to our countries, starting with the fact that we are part of the region of the Southeastern Europe, a joint history, culture and other contents, but also a joint future membership in EU and NATO.
The Republic of Turkey is an important member of NATO. Its support to Bosnia-Herzegovina on that way is very significant.
In the period of 1995-2005 in Turkey, 426 officers and soldiers from Bosnia-Herzegovina completed their military training. Besides that, 906 completed combat arm specialising courses, out of which 7 for airplane pilots and 10 for helicopter pilots. 1919 members of armed forces complete a collective training in Turkey. Currently, 7 members of B-H armed forces attends the Turkish military-medical academy, 5 members attend the lad forces school, etc.
It is important to emphasize that this training is being conducted according to the highest NATO standards.
A special gratitude we owe to Turkey for support and assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the most difficult moments of our country. The Turkish units are constantly present in Bosnia-Herzegovina in a function of establishing and preserving the peace and stability as a part of UNPROFOR, SFOR, EUFOR forces.
Versatile relations between our countries are crowned with the recent visits at the highest level of Taip Erduan the Prime Minister of Turkey and President Ahmet Sezer. The today’s visit is also a confirmation of our friendly relations.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is determined to meet all requirements laid on front of here in order to become a member of the Partnership for Peace and the NATO Alliance as soon as possible.
We are conducting the defence system reform. That means having one army, depoliticised, multi-ethnic and professional. We are already capable of having our military forces in peace missions worldwide. We are no longer a receiver but also a provider of international military assistance.
Small countries can best ensure their security trough the NATO Alliance membership. Especially important is cooperation and support of NATO member countries, among which Turkey has an important place.
Therefore, I once again wish to welcome the crew of the war ship to the territorial waters of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Long live Bosnia-Herzegovina! Long live the republic of Turkey!
Long live the friendship of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey!”"

Communication of heritage – A new vision for South East Europe
Opatija, June 1-2, 2006
""Mr. President of the Republic of Croatia,
Gentlemen presidents,
Mr. General Secretary of UNESCO,
Mr. Secretary-General of the Council of Europe,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I share the congratulations and gratitude to our host and a friend, Stjepan MESIC the President of Croatia, for his warm hospitality and en excellent organization of this gathering.
I find that today’s meeting is a continuation of a dialogue process at the highest level of the countries of the Southeastern Europe in the domain of culture and cultural heritage, which initiated under the patronage of UNESCO in Ohrid in 2003.
A specific geographic position at the crossroads between the East and the West, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, as well as a very rich and tumultuous history of our region, have made the Southeastern Europe a mosaic of religions, cultures, traditions and language.
The joint history and the ethnic structure of our countries refer to a comprehensive cooperation. In our region, peoples, religions and cultures meet, intertwine and more or less coexist in harmony. One people often live on the both or more sides of the border, on one side as a majority, and in other countries as a minority population. The same is with our monuments and symbols of culture, which are everywhere in the region. These relations, including the protection and reconstruction, must be built in accordance with the European standards. Representatives of a majority people, above all, are responsible for the protection and reconstruction of cultural-historic heritage of minorities. They have to preserve the cultural heritage of minority peoples. In that way, they are providing an example how other should treat their cultural heritage.
By rescuing the cultural heritage as a witness of our span, we are preserving self-awareness and investing in future. Everyone should be proud of the entire cultural heritage, regardless of the period, culture or people it derives from. That is our affluence and our advantage, by no means a drawback. On these foundations, we should build bridges of cooperation for a better joint future of the Southeastern Europe as a region of tolerance, reconciliation and an intercultural dialogue.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a region in small, because there, different peoples, religions and cultures meet, intertwine and coexist for centuries, mostly in harmony. In Sarajevo, which is also called the European Jerusalem, Mostar, as well as the majority of other B-H towns, side by side, for centuries, stand mosques, catholic and orthodox churches, synagogues and other cultural-historic monuments and symbols.
In the wars that signified the 20th century in these areas, especially in the period of 1991-1995, there was a systematic destruction of cultural-historic monuments and other sites. Therefore, the protection and reconstruction of a cultural heritage is important for history as well as for future. It contributes to the preservation and strengthening the State identity and ensuring the fundamental human rights. Every protected and/or reconstructed object brings us a step closer to a return of trust and tolerance, which are parts of our several centuries’ long tradition.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish to express my pleasure with the fact that a decision was made at the last session of the Committee for Cultural Heritage in Durban in South Africa on enlisting the Old Bridge and the historic centre of Mostar in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Its symbolic meaning is even more important because in the Declaration from our previous Summit held in Varna last year, the Old Bridge in Mostar was pronounced the symbol of coexistence and reconciliation in the region.
That was an important incentive to our country to intensify activities in restoration and protection of our cultural and natural wealth.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has recently been nominated for another cultural-historic monument to be enlisted in the World Heritage List – the Mehmed-Pasha Sokolovic Bridge in Visegrad. Besides that, we are also preparing the nominations for the complex of the Old City of Jajce and the Vjetrenica Caves.
We are also interested in nomination for enlisting the National Park of Sutjeska in the World Heritage List, as a joint cross-border project with the National Park of Durmitor in the neighbouring Montenegro. In that way, we will permanently preserve the natural wealth of our two countries – especially the canyons of rivers Drina and Tara in the best possible way.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I use this occasion to thank UNESCO and the General Director Matsuura personally for the shown concrete readiness to accept the initiative of the B-H Presidency that UNESCO should include three symbolic religious objects in our country – the Ferhadija Mosque in Banja Luka, the Serb Cathedral in Mostar and the Catholic Convent Plehan in Derventa in the reconstruction.
I would like to thank UNESCO for the previous support in completing the project ARS AEVI – the establishment of one of the most important European museums in Sarajevo. In that way, Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the entire region, will become one of the leading destinations of modern art.
Ladies and Gentlement,
A month ago, intensive archaeological excavations started in the area of Visoko, 30 km from Sarajevo. According to the findings of the eminent group of archaeologists, there are remnants of several pyramids.
Previously performed testing, including the one performed by the Egyptian experts for pyramids, confirm the shown results.
If this thesis becomes definitely confirmed, that will be one of the biggest and most spectacular archaeological discoveries in the world that will significantly changed the history of Europe and turn our region into one of the most important destinations for scientific explorations and tourism.
Bosnia-Herzegovina will extremely appreciate if UNESCO decides to send several experts to Visoko. Additionally, I invite all the archaeologists of the countries in the region to take part in the excavations in the field.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
After the period of confinement caused by the division of our continent and the recent conflicts marked with wars, sufferings and destruction of cultural monuments, our region is entering a new period – a period of openness, good-neighbouring relations, cultural and all other forms of cooperation.
That new period should be marked with the reconstruction and affirmation of the rich cultural heritage of the Southeastern Europe.
Therefore, I strongly support the intensification of cultural cooperation between our countries and the establishment of network of cultural corridors and cultural pathways.
We support the initiative for intensification of activities in promoting the cultural-historic wealth of our region, and therefore, we believe that the new information technologies can be a very useful tool for that promotion.
By establishing the cultural corridors, the affirmation and the joint promotion of our cultural heritage, we can again make the Southeast European region a destination that will attract visitors from the entire world due its heritage and diversity, and in that way, we will open new development perspectives for our countries.
Thus, we will send a clear political message of willingness constructively to include our countries in all international processes and of determination to make the Southeast European region an example of establishing good relations and cooperation based on a constant dialogue and wealth of cultural diversity.
Thank you.”"

at the celebration of liberation of the Suada Dilberovic and Olga Sucic Bridge
Sarajevo, May 27, 2006
“Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear citizens of Sarajevo
Mr. Minister Mekachera, Admiral Lanxad, General Gobilliard,
Esteemed Ambassador of the Republic of France to B-H Mr. HENRY ZIPPER DE FABIANI,
Members of the Diplomatic Corps,
Exactly eleven years ago, May 27, 1995, two French soldiers AMARU and HUMBLOT, gave their lives right here, on the Suada and Olga Bridge in a mission of peace in then surrounded Sarajevo.
This is an opportunity to remind ourselves of that event:
Early in the morning, on May 27, the French lookout military positions, right beside the Vrbanja Bridge in Zagrebacka street, was suddenly occupied by the Serbian paramilitary formations dressed in the UN uniforms. The French Military Command considered this situation unacceptable and ordered a counterattack. That meant the liberation of the post, during which two French soldiers w ere killed and 17 were wounded.
Their action signalled the turning point in International Peace Forces’ approach to the war in Bosnai-Herzegovina. Until then, mostly the observers of the B-H citizens’ sufferings, they became active participants in preventing and stopping the war and establishing a permanent peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzgovina.
In this fashion, France ended an absurd logic of behaviour of the International Peace Forces that equalized the aggressor and the victim. Under its influence, disposing of the forces for quick intervention and lifting the siege over Sarajevo, the NATO engagement, the cessation of hostilities, and in the end, signing the peace agreement, all soon came about.
Therefore, in a certain way, this action has become a pioneer in new politics of the International Community in which France had had a significant role.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its citizens cannot forget what France had done for our country.
Eighty-four French soldiers gave their lives for the establishment of peace in our country. They will forever remain in our memories.
Today, ten years after the establishment of peace, we can say that their sacrifice was not in vain.
The established peace has never been violated; Bosnia-Herzegovina is on a good way to join the Euro-Atlantic integration. We are conducting powerful reforms. We are integrating the society. We are reconstructing the multi-ethnic structure of our country. We are building a unity of diversity based on the multi-century long tradition of our peoples’ co-existence.
Only ten years ago, the world sent soldiers to peace-establishing missions in B-H. Today, our military and police forces are participating in the international peace missions worldwide. B-H is no longer just a receiver but also a provider of an international military assistance.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I want to express my extreme pleasure with the fact that the Ambassador of the French President, Mr. Hamlaoui Mekachera the Minister for Veterans’ and Admiral Jacques Lanxade the Commander of the French Army Headquarters during that action, as well as General Gobilliard the UNPROFOR Commander in the sector of Sarajevo of that time are here with us today. Their presence here is a proof of friendship between our countries.
Once again, I wish to emphasize the important role that French President Jacques Chirac had had in putting and end to the war and the establishment of peace.
The friendship between Bosnia-Herzegovina and France has a long, long tradition. Two hundred years ago, France appointed its first consul to our country.
France was also the first country to accredit an ambassador to an internationally recognised and independent Bosnia-Herzegovina - in June 1993. The citizens of Sarajevo will never forget the fact that the first French ambassador, Mr. Henry JACOLIN had shared with them their most difficult war days in our surrounded Capital.
Because of all that, we are convinced that France will continue strongly to support Bosnia-Herzegovina and now, when our country is in a decisive phase of a European path.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This site has a special symbolic meaning for the City of Sarajevo. Here, in 1992, fell a first victim of war. On the same place, French soldiers AMARU and HUMBLOT were killed, which signified the beginning of war in our country.
This and other events remind us of our past, which we must accept, our present, which we have to use in the best possible way and to build a better future for all our peoples and citizens.
We want these and similar sufferings never to happen again in our country, as well as anywhere else in the world!
Long live Bosnia-Herzegovina! Long live the Republic of France!
Long live the friendship between Bosnia-Herzegovina and France!"

Speech by Sulejman Tihic, the B-H Presidency Chairman
at the 13th Summit of Heads of Central European countries
Varna – Bulgaria, May 19, 2006
THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF EUROPE
""Your Excellencies, Presidents and Prime Ministers,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would also like to congratulate our host for the excellent organization of this Summit and the shown hospitality.
I would also like to express my pleasure with the cooperation intensification and the meetings at the highest level of representatives of the Central European countries.
I would especially like to emphasize the significance of the further strengthening and enhancing the economic relations among our countries, and to welcome the initiative of our host to attach an economic dimension to this Summit, trough the participation of a number of eminent businessmen.
Some of the countries will become members next year, some have started negotiating the full-fledged membership, some have gained or are awaiting the candidate status, and some have started negotiating to sign the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement. We are all going in the same direction, faster or slower. We are becoming a part of the democratic community of equal peoples – European countries, united in the European Union and NATO.
In that sense, I would like to express my pleasure with the recently achieved agreement on enlargement of the Central European free trade zone with the countries of the Southeastern Europe, which is also an important step forward for the integration of the entire region in the European Union.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This is also an opportunity to inform you about the achieved progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina:
Regardless of our difficult past, we are facing toward the future. The peace established ten years ago has never been violated. Around a million, i.e. 50% of the exiled and refugees have returned so far. In that way, we are restoring the multi-ethnic structure of our country and building the unity of diversity, such as was the one that had existed in Bosnia-Herzegovina for centuries. We are building a State where Bosniacs, Serbs, Croats and all other peoples and citizens will be equal. We are making compromises in that way, because Bosnia-Herzegovina can only survive if it is made to fit all our citizens and peoples. We are seeking to find what we have in common, what unites us and bonds us, not what separates us.
Claims that there was a religious war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on multi-century old intolerance and impossibility of co-existence of different religions and cultures are unfounded! We are talking about a conflict between the two ways of life and organizations of society. One, based on domination, totalitarianism, intolerance and negation of everything that is different, and the second, preaching equality of all people, tolerance, multi-ethnic and multi-confessional society, where differences mean wealth and advantage.
In that way, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a living proof of a complete senselessness of theories about the so-called unavoidability of conflict of civilisations.
We have started negotiations on signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union. We are expecting to have this Agreement signed by the end of this year or the beginning of the next. We are conducting comprehensive reforms of defence system in order to be adjusted to the NATO standards. Instead of three multi-ethnic armies, we are establishing one professional, depoliticised and multi-ethnic army. Bosnia-Herzegovina is not only a receiver, but also a giver of military help. Our military and police units are participating in the International peace missions in Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Eritrea, etc. We are expecting B-H to be accepted in the Partnership for Peace, and by 2008, to be invited to join the NATO. Of course, this means an unconditional cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, including arresting the remaining six war criminals from the Hague list.
I hope that, together with others, we will soon fulfil this commitment. That is primarily in our interest, because only on foundations of truth and justice, we can build a better future.
We have started the process of constitutional reforms and achieved an agreement on modalities of the first phase of our Constitution’s changes. That will mean a more efficient and a more functional authority that would alleviate and accelerate not only the process of an internal integration, but also the membership in EU and NATO. The agreement received support from the largest number of citizens and a majority of Parliament members. Unfortunately, due to two votes, the amendments did not get the 2/3 majority and are not adopted yet. Regardless, I hope that in the following period these amendments will be adopted.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to convey Bosnia-Herzegovina’s position on two issues our region is going to face with in the following period – the issue of referendum on independence of Montenegro and resolving the Kosovo status.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is satisfied with the fact that Serbia and Montenegro have found a compromise regarding the modalities of organizing the referendum in accordance with the EU demands, and we are convinced that the both sides would fully comply with the referendum results, regardless of what they might be.
The issue of Kosovo is much more delicate, so we believe that one should carefully approach to its solving. Bosnia-Herzegovina finds that the issue of Kosovo can only be reached trough negotiations, a compromise between Belgrade and Pristina, in accordance with the principles of the Contact Group.
We energetically reject making any kind of connection between Kosovo and the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we think that it would bring catastrophic consequences to peace and stability in the region.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The progress our regional countries have achieved in the previous period has largely been achieved thanks to the perspective of becoming a member of the European Union that has become even more concrete two years ago, when five more Central European countries became full-fledged members of EU.
I think that you will agree with me when I say that the concrete perspective of membership in the European Union was the main driving force of the entire series of very delicate reforms conducted in our countries in the previous period.
The Central European region is another confirmation that the European integrative processes are the best ways to establish a permanent peace, stability and prosperity in our countries and the continent.
We fully understand certain internal problems that some of the European Union countries are currently facing with, but we believe that stopping the process of EU enlargement would be a mistake, that might lead to a new division of our continent.
Therefore, we believe that it is extremely important that one of the main messages of the today’s 13th summit of the Central European countries would be stressing out the necessity of continuation of a historical process of EU enlargement. Such a message is even more significant because among the participants of the today’s Summit are the countries that full-fledged members and co-founders of EU, as well as the countries that are heading toward the European Union.
It would be highly significant if our Summit sends a message about the need to liberalize, i.e. put an end to the visa regime, which constitutes a natural step toward the European Union.
Such messages would also be the best answers to the topic of the today’s Summit– the present and the future of Europe.
I would also like to use this opportunity to thank our host – the Republic of Bulgaria and to congratulate its entry in the European Union.
Thank you!”"

Speech by Borislav Paravac, the Member of the B-H Presidency
on occasion of celebrating the 14th anniversary of RSA and
Day of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (of the Republic of Srpska)
“Mr. President of the Republic of Srpska,
Gentlemen Presidents of the National Assembly an the RS Government
Your Excellencies,
Dear generals, officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces of B-H,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure and honour to greet you all and to congratulate the Regiment’s Day to the members of the Infantry regiment of the Republic of Srpska, and the 14th anniversary of foundation to all the members of the Army of the Republic of Srpska.
The Day of the Infantry Regiment of the Republic of Srpska, fostering the identity and the military heritage of the RS Army, and at the same time the heritage of the Serbian people, and the 14th anniversary of founding the Army of the Republic of Srpska, is a chance to remind ourselves about the time when the Serbian people in these areas was faced with a danger of a complete lose of its national sovereignty and identity, but is also a chance to point out the place and the role of our army in the Dayton Bosnia-Herzegovina and the current reform processes.
As a respond to the threats and danger on May 12, 1992, the Assembly of the Serbian people in B-H, during its session in Banjaluka, brought a decision that the people are to create their army for the purpose of protecting and defending the territory where they lived for centuries.
The RS Army, born from the people, together with its institutions and elected representatives in the four-year long armed and political fight and great sacrifices has defended the Republic of Srpska as the most valuable heritage and a guarantee in protecting the national and all other democratic rights and interests of the Serbian people.
After signing the Dayton Peace Agreement, the RS Army gave its enormous contribution to the implementation of that Agreement, building trust and cooperation between parties, building a permanent and sustainable peace on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In times of comprehensive reforms in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the RS Army, the RS Ministry of Defence and other institutions of the Republic of Srpska have actively participated in planning and conducting the reforms in the area of defence and the entire security sector, and all that for the purpose of bringing B-H closer to the European Union and other Euro-Atlantic integration.
The Army of the Republic of Srpska today has a completely different role and a position to be fully integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to adopt and apply the highest democratic and military standards in executing the missions and tasks, which will enable B-H to join the program Partnership for Peace and the full-fledged NATO Alliance membership.
The RS Army and its members in the joint command and units at the level of Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in units preparing for participating in the peace operations in the world, today, and in the future, will dignifiedly represent the Republic of Srpska and follow aims and goals of the foreign policy and defence of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In all these reform processes and the defence system reorganization, the Republic of Srpska and the Serbian people have not diminished their political and military importance in the B-H Armed Forces, because trough legal solutions, trough the regimental organisation of Armed forces, we have secured the identity of the Serbian people and the military heritage of the Army of the Republic of Srpska.
The adopted strategic and normative-legal documents at the level of B-H are fully ensuring the foundations for B-H getting accepted in the Partnership for Peace program, and afterwards the NATO Alliance membership.
The defence institutions and commands at the level of B-H must primarily be enabled for the efficient command over the Armed Forces, which is a prerequisite for achieving the strategically set goals, and the B-H Presidency, as a civil command, will provide help and support in building a unique structure and organization of the B-H Armed Forces.
The set goals in building the completely professional armed forces bind the political leadership to ensure conditions for raising the entire standard and quality of life of soldiers and officers, their permanent training and qualification, and modernisation of military funds as a prerequisite for conducting the defined mission and tasks.
I am convinced that the achieved results in building the system of defence and armed forces, as well as our responsibilities in getting closer to an active participation in the Euro-Atlantic integration, are also our opportunity to become a part of the collective security system and an active participant in building peace in the world.
Thank you for your attention.”

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, TEN YEARS AFTER DAYTON – ON ITS WAY TO BRUSSELS
“Mr. Director, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to express my pleasure with having this opportunity to address you today, at the prestigious University George Washington.
Bearing in mind that the Day of Victory over Fascism was celebrated worldwide yesterday and the day before, I wish to congratulate you this great holiday. The United States of America had an enormous significance and a great role in the victory over fascism.
When we all believed that the fascism has been beaten forever, the evil happened again. Horrible crimes in their worst form were being repeated in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the period of 1992-1995, perhaps even worse then in the Second World War.
The Fascism was repeated! How do we call over 500 mass tombs and over 2500 joint tombs found so far other then fascism! If not fascism, then how to call hundreds of camps and over thousands of destructed religious objects? Wasn’t it fascism the ethnic territory cleansing and the persecution of over a million citizens from their homes and hundreds of thousands of demolished, burnt and ravaged houses?
This is a chance to thank USA once again, which had had a decisive role in putting an end to a war and sufferings in B-H.
I thank you for helping to restore and establish a democratic and civil society in my country. USA is the largest individual donor with over one billion USD.
Some of your best sons, Ambassador Robert FRASER, Colonel Joseph CRUESEL and Nielson DREW, gave their lives in the mission of establishing the peace in my country. We will remember them with gratitude.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It has been ten years since the end of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and signing the Dayton Agreement. Bosnia-Herzegovina has come a long way –from a completely destroyed and ravaged country by war, to a country that started the negotiations with the European Union for signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement several months ago, i.e. a country that is certainly heading toward the EU and the NATO membership.
Bosnia-Herzegovina ten years ago, immediately after signing
the Dayton Agreement
Towns, settlements, economy, infrastructure, communication, all devastated, damaged or ruined. Bosnia-Herzegovina is split with war, entity or other lines of separation. On the field, three conflicted and well-armed armies, with around 500 thousand soldiers and 60 thousand members of the international military forces. Three large police forces, far from any professional and democratic standards.
State borders are porous. The freedom of movement limited. Crossing the entity lines considered as an act of bravery.
The legal system of Bosnia-Herzegovina is split and more connected with the neighbouring countries then internally. An intense presence and interference in the internal affairs from the neighbouring countries.
Over 2.2 million in exile and refugees (more then half of population). Their property destroyed, devastated or usurped. The return was inconceivable, and those who dared to return were putting their lives and health in danger. Some were even killed or wounded during such attempts.
The war criminals at large. The cooperation of a larger number of institutions (RS and the so-called Herceg-Bosna) with the Hague Tribunal almost inexistent. Over 27.000 missing persons.
The economic and social situation extremely difficult. Hundreds of thousands of pensioners, disabled veterans, families of shehits, killed and demobilised fighters without any kind of compensation. Those who were employed and receiving pay checks were rare, and the pension funds completely empty.
The State institutions virtually inexistent, and those that were established did not function. At the same time, entities and other para-institutions acting as a State in a State.
Bosnia-Herzegovina today, ten years after
Today, ten years after, Bosnia-Herzegovina is indisputable as a State and there are no any serious political forces anymore, in or outside of it that could bring its territorial integrity and sovereignty in question. Additional responsibilities and numerous institutions have been established at the State level.
A significant progress in the return of the exiled and refugees has been achieved. According to the UNHCR data, over a million (around 50%) of the exiled and refugees have returned so far. Taken property, although often destroyed and devastated, has almost fully been returned. Freedom of movement has been ensured, including safeguarding the returnees. The returnees are still facing many problems, starting at unemployment, the right to health care, education, pensions, etc.
The return re-establishes the multi-ethnic structure of the country, which also strengthens the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The macroeconomic stability has been ensured, with inflation as in the European Union. We have the strongest currency in the region. Compared to the post-war period, GDP has been tripled. The foreign exchange reserves have been increased 15 times and they amounted to 2.2 billion EUR last year. We regularly pay off our foreign debt amounting to 2.1 billion EUR (around 20% of GDP). Our banking system has been consolidated. The industrial production and foreign investments are in a constant growth, and we have seen a constant growth in public revenues.
Bosnia-Herzegovina on its way to the Euro-Atlantic integration
The beginning of negotiations with the European Union in signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement represents the most important political event in our country after signing the Dayton Agreement ten years ago and signifies a definite transition of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the Dayton phase to the Brussels phase.
That was preceded by a completion of a great number of extremely difficult and complex reforms. Here, I would like to mention some of those: the border and the fiscal system reform, the establishment and development of a State Border Service, the unified Intelligence-security agency, the introduction of VAT, the PBS reform, the judicial system reform, etc.
We are conducting the defence system reform. Instead of the three mono-ethnic conflicted armies, we now have one multi-ethnic army. The Entities no longer have any jurisdiction over that matter, and the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina has professional, unified and multi-ethnic armed forces, organized according to the NATO standards. The Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina today have 12 thousand soldiers.
Only ten years ago, the world sent soldiers to our country, to help us to build peace and stability. Today, Bosnia-Herzegovina, within its powers of course, is sending its own soldiers to international peace missions. Our soldiers and police officers are today in Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leona and some other areas in crisis.
The reform and adjustment of our armed forces to the standards of the North-Atlantic Alliance is going very well. Bosnia-Herzegovina has a real chance to join the group of countries that will become the full-fledged members of NATO in 2008.
Joining the European Union and NATO is the main priority of our foreign policy. It is also, the best way to establish a permanent peace and stability not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in the entire region of the Southeastern Europe.
We hope that by the end of this year, we will have ended the negotiations and signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
We are fully aware that meeting the requirements for entering the European Union is primarily in our country’s and our citizen’s interest, so that we could ensure a prosperous future for our children and the future generations.
Therefore, we support the EU’s insistence on meeting the set requirements strictly, as when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as to other candidate countries. This especially refers to a request for an unconditional cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, i.e. arresting the war criminals still at large.
Here, I primarily mean arresting Karadzic and Mladic who are, besides Slobodan Milosevic, the personification of crime and sufferings in these areas.
The extradition of Karadzic and MLadic to the Hague Tribunal would finally close a war chapter of our history. It would enable hundreds of thousands of their direct and indirect victims to finally find peace and commit themselves to a normal life. Their arrest would surely set loose a new bulk of positive energy, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as in the entire region.
How we treat the war crime and criminal is the most important issue not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the entire region. It is not enough to arrest Karadzic, Mladic and other suspects indicted by the Hague Tribunal! It is necessary that the local administration of justices processes several hundreds (perhaps even thousands!) of other criminals. It is inadmissible that in today’s Europe, or anywhere else in the world, the war criminals are being considered national heroes, and the crime being justified with the so-called ethnic interest! There is no excuse for that!
Gradually though, the war crime awareness and the attitude toward criminals is changing. Besides the Hague Tribunal, the domestic courts are also processing the war crimes. The Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been established, whose task is to take over a certain number of cases from the Hague Tribunal and process the most responsible ones for war crimes.
Around 12.000 missing persons have been exhumed from over 400 mass tombs found so far.
The process of meeting the requirements on our way to the European Union could be going even faster. The problem lies also in the existing constitutional structure of the country. Bosnia-Herzegovina has a dysfunctional and expensive political system, a weak State and strong Entities.
We have started the process of constitutional reforms. We have achieved a political agreement of six largest political parties on modalities of the first phase of constitutional reforms. The Agreement was supported by the majority of citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the convincing majority of our Parliament’s members. Unfortunately, we have not been able to achieve the two thirds of votes necessary for the change of the Constitution. Still, that has not disheartened us! The Constitutional reforms will be our obligation in the following period, because that is good for our country’s future.
The relations with neighbours and Bosnia-Herzegovina in the region
I would like to say something about the relations with our neighbours and the situation in the entire region of the Southeastern Europe.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has fully understood the message from Brussels saying that the regional cooperation is a key for institutionalisation of relations of our countries with the European Union. In that course, we are supporting the idea of establishing a free trade zone of the West Balkan countries.
Ten years after the end of the war, we have mostly normalised the relations with both of our neighbours – Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Unfortunately, all the necessary agreements (the borders, the property-legal affairs) have not been signed something.
We have full diplomatic relations with the both countries; we have signed a great number of bilateral agreements in various domains, including the agreements on free trade. Citizens of our three countries can travel to Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro with nothing but an ID card.
As you can see, a lot has been done. Parallel with the further contractual regulation of relations, I believe that it is necessary to intensify efforts on improving the infrastructural connection between our three countries. This is particularly because during the last 80 years, a unified infrastructure was being built within one joint country.
On this occasion, I would also like mention two open issues in our region: the upcoming referendum in Montenegro and the issue of resolving the Kosovo status.
When it comes to the referendum in Montenegro, I am convinced that both parties will fully comply with the rules established by EU, and that there will not be any major problems, regardless of the result of the referendum.
The Kosovo issue is far more complex and that is why one should be more careful when it comes to solving it. Bosnia-Herzegovina finds that it should be solved through compromise and dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
However, we energetically reject any attempt of making any connection between the Kosovo status and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Any such attempt would directly jeopardize the peace and stability of the entire region and would impose the unforeseeable negative consequences.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Equality, tolerance and respect for differences are the foundations of the modern democratic world and values that European Union is based on, as well as the multi-century tradition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place where four great monotheistic religions have met, bringing to our country and its citizens all the splendour of their cultures and traditions, as one of the rare autochthonous European multi-ethnic societies.
In virtually every B-H city, side by side, for hundreds of years, stand a Catholic and an Orthodox church, a mosque, somewhere even a synagogue. Our peoples have learned to live in peace and tolerance together, and wars in our country were consequences of the world and/or regional wars, larger or minor interventions from the neighbouring countries. Such was also the case in the period of 1992-1995.
This is why we are very proud of our differences and our multi-ethnicity, which we consider our greatest wealth and a comparative advantage. The uniqueness of differences, as a continuous process, is a part of living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Among else, and perhaps even because of it, Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the rare countries, which has very good relations as with European Union and USA, as well as with China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Now, I would like to address you as a member of the B-H Presidency from the Bosniac people, i.e. as a Bosnian Muslim.
In today’s world, more and more often we could here those talking about the clash of civilisations and the impossibility of different religions’ co-existence. In that context, Muslims are the ones being mentioned most often, especially after the terrorist attacks on the United States of America of September 11, 2001, considering Islam to be a religion for terrorism.
Based on an example of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnian Muslims, such theories are being discarded because they are unfounded.
The Bosniacs, i.e. the Bosnian Muslims, are the autochthonous European people practising Islam at least for 600 years. After the withdrawal of the Great Turkish Empire from our territories 130 years ago, our people has several times been a victim of mass crimes, genocide and persecution, especially during the two world wars and the regional conflicts. The last one in a row of such demise of the Bosnian Muslims was in a period of 1992-1995, when over 10% of the Muslim population was murdered, i.e. around 70% of the killed in this war.
Even though we have suffered the most, we have never reached for retribution, especially not for terrorism as a method of fight. Terrorism is immoral and counterproductive. It is immoral because the innocent suffer, and it is counterproductive because it does not solve, but complicate the problems.
Like war criminals and criminals, terrorists do not have any religion or nation. They are always only terrorists and criminals.
We, thank God, have defended our country and people in the past war; we have preserved our religious and cultural tradition, and stayed an autochthonous Europeans.
Regardless of the sufferings, we have survived, also thanks to our neighbours the Serbs – Orthodox and the Croats – Catholics. We have adjusted our religion of Islam – and our culture, to the environment and conditions we are living in, and that is why we are recognized in the world as Bosnian or European Muslims. Together with other B-H peoples and citizens, we are building our joint homeland, where everyone will be equal and free, regardless of their religious, ethnic or any other membership.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Although we sometimes complained about the West not stopping the war and genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina on time, still it was the West, lead by the United States of America that helped put an end and stopped further sufferings, especially of the Bosnian Muslims, which were in the most difficult position. If there had not been for your engagement, the military intervention in B-H, everything would have been worse.
The United States of America, together with others, have stopped the genocide from happening in other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as was the one committed in Srebrenica.
I am not saying this only here, in the USA, but everywhere and on every occasion. That is the truth, we are appreciating it and we are grateful to you, and the world needs to know it! I have already repeated this statement two times at the Summits of the countries of the Islamic Conference Organization in Kuala Lumpur and Mecca, as well as during the official visits to Pakistan and Iran.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, as in the United States, a vision of a modern, reintegrated, multi-ethnic State, based on equal opportunities and rights for all its citizens always wins. The citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are successfully taking the historical test of co-existence of various religions and cultures. We are on a good way to achieve it. Therefore, we still need your help and I hope you will provide it.
Thank you!”"
20356,H Presidency Member Ivo Miro Jovic’s speech at the International Conference “ESTABLISHING THE TRUTH IN THE POST,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=20356&langTag=en-US,2006-05-05,"For every citizen of this country, undoubtedly, the Dayton Peace Agreement has put an end to the war agony and opened real possibilities for restoring the life in this area.
“Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear friends,
For every citizen of this country, undoubtedly, the Dayton Peace Agreement has put an end to the war agony and opened real possibilities for restoring the life in this area. Two elements of this Agreement have had a special task: punishing everyone who committed a war crime and the refugees’ and displaced persons’ right to return.
The Dayton Peace Agreement blemishes became fully expressed due to the failure to implement its provisions. It happened within these two most important items. The problem of uncompleted return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes is dangerous to the establishment of a permanent peace and co-existence. For example, in Bosnia-Herzegovina today, there are over 45% of Croats missing – a modern history in the world does not recognize such a ratio of persecution or genocide! This problem deserves a proper attention, but we will talk about it at some other event. We are here today to talk about the problem of punishing, or unpunishing, the perpetrators of war crimes as a precondition of the normalization of situation in the West Balkan and its Europeanization. Identification, arresting and processing the war criminals is precisely the first precondition for the countries of this region on their way to Euro-Atlantic integration. However, it is the attitude toward the war criminals where we can notice a true attitude of some countries toward the European principles. The fact that two of the most wanted criminals, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are not in Den Haag yet– only confirms the insincerity of all the factors in this process. This attitude becomes even more evident when it comes to presenting the investigators with the relevant documents, which could be of a great importance to the Tribunal’s work.
In addition, while on one hand, we only have the ignorant attitude toward the Tribunal and the European Union existing without any significant sanctions, on the other hand, we have the cooperation and collaboration left without any appropriate results.
Regardless of the fact that since the establishment of the Tribunal there were certain signs that the Tribunal could primarily be a political court, I belong to those who believe that the Tribunal, trough its work, righteousness and adherence to principles, will give its best respond to its critics.
In spite of accepting all the difficulties that the Tribunal has stumbled upon, we are deeply disappointed with the unequal treatment in certain processes.
It is unacceptable that not even a single criminal has been charged at the Tribunal for the Croatian demise in the Central Bosnia. It is similar to other Croatian agonies such as in Grabovica, Uzdol, Bugojno, Kriazancevo selo etc.
It is incomprehensible that the authority of that time, as was Enver Hadzihasanovic, the Commander of the Third Corp, to this day has not been made responsible for the murder of a single civilian – Croat, even though there were four hundred and twelve (412) killed and over fifty (50) killed Serbs on the territory of the Third Corps’ military jurisdiction and he has been indicted for only one (1)? In addition, existence of 40 camps for Croats has been proven.
I wonder if the numerous evidences, witnesses’ testimonies, as well as the FB-H Army documents are found irrelevant by the Hague Tribunal, when the numerous crimes have been left out of the verdict?! Considering that this Court has finished with investigations, and that the domestic administration of justice in the territory of the Central Bosnia has not convicted even a single member of the B-H Army for a crime over Croats, I am afraid that these crimes could easily remain unpunished! This is where the role of the institutions of authority is indispensable, but also the role of media who have to show a lot more investigative journalism sensitivity and the responsibility for the written, given to citizens with a hope for better future.
A frightening message has been sent to people expecting justice, because besides the question whether there is justice, there is also a question of is that an encouragement to the perpetrators saying that when a crime gets unpunished it can be repeated!? People are humiliated because their victims were taken too lightly. For killings, plunder, arson and home destruction, desecration of religious facilities and a great population persecution, NO ONE IS GUILTY and they are wondering, should not the Court exist for making a judgement honourably?
All this points to the fact that in the future, we must dedicate ourselves more to investigations and processing the perpetrators of war crimes, in order to meet the justice, to give the victims at least the moral satisfaction, and to create conditions for the establishment of trust between our peoples. That is our great responsibility, because war crime does not have a time limit, and because of the future generations that should live in a different milieu. In that regard, all of us, especially the investigators, have a great task of uncovering and affirming the truth. Only the truth, no matter how unreachable it might be for those seeking it, is the only firm foundation of our future co-existence.”"
20192,H Presidency Chairman’s speech at the Summit of Heads of State and Governments of the Southeast European countries,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=20192&langTag=en-US,2006-05-04,"“Presidents and Prime Ministers,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I would also like to congratulate our host for an excellent organization of this Summit and for the given hospitality.
I would like to express my pleasure with intensification of cooperation in our region and the fact that all our countries are undoubtedly coming closer to the goal fulfilment – the EU and NATO membership.
Some countries are to become members next year, some have started negotiations on the full-fledged membership, some have gained or are awaiting the candidate status, and some have started negotiations on signing the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement. We are all heading in the same direction, faster or slower.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This is also an opportunity to inform you about the achieved progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have started the negotiations with the European Union for signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The negotiations are going well and we are expecting to sign this Agreement by the end of this year or the beginning of the next. We are conducting the comprehensive reform of the defence system for the reason of adjusting to the NATO standards. Instead of three mono-ethnic armies, we are establishing one professional, de-politicized and multi-ethnic army. Bosnia-Herzegovina is not only a receiver, but also a giver of military assistance. Our military and police units are participating in the international peace mission in Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Eritrea, etc. We are expecting that Bosnia-Herzegovina will be accepted in the Partnership for Peace by the end of the year, and will be invited to join the NATO in 2008.
Both these things mean reforming the police, public broadcasting system, certainly the unconditional cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, including arresting the most wanted war criminals. I hope that we, together with others, would soon fulfil this commitment. It is primarily in our interest, because only on the foundations of truth and justice, we can build a better future.
We started the process of constitutional reforms and achieved an agreement on modalities of the first phase of changing our Constitution. This will mean a more efficient and functional authority that would significantly alleviate and accelerate not only the internal integration process, but also the EU and NATO membership. The Agreement received support from the largest part of citizens and the most members of the Parliament. Unfortunately, due to two votes, the amendments have not received the 2/3 majority and have not been adopted yet. Regardless, I hope that in the following period, these changes will be adopted.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Our countries have separately, but also jointly, invested great efforts and achieved a significant progress in order to change the stereotype of our region as a backward, problematic and a conflicted European suburb.
Our geographic positions, joint history, ethnic structure of population, infrastructural and economic ties, all refer us to a comprehensive cooperation. Different peoples, religions and cultures meet, intertwine and co-exist here in our region. We need to do everything to make our mutual understanding and tolerance an example to others.
Our region has progressed in the further economic connecting. I would like to emphasize the significance of the Agreement on joining the EU energetic market, the Agreement on enlargement of the free trade zone of the Central Europe with countries of the Southeastern Europe, the establishment of a highly profiled railroad network, the cooperation in the domain of fight against the organized crime, human trafficking and illegal emigrations. Most of the countries in our region are on its way to bring the border control regime in accordance with the EU and Schengen systems. I believe that the time has come for European Union to consider the possibilities of liberalisation, i.e. putting an end to the visa regime with the countries of our region. This would represent a significant support to our countries in conducting reforms and a message to citizens to support it.
Seeking to have a better coordination of our joint activities, primarily towards EU and NATO, but also between our countries, i think that the time has come to institutionalize this cooperation in a form of a permanent Secretariat. This Secretariat could be having an important role in the upcoming reform of the Stability Pact for the Southeastern Europe.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Bosnia-Herzegovina expresses pleasure with the fact that Serbia and Montenegro have come to a compromise on modalities of holding a referendum in accordance with the EU demands. We are convinced that the both sides will fully acknowledge the referendum results, regardless of what they might be. The issue of Kosovo is much more delicate and we believe that one should carefully approach to its solving.
To Kosovo status needs to be resolved trough negotiations and compromises between Belgrade and Pristina, in accordance with the set principles of the Contact Group. We energetically reject any kind of association of the Kosovo status with the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The EU membership perspective has been a driving force in conducting a series of highly delicate but crucial reforms in our countries. The region of the Southeastern Europe is a confirmation that the European integrative processes are the best way to establish a permanent peace and stability.
Therefore, I find that one of the main messages of today’s Summit should be underlining the need for continuation of a historical enlargement of EU with the West Balkan countries. That is primarily in the interest of the regional countries, but also in the interest of the European Union countries in the long-term. Furthermore, we should send a message about the need to liberalize or put an end to the visa regime as a natural follow-up on the region’s road to EU.
I use this opportunity to thank our host – the Republic of Greece on its successful chairmanship over EU, which has constantly supported the West Balkan countries in their coming closer to the European Union and NATO, and I wish the Republic of Croatia to have a successful chairmanship over the next period.
Thank you.”"

""Excellencies,
Ministers,
Generals,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The basic goals and directions of the foreign policy of Bosnia-Herzegovina are represented by a full-fledged membership of the European Union, joining the NATO program Partnership for peace and a full-fledged membership of NATO alliance.
Previous experiences in joining the European Union show that joining the NATO program Partnership for Peace and the NATO membership is one of the pre-requisites for entering the European Union. We find that our road to NATO has no alternative and is our foreign policy’s priority at this moment, more so because such a decision is also shared by our neighbours Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Croatia, which increases the stability of the entire region of the West Balkan.
The defence reform and the reform of the entire security sector, which we have completed successfully and which were the conditions for entering the Euro-Atlantic integration, could not have been possible without the professional and material help from NATO at large, especially the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo.
It is my pleasure to state today that our efforts in the defence reform and the cooperation with NATO in that area have resulted in building a unique defence system and unified armed forces, and that we have basically fulfilled all the professional and technical conditions for joining the program Partnership for Peace.
I would also like to express my pleasure with the opportunity to place the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo in a quality premises and that defence structures at the state level, first of all the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Joint Headquarters, are to continue their even more successful cooperation in implementing the reform solutions in the area of defence and fulfilling the requirements toward the full-fledged NATO alliance membership.
I use this opportunity to thank General Weber and all his predecessors who commanded the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo for their unselfish help, as well as to express hope that today we are opening a new page of cooperation with NATO on the foundations of a true friendship and partnership.
Thank you""

between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Holy See
Sarajevo, April 19, 2006
“Eminent Cardinal,
Your Excellency, the Nuncio in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Representatives of the religious communities,
Father bishops,
Father provincials,
Authority representatives,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my great pleasure to greet you today on occasion of signing the Basic Agreement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Holy See. This is a result of work and efforts of the representatives of the both signatory sides, with which they legally frame the relations between the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Catholic Church. This confirms the future cooperation, which aims at the spiritual and material development of man, as well as promoting the common good.
This Agreement has a special importance to Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the right to religious freedom is being confirmed trough it, which is extremely important to this country that aspires to become recognisable by cherishing the religious tolerance, the respect for each other and respecting the differences. Bosnia-Herzegovina has undoubtedly chosen the European path, wishing to ensure its peoples and citizens to enjoy all the rights defined with the international democratic standards. By signing this Agreement, the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina acquires an additional international credibility in the international relations, as a European democratic community.
This way, the Holy See and Bosnia-Herzegovina will confirm, once again, the high degree of cooperation and a mutual friendship, and that is something we have Holy Father John Paul II to thank, who showed his deep affection to Bosnia-Herzegovina during the most difficult times of war.
I would like to emphasize the significance of this Agreement for the Catholic people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who have lived for the Catholic religion for centuries, which was a part of their identity, and at the same time a part of the European civilisation, and this makes Bosnia-Herzegovina a part of Europe not only geographically.
I am convinced that such or similar agreements would soon be signed with other Churches and religious communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well, which will contribute to a better mutual understanding.
Your Excellency,
I especially send greetings to Holy Father Benedict XVI, with a sincere invitation to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Finally, I would like to thank all those who gave their contribution to the creation of this document and preparations for signing it today"

of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
Sarajevo, April 17, 2006
“Dear families of shehits and killed members of the RB-H Army,
Disabled veterans, demobilized fighters!
Gentlemen soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers,
Gentlemen generals,
I congratulate you your 14th anniversary of forming the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina!
I congratulate you the Day of the 2nd Infantry-ranger regiment of the Armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina. With its forming and quality work, we will preserve the tradition of our Army, keep our honour and the multi-ethnicity and universality of goals it fought for.
The Second infantry and ranger regiment has a task to cherish the highest values and goals, for which the RB-H Army has fought as a legal army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is Bosnia-Herzegovina, a State of equal peoples and citizens – Croats, Serbs, Bosniacs and others.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Thank you for answering our invitation and confirming, together with us, that the memories of the defenders of our homeland, Bosnia-Herzegovina, are still alive. This is an opportunity to promise, once again, to continue to defend the values for which our best sons gave their lives, and that we will provide care for the families of shehits, killed fighters and disabled veterans.
Today, 10 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia-Herzegovina is undeniable as a State! No longer are any serious political forces inside or outside of Bosnia-Herzegovina that could endanger its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Your responsibility is to preserve it permanently.
We are conducting comprehensive reforms in all the important segments, starting with the fiscal, administrative, security and defence system.
We have reached an agreement on the first phase of the constitutional system reform. It means that we will have a stronger State, a more functional and efficient power. It is a result of agreement between the domestic political forces.
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the joint State of Bosniacs, Serbs, Croats and others, must be built by agreement. It can and should be organized in the way that representatives of all our peoples and citizens will agree on. There must not be any imposing or outvoting, but we must make compromise and built consensus in order to ensure a better future for our children.
The Armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been and will be a continuity of an idea of a free, independent and prosperous Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has enough room for all its peoples and citizens.
Even now, with its structure and training, and with its equipment tomorrow, the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina represent a guarantor of peace and prosperity in our country and its quality membership in the security structure of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic space. The transitional process, in which the Armed Forces are today, is a process of its continued progress toward NATO and growth into the factor of stability and security of the region. Establishment of the efficient chain of command, a permanent acquiring of knowledge and skills, accepting the modern standards and operative procedures, will make our Armed Forces more mobile, efficient and economically affordable.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This is also and opportunity to thank the NATO and the International Community for support and assistance in the establishment of the State defence institutions, as well as for willingness to help us in the process of implementation of reform laws and decisions. I also find the support trough the NATO Trust Fund in taking care of numerous members of the Armed Forces important, as well as educating the young officers and comprehensive strengthening of probably the youngest armed forces in Europe.
Thanks to the achieved progress, Bosnia-Herzegovina is no longer a receiver today, but is also capable to be a giver of international military assistance. The Armed Forces units are participating in the international missions worldwide.
Gentlemen soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers,
Gentlemen generals,
You are expected to show maturity, seriousness, a military responsibility and loyalty to your homeland in execution of given tasks. Our goal is to be accepted in the Partnership for peace, i.e. the NATO and to attain the European Union membership. Only within the Euro-Atlantic democratic institutions, we can ensure the prosperity and security.
The State structures bear the responsibility to create conditions for the Armed forces’ functioning and the execution of the function that is defined by the Constitution and laws.
This way is the best way to show our gratitude and respect to all the fighters of our State of Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially to those who gave their lives and health in that name."

I am glad that you have come to visit my country. That is a symbol of friendship between our countries and a confirmation of my country’s sovereignty, not only on land, but also in the territorial waters of the Adriatic Sea.
The visit of your battle ship and of US Navy and German ships has confirmed that Bosnia-Herzegovina is a part of the family of maritime countries. That certainly meant ensuring the free passage to our territorial waters.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The friendship between B-H and France has a permanent value. We cannot and must not forget what France has done for B-H.
Eighty-four French soldiers gave their lives for the establishment of peace in our country. They will remain in our memories forever.
If it is any consolation, today, ten years after the establishment of peace, we can say that their sacrifice had not been in vain.
The established peace has never been violated. B-H is on the right way to the Euro-Atlantic integration. We are conducting strong reforms. We are integrating the society. We are restoring the multi-ethnic structure of our country. We are building the unity of differences. B-H citizens are on the right way to pass an examination of a mutual life of different religions and cultures. That is a result of a joint life of our peoples, and it is several centuries long.
Today, our military and police forces are participating in the international peace missions all over the world. B-H is no longer a receiver, but also a giver of international military assistance.
We expect that by the end of the year the EU Stabilization and Association Agreement will be signed, as well as our country’s admission to the NATO program Partnership for peace.
We will all make additional efforts to meet the existing requirements, including arresting the war criminals at large, which the Hague Tribunal insists on. This will open a perspective of B-H becoming a full-fledged member of NATO in 2008.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Our satisfaction with your visit is even greater due to the fact that your visit has been realized in the scope of celebrating the 200 years of appointing the first French consul to B-H. 200 years ago, at the time of the Ottoman Empire, France appointed its consul, Mr. DAVID, with the headquarters in Travnik. That was also the first diplomatic mission in B-H.
Even then, France recognised the path our country has taken, which leads to the family of the European countries.
France was also the first country, which accredited an ambassador in the internationally recognised and independent B-H – in June of 1993. Citizens of Sarajevo, our Capital, will never forget that the first French ambassador, Mr. Henry Zakolen shared their hardest war days in the surrounded Sarajevo.
Finally, once again, welcome to B-H.
Long live the friendly Republic of France! Long live B-H!
Thank you!”"

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, TEN YEARS AFTER DAYTON-ON ITS WAY TO BRUSSELS
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please allow me to express my pleasure with having this opportunity to address you here at the prestigious CLINGENDAEL Institute in The Hague, which was attended by numerous diplomats, from Bosnia-Herzegovina as well.
For us in Bosnia-Herzegovina, The Hague has a special, symbolic meaning – as a headquarters of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice.
The role of these two international judicial institutions is irreplaceable in establishing the truth and the character of the war in B-H, and persecution of citizens. Only on foundations of truth and justice, we can build trust between people, peoples and countries in the region, and a better future for new generations.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Holland for their extremely significant help given to Bosnia-Herzegovina. With 324 million USD of bilateral aid and participation in European Union’s help to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Holland was certainly one of the most important donors during the reconstruction of our country.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It has been ten years since the war ended in Bosnia-Herzegovina and since the Dayton Agreement was signed. Bosnia-Herzegovina has gone a long way – from a completely destroyed and ravaged country, to a country that has started to negotiate with European Union on signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement several months ago, i.e. a country that confidently walks toward the EU and the NATO membership.
Bosnia-Herzegovina ten years ago, immediately after signing the Dayton Agreement
Towns, settlements, economy, infrastructure, communications were devastated, damaged or destroyed. Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided with war, entity or other lines of separation. On the field, there were three conflicted and well-armed armies, with around 500 thousand soldiers and 60 thousand members of the international military forces. There were three police forces, which were far from professional and democratic standards.
The State borders were porous. The freedom of movement limited. Crossing the entity lines was considered an act of bravery.
The legal system of Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided and more connected with neighbouring countries then internally. There was an intensive presence of neighbouring countries and their interference in the internal affairs.
War criminals at large. Cooperation of a number of institutions with the Hague Tribunal was almost inexistent and there were over 27.000 missing persons.
An economic and social situation was very difficult. Hundreds of thousands of pensioners, disabled veterans, soldiers’ families, killed or demobilised fighters without any indemnity. The employed people receiving salaries were rare, and pension funds were completely empty.
The State institutions were almost inexistent and those that were established did not function. At the same time, there were entities and other parainstitutions working as a country inside a country.
Bosnia-Herzegovina today, ten years after
Today, ten years after, Bosnia-Herzegovina is indisputable as a State and there are no serious political forces in it or outside that could endanger its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Additional authorities and numerous institutions at the State level have been established.
A significant progress in returns of refugees and displaced persons has been achieved. According to the UNHCR data, over a million (around 50%) refugees and displaced persons have returned so far. Property that was taken away, almost fully has been restored, though often destroyed and devastated. The freedom of movement is granted, including the security for returnees. The returnees still have many problems, starting with unemployment, rights to health care, education, pensions, etc.
Return means re-establishing the multi-ethnic structure of the country, which also strengthens the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The macroeconomic stability has been ensured, with inflation as in the European Union. We have the strongest currency in the region. Compared to the post-war period, GDP has been tripled. Foreign exchange reserves have been increased 15 times and they amounted to 2.2 billion EUR last year. We pay off our foreign debt regularly which amounts to 2.1 billion EUR (around 20% of GDP). Our banking system has been consolidated. Industrial production and foreign investments are in a constant growth, and we have also seen a continuous growth in public revenues in percentages exceeding 10%.
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the European path
The beginning of negotiations with the European Union for signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement represents the most important political event in our country after signing the Dayton Agreement ten years ago and symbolises Bosnia-Herzegovina’s transition from the Dayton to the Brussels phase.
The realization of a number of extremely difficult and complex reforms preceded to it. I would like to mention some of them: customs and fiscal system reform, establishment and development of the State Border Service, the united Intelligence Agency, introduction of VAT, the PBS reform, judicial system reform, etc.
We are also conducting the defence system reform. Instead of three mono-ethnic confronted armies, we now have one multi-ethnic army. Entities no longer have any jurisdiction in that matter, and the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina has professional, united and multi-ethnic armed forces, organized according to the NATO standards. The Armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina have 12.000 soldiers today, and it had 500.000 soldiers in 1995.
Only ten years ago, the world sent soldiers to our country, to help us build peace and stability. Today, Bosnia-Herzegovina, within its possibilities of course, is sending its soldiers to international peace missions. Today, our soldiers and police officers are in Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone and a few more conflicted regions.
Reforming and adjusting our armed forces to the standards of the North-Atlantic Alliance is going very well. Bosnia-Herzegovina has a real chance to join the group of countries that will become full-fledged members of NATO in 2008.
Joining the European Union and NATO is our country’s main priority. This is, at the same time, the best way to establish a permanent peace and stability, not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in the entire region of Southeastern Europe.
We hope that by the end of this year we will have ended the negotiations and signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement.
We are fully aware that meeting the requirements for entering the European Union is primarily in the interest of our country and citizens, so that we could ensure a prosperous future for our children and future generations.
This is why we support EU’s insistence on a strict fulfilment of given requirements by Bosnia-Herzegovina and by other candidate countries as well. This especially refers to the request for an unconditional cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, i.e. arresting the war criminals.
I primarily mean arresting Karadzic and Mladic, who are, besides Slobodan Milosevic, the personification of crime and death in our region.
The extradition of Karadzic and Mladic to the Hague Tribunal would finally close the war chapter of our history. This would allow hundreds of thousands of their direct and indirect victims to finally find their peace and commit themselves to a normal life. Their arrest would certainly set loose a new quantity of a positive energy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as in the entire region.
How we treat war crimes and criminals is the most important issue not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in the entire region. It is not enough to arrest Karadzic, Mladic and others accused by the Hague Tribunal! It is necessary that local administration of justice processes several hundreds (perhaps even thousands!) of other criminals. It is inadmissible in today’s Europe, or anywhere else in the world, to have war criminals considered to be national heroes and to justify the crime with the so-called ethnic interests!
The war crime awareness and position toward criminals, is being gradually changed though. Apart from the Hague Tribunal, domestic courts are also processing the war crimes. The Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been founded, whose task is to take over a certain quantity of cases from the Hague Tribunal and to process those who are the most responsible for war crimes.
Around 12.000 missing persons have been exhumed from over 400 mass tombs found so far.
The process of meeting the requirements in order to join European Union and NATO could be going even faster. The problem is also in the current constitutional structure of the country. Bosnia-Herzegovina has a non-functional and expensive political system, a weak State and strong Entities.
After a couple of month of intensive discussions, the most important political parties in our country have recently reached an agreement on modalities of the first phase of constitutional changes. Agreed changes mean a strong State and institutions that are more functional. This will allow Bosnia-Herzegovina to fulfil all commitments in its European path without being disturbed.
I expect that by the end of the month, the Parliament will adopt these amendments. The greatest value of this agreement is that it was a result of the domestic politicians’ agreement, without any pressure from the international community that we have got used to. We have agreed that this will be the first phase, and after the election, there will be a second phase of constitutional reforms.
Relations with neighbours and Bosnia-Herzegovina in the region
Bosnia-Herzegovina has fully understood the message from Brussels that the regional cooperation is a key for institutionalisation of relations of the countries in our region with the European Union. In that course, we support the idea of establishing the free trade zone of Western Balkan countries.
Ten years after the end of the war, we have mostly normalized the relations with both of our neighbours – Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Unfortunately, we still haven’t signed and verified all the necessary bilateral agreements.
We have full diplomatic relations with the both countries; we have signed a great number of bilateral agreements in various domains, including the agreements on free trade. The citizens of our three countries can travel to Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro with nothing but an ID card.
As you can see, a lot has been done. Parallel with the further contractual regulation of relations, I believe that it is necessary to intensify the efforts on improving the infrastructural connection between our three countries. This is particularly because during the last 80 years, a unique infrastructure was being built within one joint country.
In regard to the referendum in Montenegro, I am convinced that both parties will fully comply with the rules established by EU, and that there will not be any major problems, regardless of the result of the referendum.
The Kosovo issue is far more complex and that is why one should be more careful when it comes to solving it. Bosnia-Herzegovina finds that it should be solved through compromise and dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
However, we energetically reject any attempt of making any connection between the Kosovo status and Bosnia-Herzegovina and its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Any such attempt would directly jeopardize the peace and stability of the whole region and would have unforeseeable negative consequences.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Equality, tolerance and respect for differences are the foundations of a modern democratic world and values that European Union is based on, but also the multi-century tradition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place where four great monotheistic religions have met, bringing our country and its citizens all the splendour of their cultures and traditions, as one of the rare autochthonous European multi-ethnic societies.
In virtually every B-H city, side by side, for hundreds of years, stand a Catholic and an Orthodox church, a mosque, somewhere even a synagogue. Our peoples have learned to live in peace and tolerance together, and wars in our country were consequences of the world and/or regional wars, larger or minor interventions from the neighbouring countries. Such was also the case in the period of 1992-1995.
This is why we are very proud of our differences and our multi-ethnicity, which we consider our greatest wealth and a comparative advantage. The uniqueness of differences, as a continuous process, is a part of living in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Among else, and because of it, Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the rare countries, which has very good relations as with European Union and USA, as well as with China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of our difficulties, the vision of a modern, united Europe, based on equal possibilities and rights for all its citizens, always wins. This is the only future for B-H and for the entire our continent.
Only such Europe would definitely be an oasis of peace, stability and prosperity, where all its citizens, regardless of their ethnic, religious or cultural membership, would feel at home and be proud of the European unity of differences.
Positive processes in B-H and the region I have been telling you about are, among else, a result of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s and the regional countries’ choosing such an idea of Europe.
The European Union should not waste the given chance to realize such a vision of our continent. On account of that, regardless of the difficulties and the current complex internal situation in some of the member countries, a historic process of enlarging the European Union must be continued.
We must not forget that it was the establishment of a permanent peace and stability in at that time destroyed and divided Europe, that were the main guiding ideas of the founder of what European Union is today. The previous history of European integration showed that those visionaries were right.
Today, half a century later, EU and its members have the opportunity to ensure a permanent peace, stability and prosperity in the entire our continent by continuing to enlarge the Union.
I am convinced that the Kingdom of Holland, as one of the EU founder countries, will support this historic project, providing it with a significant contribution.
Thanks.”"

on occasion of dinner, organized by
Chairman Tihic and Members of the Presidency Paravac and Jovic
in honour of the President of Turkey
“Mr. President and dear friends!
Allow me to greet you once again, in the name of the B-H Delegation, and to welcome you to our country.
Meetings between the Turkish and B-H businessmen were a very good introduction to this visit. I expect it to be a very significant stimulus to the entire economic cooperation, which doesn’t fail to keep up with the friendly relations of our countries.
Your visit, Mr. President, confirmed the continued cooperation and visit exchange at the highest level. I am convinced that this will lead to a further development and strengthening our friendly relations and establishment of concrete cooperation in all areas.
Bosnia-Herzegovina and our citizens appreciate and will always remember the unselfish help, which the Republic of Turkey and your people have given to us in the bygone times. Turkey also played a very important role in the process that ended the war in our country.
Your soldiers participated in peace missions, during the war and after. Turkey significantly helped the reconstruction of our country. Besides that, the friendly Turkey has been continuously providing the important diplomatic support to Bosnia-Herzegovina and our lobbying to be accepted at International organisations, primarily the NATO.
The Republic of Turkey is also a country with whom Bosnia-Herzegovina has signed the most of bilateral agreements. Our countries also have a very good cooperation in the area of defence.
Mr. President,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey bear many similarities and have a lot in common –history, cultural heritage, architecture, cuisine, even the significant percentage of words originating from the Turkish and other Oriental languages, which have grown together with our language and become a part of it.
I am convinced that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey have a joint future within the European Union, NATO and other Euro-Atlantic structures.
It is certain that much needs to be done on the path of our two countries to Brussels. However, this journey will be easier if we establish an even stronger and complete cooperation.
Allow me to wish our countries and peoples a prosperous future and a permanent, unbreakable friendship, and you, Mr. President, I wish a good health and success in leading the Republic of Turkey.
Long live Bosnia-Herzegovina! Long live the Republic of Turkey!""
“Dear Chairman and Member of the Presidency,
Esteemed guests,
I am happy to be in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I thank you for the warm hospitality that has been given to us from the moment we have arrived in Sarajevo.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country with whom Turkey has strong historic, cultural and human connections and with whom it cherishes excellent relations in all areas. In the heart of the Turkish people, Bosnia-Herzegovina has always had a special place. A great number of our citizens originating from Bosnia-Herzegovina make our connections even stronger.
Turkey has always concretely supported sovereignty, territorial integrity and multi-ethnic structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina. With this kind of approach, Turkey has given its contribution to the process of security and stability that started after signing the Dayton Peace Agreement, as well as in comprehensive efforts to reconstruct the country. Our unit called “Altea”, stationed within EUFOR in Zenica, continues with its self-sacrificing work in order to establish a permanent peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
For a long period, Bosnia-Herzegovina was being remembered by war and terrible sufferings. I am happy that during this visit I was able to see that things have started to change, that Bosnia-Herzegovina has become a dynamic country, which can achieve the new and comprehensive changes, tries to achieve social prosperity, aiming at integration with the Euro-Atlantic institutions. We approvingly monitor and support these progresses.
The fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina left behind the “Dayton period”, which symbolised the efforts toward reconstruction and stability, and has entered the “Brussels period”, which symbolises the Euro-Atlantic orientation, connects our countries in common goal. I believe that the goal we share will stimulate us to develop relations with our neighbours, to build the future on the foundations of tolerance, agreement and mutual understanding.
Today, one of our fundamental values we pay so much attention to, is co-existence of different cultures, confessions and ethnicities. Strengthening the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural structure of Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on wishes of its constituent peoples to live in peace together, represents a significant contribution not only to stability of the country and the region, but to peace in Europe as well. Turkey will be the proudest of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a country developing in peace and stability, within the European family.
Dear Chairman and Presidency Members,
During today’s discussions, we have comprehensively examined our bilateral relations, which are at a very high level. We have evaluated steps to be taken in order to raise the level of our trade exchange, which amounted to two hundred million dollars last year, to reach a level that could reflect the real possibilities of our countries. In Turkey, day after day, grows businessmen’s interest to invest in Bosnia-Herzegovina. More and more often our businessmen meet, which confirms our wish to develop economic relations between Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that our deep friendship will transform economic relations into a true partnership and will serve a joint interest.
Dear Chairman and Presidency Members,
During today’s discussions, we were convinced that mutual understanding and trust, which govern our relations, are enabling a sincere approach to all topics. The duty of us officials is to use this favourable environment in the best possible way and to develop our relations in all areas to the greatest possible extent.
With these kinds of thoughts, I raise this glass to your health and happiness, in honour of the mutual prosperity of peoples of Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Serefe!"

at the 14th anniversary of founding the HVO,
in Mostar, April 7, 2006
“Mr. Commander,
The Patriot War disabled veterans,
The Gentlemen Generals,
The Gentlemen Guard members, non-commissioned officers and officers,
The Gentlemen representatives of the civilian and church authority, representatives of International organizations, EUFOR and media,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I greet you all at this gathering of recollection, love and pride, and I congratulate all members of HVO their 14th anniversary.
This is an opportunity to use the celebration of the 14th anniversary of HVO to be reminded about everything we started from, what we have gone trough during the last 14 years, to talk about the current situation and to recognise our nearer and farther political future.
The glorious path that HVO units went trough in preserving lives, homes and the homeland, obliges us and demands from us not to forget those who made further fight possible for us, only by other means, in order to have a prettier and a more just B-H where Croats will be equal to other two peoples.
This kind of thinking gives us possibility to realistically recognise our political reality the Croatian people in B-H is going through, as well as are all previous institutions which are becoming the B-H institutions trough the reform transition, creating the legal supposition for B-H to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, at the same time preserving the identity of all three constituent peoples in B-H.
With these viewpoints, we have been building the defence system of HRHB, FB-H during the last 14 years, and today as well as in the future, we will be doing the same at the state level.
In all previous political processes, the defence structure of the Croatian component has had its organisational and structural changes, and it is why today we are in a position to have around 2.200-2.300 professional members of the B-H Armed Forces out of 10.000 professional members back in 1998.
These re-organisational processes have not diminished the political and military significance in the B-H Armed Forces because we have legally ensured the identity of the constituent peoples and the military heritage of HVO through the establishment of infantry regiment and recognisable symbols.
Besides the political significance of these reform processes, their social aspects are equally unavoidable, and the Croatian political leadership in B-H has attached a great importance to them, so I use this opportunity to ask the competent ones in the B-H Ministry of Defence to make additional efforts to take care of numerous members of the Armed Forces in a more quality manner, while the B-H Presidency will give them their full support.
After all these changes, we have a very important task in front of us, which is to build the defence system at the B-H State level.
During the system establishment, we will build a new work and relation quality within the Armed Forces, where the fundamental values in evaluating this quality will be the complete previous contribution, expertise and qualification for performing the duties and the showed degree of responsibility in performing the given tasks.
The strategic documents at the State level were made so far, which allowed B-H to create the legal basis for entry in the Partnership for Peace, and the NATO Alliance membership afterwards.
The defence institutions at the State level must primarily work on establishing the efficient command system in the Armed Forces, which is a key pre-requisite for achieving the strategically designated goals.
The B-H Presidency, as a Chief Commander, will give support to all these processes. For implementation of all these legal solutions, we also must have the most quality personal solutions in order to become an active factor in building these institutions. A very serious commitment that B-H has is participation of the B-H Armed Forces members in world peace missions.
This task is a task for the entire State leadership in B-H, and we must take this commitment responsibly and fully execute all given commitments.
For this purpose, all those that need to work in the Armed Forces must take up some general and military advancing in order to give their complete contribution to peace missions.
Our set goals in building the entirely professional armed forces bind the leadership of this country to ensure conditions for raising the entire living quality standard for soldiers, personnel education of non-commissioned officers and officers, equipment modernization, as fundamental pre-conditions for performing the defined mission of the Armed Forces to which they owe their existence.
I personally believe that upcoming commitments are also our chance, which we could use only by means of active participation in giving our contribution to complete international security. This way, B-H will ensure its active presence in the family of group security. Feeling proud of all members of all HVO units, I wish us to continue to celebrate our anniversaries that bear witness to a Croatian soldier in B-H.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please allow me,
Once again, to express sincere congratulations and gratitude to all HVO members, who were in our joint formation during the difficult war and post-war times, and due to objective reasons, they could not be with us today.
To all killed HVO members, the Patriot war disabled veterans and their families, I wish to say one sincere and humane “thanks” for the sacrifice they made in fight for survival and freedom of Croats in B-H, because they completely fulfilled their task.
May we have a happy 14th anniversary of HVO.
I wish you a healthy life, may dear God bless you all.

Speech of Ivo Miro Jovic, the Member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina
At the opening of the Trade Fair “Mostar 2006”
In Mostar, April 4, 2006
""Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to greet you today at the opening of the International Trade Fair “Mostar 2006”. This event has grown to a significant economic manifestation, not only within the limits of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but within the entire region as well.
This year also, through participation of over five hundred presenters from group of around 30 countries worldwide, this fair confirms the need for its organization and further enhancement, and economic and political institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina must give its support to it.
This year, the Republic of Hungary will present itself as a partner country of the B-H economy, and its experience as a young member of European Union can be of use to us in that area.
We in Bosnia-Herzegovina find it clear that the economic growth is essential for ensuring the overall stability in the country. Achieving this goal demands us to define the economic perspective and to provide additional efforts to accelerate our European path. We in Bosnia-Herzegovina must believe that we can work, produce, export and open more job positions to a greater extent and with better quality than we are doing today.
For these effects, we must express our country’s willingness to step forward sufficiently good and fast in its transformation, accepting all transitional challenges. Therefore, economic and institutional reforms have no alternative. All of us called to do it by means of our position, must create pre-conditions for forming the unique economic space, which is also a task given to us by the European Commission. Unless we do it, we will miss our given chance for complete prosperity of our citizens.
The progress made by Bosnia-Herzegovina so far shows that we still have not achieved the necessary level of economic growth, however we can say that by acting, we could be an active participant of all economic processes in the region and wider.
We must see our chance in resources that Bosnia-Herzegovina unquestionably possesses. Along with natural resources and vast energetic potential, our greatest chance is our creative, innovative and hard-working people. Investing in knowledge and new technologies is a pre-condition for reaching the European Union standards that we aspire to. Knowledge is an important stimulus in development of the overall economy.
However, we still have to solve some basic development problems. The trade deficit of Bosnia-Herzegovina burdens its economy, so I am glad that this fair presents more and more production possibilities aimed at export. The Vine and Viticulture Equipment Fair is becoming a significant event for a successful promotion of traditional Herzegovina’s products and turning Herzegovina into a recognisable “brand”-BRAND in that area.
In today’s conditions, we need a combination of political breakthrough and aiming at development of good economic relations within development of favourable bilateral relations, which we will organize through a more active acting of the B-H economic diplomacy whose acting we need to turn into economic gains.
In the end of my greeting presentation, I want to thank, once again, the organizers for their invested efforts and express congratulations for organizing this significant event, and to all of you who recognised your economic interest I wish you much business success. With a great pleasure, I pronounce this International Trade Fair “Mostar 2006” open.
Thank you!”"

Rome, March 30-31, 2006
“Mr. President of the European People’s Party,
Presidents and Prime Ministers,
Members of the European Parliament,
It is my pleasure to have an opportunity to address you today at the Congress of the European People’s Party, as a President of the B-H Presidency and the SDA President, which is the biggest party in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I use this opportunity to say a few words about my country – Bosnia-Herzegovina, and SDA, for being its president.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place where we can see the most direct meeting and an intense permeation of the East and the West, different cultures and four world monotheistic religions. For hundreds of years, mostly in peace and tolerance, in our country live Bosniacs-Muslims, Serbs-the Orthodox, and Croats-Catholics, Jews and numerous other national and religious minorities. Only this kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina has perspective. In virtually all B-H cities stand mosques, catholic and orthodox churches, occasional synagogue, side by side for centuries.
A significant progress has been achieved in all domains. We are conducting comprehensive reforms in all areas. We have achieved a political agreement on reviewing the B-H Constitution. This means that our country will have a more functional and efficient structure, but also that it has finally stepped out of the Dayton into the Brussels phase. By the end of the year, we expect to sign the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as to be accepted in the Partnership for peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Now, if you permit me, I would like to say something about the Democratic Action Party. As the strongest political party, SDA has given its considerable contribution to the achieved progress and it is a leading force in conducting reforms. Along with this, SDA continues with the process of internal transformation. Today, it is no longer exclusively a monotheistic party. In its leadership and membership, besides Bosniacs, there are now members of all B-H peoples. Such as is our today’s delegation, which includes Desnica Radivojevic, the B-H Federation Vice-president and the GO SDA Vice-president, and Dr Josip Jurisic, the President of the SDA Commission for International Cooperation and the Mayor of Sarajevo.
SDA has been defined and is becoming a people’s party of political centre, which accepts European values and standards, membership in EU and NATO, along with preservation of traditional values and the Bosnian identity. We stand for civil society and rule of law, and we cherish values of anti-fascism.
We find it crucial to establish the truth about deaths and the character of war in our country, 1992-2995. The role of the Hague Tribunal is very important in that matter, because based only on truth and justice, we can build trust between people, peoples and countries in the region and a better future for new generations.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We need to continue with the historic process of enlarging the European Union. Such Europe will definitely become the oasis of peace, stability and prosperity, where all its citizens, regardless of ethnic, racial, religious and cultural membership, will feel at home and be proud of European unity of differences.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, regardless of the difficulties we are going through, what is always winning is a vision of a modern, united Europe based on equal possibilities and rights for all its citizens. This is the only future, not just for B-H, but for our entire continent, and my party – SDA and I will continue to work on achieving it.
Thank you.”"

The speech of the B-H Presidency Member, Mr. Ivo Miro Jovic at the conference
“Role of the Pan-European Union in integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the European Union”,
Sarajevo, March 24, 2006
“Dear President and
The Presidency,
Your Excellencies,
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Guests,
I thank you for invitation and having pleasure to greet you at today’s conference whose main subject is the role of the Pan-European Union in integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina into European Union. I am extremely glad that the honorary president of the International Pan-European Union, a great European and a friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina, H.E. Otto von Habsburg is here with us today.
Upon his initiative, far back in 1979, an empty chair was placed in the plenary hall of the European Parliament as a European belonging symbol of the Central and Eastern European peoples, who were at the time under the communist regime. This gesture expressed his belief that that part of Europe, and Bosnia-Herzegovina within, would become a full-fledged member of the European Union some day. Your Excellency, we wish to thank you today for that belief and devotion.
After undergoing the catastrophic world wars, the European continent has faced the challenge of uniting Europe. The founder of the Pan-European Union, count Coudenhov-Kalergi (KUDENOV-KALERGI), far back in 1922 in one of his articles called “Pan-Europe – one proposal”, called for a political and economic unity of European countries and this envisaged events that marked the second half of the twentieth century – the creation of European Union.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has always belonged to the European political, cultural and economic space. However, the process of European integration is a process that seeks fundamental changes in society and demands comprehensive adjustment of the political, institutional frame and legal system in order to achieve European standards in all areas, which is our current priority.
The Pan-European Union, in its program exactly points to the fundamental principles demanding Europe as a community of peace, rights and liberty, based on the Christian image of man, without detriment to anybody and in benefit to all.
Europe as a community of peace must enhance friendship of all its peoples and fight against the disuniting of European peoples and deterring national and social conflicts. Only supporting the differences of the European peoples, cultures and traditions as an expression of a rich European heritage, we will be able to build the European patriotism, which supplements the national patriotism.
The legal state principle ensures a universal value of human rights and is a condition for a gradual construction of Europe, because only this provides the European guarantee as a community of values. Unfortunately, exile, refugees and ethnic cleansing in the past war bore massive negative consequences to our country, Bosnia-Herzegovina.
This is why with our choosing Europe, as a community of equal rights to all, we can prevent destiny, which peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina have recently experienced. Besides this, legal state must naturally include the protection of human life from abortion, euthanasia and DNA-manipulation.
Europe, as a community of freedom, must resist every violence and totalitarianism such as were ideologies of communism and nationalism. Free and self-reliable development of man and strengthening family, support the awareness of protection and helping the weak and ill, as well as the responsibility to future generations. Respecting every difference, especially in language and culture, is one of the basic principles Europe is based on. Equality of peoples and citizens is what my country also stands for.
We strive for Europe of free men and peoples, which respects the dignity of every man and shows respect to God and its creation; Europe that supports the ideals of freedom and human rights all around the world; Europe that could be a role model to the entire world as a leading spiritual power.
This is the Europe we want,
This is the Europe that Bosnia-Herzegovina wants to belong to.
Thank you!”"

Mr. President of the European College,
Mr. Mayor,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please allow me to express my pleasure with having this opportunity to address you today, here at the European College, the most prestigious European academic institution of the European studies.
I consider my today’s speech also as lobbying for Bosnia-Herzegovina to enter the European Union, since some of you will soon certainly be among those who will be deciding on our entry in next couple of years, when the time comes.
It has been ten years after the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina had ended and the Dayton Agreement was signed. During those ten years, Bosnia-Herzegovina has come a long way – from a completely destroyed country, ravaged by war, to a country that started the negotiations with the European Union on the Association and Stabilization Agreement couple of months ago, i.e. a country that is determinately going toward the European Union and NATO membership.
How difficult and complex this road was can best be seen by shortly looking back at my country and its society ten years ago, and compare it to how they look today.
Bosnia-Herzegovina, ten years ago, immediately after signing the Dayton Agreement
Cities, settlements, economy, infrastructure, communication, all devastated, damaged or destroyed. Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided by war, entity or other lines of separation. In the field, three conflicted and well-armed armies, with around 500 thousand soldiers and 70 thousand members of the international military forces. Three police departments, which were far from professional and democratic standards.
The State borders were porous. The freedom of movement restricted. Crossing the entity lines regarded as an act of bravery.
The legal system of Bosnia-Herzegovina divided and more connected with neighbouring countries then internally. An intensive presence and interference in the internal affairs by neighbouring countries.
Over 2.2 million (more then half of population) in exile and refugees. Their property destroyed, devastated and usurped. The return was unthinkable, and those who dared to come back were exposing their lives and health to danger. Many were killed or wounded in those attempts.
War criminals at large. The cooperation of a larger number of institutions (RS and so-called Herzeg-Bosnia) with the Hague Tribunal almost nonexistent.
Economic and social situation extremely difficult. Hundreds of thousands of pensioners, disabled veterans, families of shehits and demobilized fighters without proper compensations. Employees with paid salaries were rare.
State institutions almost nonexistent and those that were established did not function. At the same time, entities and other para-institutions were operating as a state in a state. Presence and interference of neighbouring countries in internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina were at all levels and segments of a society and authority.
Bosnia-Herzegovina today, ten years after
Today, ten years after, Bosnia-Herzegovina is unquestionable as a state and there are no serious political forces, inside or outside, that could endanger its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Additional authorities and numerous institutions at the state level have been established.
A significant progress in returns of those in exile and refugees has been achieved. According to UNHCR data, over million (around 50%) of the exiled and refugees have returned. Almost all property has been restored, though often destroyed and devastated. Freedom of movement has been ensured, including securing the returnees. The returnees still have many problems, starting with unemployment, rights to health care, education, pensions, etc.
Besides that, returning means re-establishing the multi-ethnic structure of country, which, at the same time, strengthens the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In the economic field, macro-economic stability has been ensured, with inflation like the one in the European Union. We have the strongest currency in the region. In regard to the post-war period, GDP has been tripled. Foreign exchange reserves have increased 15 times and last year they amounted to 3.3 billion EUR. We regularly paying off our foreign debt that amounts to 2.1 billion EUR. Our banking system has been consolidated. The industrial production is in constant growth. Foreign investments are increasing. We recorded a constant growth in public revenues. VAT has been successfully introduced. According to achieved results, exempting the period of 1992-1995 when the IC, unfortunately, had not reacted adequately, we can state that the post-war period in Bosnia-Herzegovina was a successful project of the International Community – the United Nations, NATO, European Union, etc.
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the path to Europe
Bosnia-Herzegovina has started negotiations with the European Union on signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement several months ago. The beginning of those negotiations represents the most significant political event in our country since signing the Dayton Agreement ten years ago, and it represents a definite transition of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the Dayton to the Brussels phase.
The beginning of the negotiations was preceded by the realization of a number of extremely difficult and complex reforms. Allow me to mention some of them: customs and fiscal system reform, establishment and development of the State Border Service, introduction of VAT, Public Broadcasting System reform, judicial system reform, etc.
We have also conducted a defence system reform. Immediately after signing the Dayton, ten years ago, there were 500.000 armed men in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who belonged to the three mutually conflicted armies. Defence was in the exclusive jurisdiction of an entity, who had its defence ministers and separate armies, mostly of mono-ethnic composition.
Today, after the conducted reform, the issue of defence is explicitly in the jurisdiction of the State! Entities no longer have any jurisdiction in that regard, and the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina has professional, united and multi-ethnic armed forces, organized according to the NATO standards. The Armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina today have 12 thousand soldiers.
Only ten years ago, the world was sending soldiers to our country, to help us in construction of peace and stability. Today, Bosnia-Herzegovina, naturally within its possibilities, is sending its own troops to the International peace missions. Our soldiers and police officers are today in Iraq, Liberia, Sierra Leone and a few more critical areas.
Association with the European Union and the NATO is the main priority of our foreign policy. At the same time, this is also the best way to establish peace and stability permanently, not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in the entire region of the Southeastern Europe.
This is why we are going to do everything possible so that Bosnia-Herzegovina would fulfil the necessary requirements on its path to Europe as soon as possible.
We hope that by the end of this year we will have completed the negotiations and signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement (by the end of the Finnish or at the beginning of the German Chairmanship of the European Union).
We are fully aware of the fact that meeting requirements for entering the European Union is primarily in our country’s and our citizens’ interest, in order to ensure prosperous future for our children and future generations.
It is why we support the EU’s insistence on meeting the set requirements strictly, when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the other candidate countries as well. This especially refers to the request for unconditional cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, i.e. arresting the war criminals still at large.
I’m primarily referring to Karadzic and Mladic, who are, along with Slobodan Milosevic, the personification of crime and death in our region.
The extradition of Karadzic and Mladic to the Hague Tribunal would finally close the war page of our history. It would enable hundreds of thousands of their direct or indirect victims to finally find peace and commit themselves to normal life. Besides this, this will prove that justice may be slow, but attainable as well. Their arrest would surely set loose the new amount of positive energy, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the entire region as well.
How we regard the war crime and war criminals is the most important issue not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but in the entire region as well. It is not enough to arrest Karadzic, Mladic and others indicted by the Hague Tribunal! It is necessary that the local administration of justice processes several hundreds (perhaps even thousands!) of other criminals. However, an awareness of war crimes and a manner of how we treat criminals has gradually started to change. It is inadmissible in today’s Europe, and anywhere in the world for that matter, that war criminals are considered national heroes, and crime is being justified with the so-called ethnic interests! There is no excuse for that!
The recent example of arresting Ante Gotovina in Croatia concretely shows that such approach of the European Union and its strict insistence on meeting requirements is the only correct way that shows results.
In regard to association of Bosnia-Herzegovina with NATO, the adjustment of our armed forces with the standards of the North-Atlantic Alliance is going very well, and we think that B-H has a real chance of joining the group of countries, which will become the full-fledged members in 2008.
The process of meeting the requirements, however, could be going even faster. The problem is in the country’s existing constitutional structure. Today, Bosnia-Herzegovina has a non-functional and expensive political system, a weak State and strong Entities. During the last couple of months, we have been conducting negotiations on changing the constitutional structure. We have come to an agreement about the first phase giving the stronger mandate and the more efficient authority to the State.
Relations with neighbours and Bosnia-Herzegovina in the region
I would also like to say something about our relations with our neighbours and a situation in the region of the Southeastern Europe.
Bosnia-Herzegovina has entirely understood the message from Brussels that the regional cooperation is the key for institutionalisation of relations between countries of our region with the European Union.
Ten years after the end of the war, we have mostly normalised relations with both of our neighbours – Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Unfortunately, we still haven’t signed and verified all the necessary bilateral agreements (borders, property and legal relations).
We have full diplomatic relations with the both countries; we have signed a great deal of bilateral agreements in various domains, including agreements on free commerce. Citizens of our three countries can travel to Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro having just identity cards.
As you can see, a lot has been done. However, I think that there is still a lot more to be done. Parallel with the further agreement regulation of relations, I find that it is necessary to intensify efforts to enhance the infrastructural connection of our three countries. This is especially because a unique infrastructure was being built within one joint country over the last 80 years.
That is why I will propose organizing a three-lateral meeting of our countries, where Heads of State of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro could emphasize the need for initiating the regional infrastructural projects in order to have a better connection between our countries and citizens. I believe that we should even try to set some concrete goals. One of them could be, for example, the reconstruction and modernisation of road and railroad connection of our three Capitals, which could shorten the distance between Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade to less than a four-hour drive.
Our country is actively participating in all regional initiatives, which we find very important, as for returning trust and establishing permanent stability in our region, as well as for concretely preparing our country to enter the European Union.
Besides political cooperation and regular exchange of opinions with other member countries, the regional initiatives have been helping us to intensify our economic relations and to have better relations between our businessmen.
In that sense, I would like to emphasize that Bosnia-Herzegovina supports the recent initiative of the European Commission on establishing the free commerce zone in the area of the western Balkan.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Equality, tolerance and respecting differences are the foundations of the modern democratic world and the values the European Union is based on, but also they are multi-century tradition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a place where four great monotheistic religions have met, bringing to our country and its citizens all the splendour of their cultures and traditions, as one of the rare autochthonous European multi-ethnic societies.
In virtually every B-H city, a Catholic and an Orthodox church, a mosque and somewhere a synagogue, stood side by side for hundreds of years. Our peoples have learned to live together in peace and tolerance, and wars in our country were consequences of the world and (or) regional wars, bigger or minor interventions from neighbouring countries. Such was the case in the period of 1992-1995.
This is why we are very proud of our differences and our multi-ethnicity, which we consider our greatest wealth and comparative advantage.
Among else, it is due to our multi-ethnicity that Bosnia-Herzegovina is one of the rare countries that have good relations with the European Union and USA, as well as with China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I believe that you will agree that my short review of the path that Bosnia-Herzegovina has taken in last ten years, speaks volumes about the great importance of the current moment for my country.
Ten years after the war, Bosnia-Herzegovina has possibility to close one of the hardest chapters in its history definitely, and from an object to become an active subject of the International affairs, which will be apt to contribute constructively to permanent stability and prosperity establishment in the Southeastern Europe.
We, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, are trying everything possible to achieve it. However, we also need your help in order to cross the remaining part of the road to the European Union and NATO as quickly as possible.
Let us not forget that it was the permanent peace and stability establishment in previously completely destroyed and divided Europe, which was the main guiding idea of the fathers of what is the European Union now – Conrad ADENAUER, Jean MONET, Paul SPACK and Robert SCHUMAN.
I am convinced that Bosnia-Herzegovina’s entry in the European Union and NATO will once again show that those visionaries were right.
Thank you."
19330,"H Presidency Sulejman Tihic on Occasion of The Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1st of March), Sarajevo, February 28th",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=19330&langTag=en-US,2006-02-28,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
I wish you welcome and thank you for coming tonight to celebrate with us The Bosnia and Herzegovina Independence Day.
Fourteen years ago, on the referendum that took place on February 29 and March the 1 1992, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared themselves FOR the sovereign and independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, a state of equal peoples and citizens – Bosniacs, Serbs, Croats and all others living in this country.
This decision is a product of the historic and the other circumstances dealing with the dissolution of the former SFRY. Until that very point, Slovenia and Croatia have already declared their independences. Bosnia and Herzegovina then did the same, based on the recommendations of the International Arbitrary Commission for SFRY, which actually confirmed the rights of the SFRY’s former republics citizens to declare their independence.
Soon after that, there came the open aggression against our country, as a result of the greater states ambitions and deals to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina. Along with the aggression, there came our sufferings – about 150 thousand people were killed and the hundreds of thousands were wounded, tents of thousands of women were raped and the hundreds of thousands of BH citizens passed throughout incredible tortures and humiliations in the concentration camps. About 2 million of our citizens were expelled from their homes and displaced throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole world, the hundreds of thousands of houses were destroyed, as well as the infrastructure, and economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Throughout of the whole of its’ history, Bosnia and Herzegovina was never divided and it has never changed its’ name. Bosnia was never a part of the neighboring states, and its’ borders were defined even in the 17th century and have not been changed until today. There is no doubt that Bosnia and Herzegovina is a legacy created during its’ centuries long history but not the product of any kind of deal between the internal or external factors.
Continuity of the BH statehood has been never cut totally and its’ origins go back to the 10th century – The Medieval century and the Kulin ban of Bosnia, Stjepan Tomašević, the last Bosnian king until nowadays. Bosnia has, mostly within the same borders, always been a political and territorial whole, keeping a high-level autonomy same in the Ottoman and Austrian-Hungarian Empire, as well as in the Kingdom and Socialist Yugoslavia later on.
The documents and decisions of the Anti-Nazi Council of the national Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina have confirmed the historic and political continuity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressing that it is not a Serbian, Croatian or a Muslim, but equally a Serbian, a Croatian and a Muslim one. On that basis, we have declared the independence of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the 1992-1995 aggression, the BH patriots resisted these attempts for achieving the greater state nationalistic projects and defended the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is truth that Bosnia and Herzegovina is still not the one our citizens wanted it to be and declared for in 1992. It is still not the country many of our best country fellows gave their life for.
However, Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the right way. It is today not under question as state and there are no serious political force in or out of BH which could dispute its’ territorial integrity and sovereignty. We are moving forward. Our country became the full member of the Council of Europe and I do believe that we will sign the SAA with the EU and become the PfP member. We also expect top be invited to join the NATO in 2008.
We are implementing the overall reforms in administration, taxies, education, security and defense. Besides, we expect to reach the political agreement about the changes of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And this will be the result of the domestic political forces.
Although we are not quite happy yet, the economic trends are increasing. I know that it is not enough and we need to achieve more. This year is giving lot of chances and opportunities. It is also important to reestablish the confidence. And for confidence amongst the peoples it is necessary to find the truth and to please the justice. Only on the basis of truth and justice we can built a prosperous future and better relations between the peoples and states.
In spite of all problems, I am convinced that the forces of hatred and division are defeated so our peoples and citizens are more and more accepting Bosnia and Herzegovina as their only homeland.
With such the wish, I congratulate the Independence Day to the BH citizens home and abroad.
Thank you."
17676,Address by the Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Ivo Miro Jovic at the ceremony of the 60th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) in Rome,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=17676&langTag=en-US,2005-10-17,"Mr. Director General,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,
It is my privilege to attend the Ceremony on the occasion of the 60th Anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Allow me, on behalf of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and my own, to extend sincere congratulations and best wishes for the prosperous future of the Organization. At the outset, I would also like to congratulate to H.E. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, on the FAO Agricola Medal award.
One month ago, I had another great privilege: to attend the High Level Plenary Meeting of the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. I was honored and humbled to be amongst 180 world leaders who adopted the Final Document that will set the course of the World for the next decade. Needless to say, major part of the Document was dedicated to the Millennium Development Goals and to the strategy for their accomplishment. Having determined that the Organization of the United Nations had approached the fork on its path, the pivotal moment in its existence, we decided to take the turn that will hopefully lead us to the future with less hunger, less poverty, less fear and grievances, more freedom, more stability and economic prosperity and more justice for all.
Just to remind you: in the Final Document we emphasized the responsibility of each and every country for its own development. Good governance, transparency, sound policies, mobilizing internal resources, attracting international flows, promoting international trade and tightening financial discipline is what each Government owes not only to its own people, but to the international community as well. For governments that cannot feed their own populations or create conditions for production of sufficient food supplies could only become a source of instability and lead their countries into all sorts of conflicts.
Fight against hunger and poverty can not be overemphasized. Rural and agricultural development play important role in that fight and Final Document stressed that role. In it, we reaffirmed that food security and rural and agricultural development must be urgently addressed in the context of national development and response strategies. We expressed our conviction that eradication of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, particularly as they affect children, is crucial for the achievement of the MDGs. Rural and agricultural development, says Paragraph 46. of the Final Document, should be an integral part of national and international development policies. We deemed it necessary to increase productive investment in rural and agricultural development to achieve food security. And we committed ourselves to increasing support for agricultural development and trade capacity building in the agricultural sector in development countries. It is decided that support for commodity development projects, especially market based projects should be encouraged.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a relatively small country, the IC still deem us “post conflict society” and our economy is still heavily dependent on agriculture. Problems that we encounter in that area are many-fold. Systemic: until recently we did not even have one economic space in the country and we still do not have the Ministry for Agriculture on the state level; Economic: due to the opening of our market to the Free Market Economy, which was a precondition for our membership in the Euro-Atlantic integrations that we strive for, we are flooded with agricultural products from the countries with heavily subsidized agricultural production. Hence, we suffer a heavy deficit in our trade, since the agricultural products make two thirds of our overall trade. It will get worse before it gets any better, tells us the experience of other European countries in transition. And our farmers are still getting killed and mutilated by landmines left behind from the recent war we were involved in. One would bitterly say: we reap what we sow.
On a brighter side: Bosnia and Herzegovina is a proud member of FAO, we timely pay our contributions and we benefited from the membership a great deal. To mention but a few, we participated in the Project for prevention of corn pests in Central and Eastern Europe, total value of 2,260.000 US$, “Inventory of agricultural resources in Bosnia and Herzegovina”, financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy, implemented by FAO, fish farms in Bosanska Krupa, assisted by Government of Norway in cooperation with FAO, regional program “Quality of Food in South East Europe”, total value of 386.000 US$ etc. Our food and agricultural experts benefited enormously from the training courses and programs organized by FAO over the past decade. We are also looking forward to reopening of the FAO office in Bosnia and Herzegovina that was closed in 2000. We remain committed to further strengthen our cooperation with FAO in all its fields and aspects.
Allow me to conclude by reiterating the importance we attach to the FAO, our gratitude for the assistance we received in the past and our best wishes for the future of the organization that has become, in the past 60 years, irreplaceable in its role of a fighter against hunger and poverty, the two major menaces of today’s World.
Thank you Mr. Director General"
17485,Address by the Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina H. E. Mr. Ivo Miro Jovic Summit of Heads of Central European States Zagreb 13 - 15 October 2005,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=17485&langTag=en-US,2005-10-14,"Dear Presidents,
Excellencies, distinguished friends,
It is a great pleasure for me, as a chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to greet you here and to, first of all, express my gratitude to our host for the effort made in organizing this meeting. The moment in which this meeting takes place has a historic meaning for Republic of Croatia. I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate President Mesić, Prime Minister Sanader and to the Government of the Republic of Croatia, as well as to all its citizens, on this outstanding accomplishment. Opening of negotiations for the EU membership is a big step and it will represent a motivating factor for the countries still making efforts to achieve such a status. This time, EU reconfirmed its indubitable openness and has shown how committed it is to enlarge the EU family, thus offering us a great encouragement.
Countries participating at this gathering are facing different challenges.
These differences derive from their very status within the EU. Fortunately, some of the countries participating in this event are the full EU members. Bosnia and Herzegovina expects that their support, we enjoyed so far, will continue. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have put special efforts in implementing reforms in all of the segments of our society – a precondition for the opening of negotiations on the Stabilization and Association Agreement. Unfortunately, reforms in our country are not always synhronized with the principles and standards that are applied in Europe, but the reform solutions, with the aim of democratization, offer to us non-democratic, unjust and unfair solution, and always at cost of one people the one smallest in number, Croats. Signing of this agreement will be a key moment for all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The advantages that this agreement brings will be impetus for the further economic development with increase of foreign investments. We expect the political dialogue to continue and we expect to gradually start the process of harmonization of our own with the EU legislation, as well as the improvement of the economic cooperation and the gradual development of the free trade zone.
While giving the general evaluation of the success of the ongoing reforms, I would like to mention the difficulties and problems we are facing during that process. At present, I would like to point out the success that Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved by adopting the laws unifying the defence system and indications of a completed negotiations on police reforms. That gives hope and I excpect a policy that will stop controling crisis and solve it.
In December this year, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the unjust Dayton/Paris Agreement. It will be an opportunity for all of us in Bosnia and Herzegovina to review what has been done so far, where we are standing right now, and what is yet to be achieved. The experience gained in these ten years shows, without a doubt, that there is a need to find ways and modalities on how to change Dayton/Paris Agreement.
The solution offered in DPA has defined a nonfunctional state structure. Europe will not welcome such a structure, one state, two enteties and three peoples. With the given Constitution, that has not been translated yet in any of the languages of our peoples, Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks (perhaps it is easier to manipulate with it, like this), and with the Sovereign, called the High Representative, we are not respected country in EU, even though others are trying to present it differently. That is a huge challenge that the political leaders and peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina are facing. By developing the state institutions, harmonizing them, first of all, with the European standards and by overtaking the responsibility for development and future we will ensure the preconditions for the full respect of human rights in all of the society’s segments.
Respect for diversity and especially, for differences in languages and culture is one of the principles that the Europe rests on. We are committed to equal rights for all the peoples and citizens in our country, and that is something that we are often being denied of. Understanding of the democratic values and the value of cultural diversity are the foundations for the promotion of tolerance and cooperation in Europe. The Croatian people, as the smallest in number in B-H, are deprived of the rights that are even guaranted to minorities in EU, such as the education curriculum and the right to have Televison and radio program in Croatian language.
Co-operation among the countries participating at this meeting in all the aspects is of exceptional importance, and has to be intensified even further. It has to be especially efficient in battling the global terrorism – a key task that the entire world community is faced with.
We are aware of how important is the accession to the European Union. Taking into consideration clearly defined conditions set out for the future members, we are aware of how complex and delicate political project this is, as the fullfilment of respect of EU principles and standards are primarily necessary."
17547,H Presidency Ivo Miro Jovic at the 33rd General Conference of UNESCO,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=17547&langTag=en-US,2005-10-10,"Mr. President of the UNESCO General Assembly, Mr. General Director, Mr. President of the Executive council, ladies and gentlemen ministers, ladies and gentlemen,
This year UNESCO celebrates its 60th anniversary. To all of you I would like to congratulate this for us such important anniversary. This intellectual body of the UN, as some call it, during these 60 years has reached its full maturity and fulfilled the expectations of all countries members among them Bosnia and Herzegovina as a proud member. It has fulfilled expectations set long time ago, in 1945 when the world just deserted its tragic history, decided to form its moral nucleus, and form a place where the communication and dialog of diversity will replace language of violence. UNESCO has for years matured and searched for the models by which would help to young states and peoples whose cultures were endangered and languages faced disappearance, in order to replace the power of force by the power of arguments and to give the hope to those peoples that they are not alone in their searches.
By its mission of introducing literacy and making the education possible to the poorest, UNESCO has given the hope that the light even being so frail wins over the darkness of deprivation. Today in the world of information technology, when communication seems so easy to reach and the languages of big nations so well known, it is hard to imagine that someone feels ununderstood and frustrated. No wonder, when that knowledge and love is often just a one sided wish for cognition and understanding of the other and different, which disappears the moment the same message is not reciprocated. Relations of respect towards the culture in which one is borne, by which is fed and in which his ethical path got his guidelines, should be first of all respect.
The messages are sometimes lost in translation, and the communication between big and small languages is reduced to functioning of the telephone lines, as a Croat from Bosnia and Herzegovina well known Nobel prize winner Ivo Andrić, said it figuratively. “While I was a diplomat, I used to phone my mother from a large world centers to a small place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, she would hear my words well, but because of poor telephone lines I could not understand her at all.”
I believe that the next Convention on cultural differences, that will be a guaranty to small nations, their languages and cultures, that will be a mean by which those lines of communications will improve and never again small nations will be ununderstood. As in order to be open to the others in this world, which has no borders one has to be sure in his own identity. That identity is a prerequisite of cultural identity and is as important to people as to persons. On the contrary, denial of anybodies identity and difference leads to violence. This Convention is a precondition and confirmation of the basic human right. Defending the cultural difference and the difference of identities we raise our voices to defend universal values. Giving the right to every people to their own language in media and the education of their children as the future foundation of a healthy society in their mothers tongue in which they hear their first gentle words in their homes, we acknowledge to the person and the people right to the cultural identity, we are setting foundations to a more human society, to which my country is committed in its path to the EU membership, to which will, with its cultures, languages and historic heritage, contribute in building of one common European identity, that will be proud of its richness and multi-layerness.
Not like as it was until now, making it impossible for one people (Croatian) to have radio and TV channel, own curriculum in schools in own language, an to give that right to other two people, Bosniacs and Serbs. And interpreting it all like EU standard and principle.
The world today faces the risk of uniformisation and fears which that uniformisation imposes. The lack of money and economic unjustifiableness cannot be an excuse that children are not allowed to right to be educated in language of their parents. That is frequently used as an argument of imposing uniform education in our country. Unfortunately, during the last few years issues regarding the reforms of education are being subject of consideration of many to whom that is not a primary mission, but UNESCO-s.
After the war until 2003, UNESCO gave the best fruits in teacher training and reconstruction of primary and secondary school, and training of experts in ministries of education. We would like you to get actively involved in the most sensitive area that considers the foundations of a healthy society, in order to avoid any feelings of neglect and denial of rights to education in mother tongue.
Let us remember Holy Father Paul II, that peace envoy, who said the most beautiful words that each people exist because of its culture and for its culture. The culture has created feeling of belongingness to a community among people and because of it each community owns history that overcomes history of person that builds that community. With his own life the Pope was a witness of a history of a country that knows what owes to its culture. Without that culture defended so frantically, His country would not survive totalitarian regime through which has passed. And it would not be able to refer to its old history.
Without the culture which is strongly defended and kept in families through churches and religious communities, the cultural values in my countries would not have memories of rich historic and cultural, traditional and language heritage of our peoples. My country has unfortunately experienced a war in which the cultural differences because of its lack of knowledge were sometimes opposed to each other.
The consequence of war was that each culture and people in general chaos was searching for a shelter in well know and familiar. Just like in any trouble one looks for a shelter in own home, which has given him the security. Denial of history and culture has just intensified conflict facing the fear of repeated uniformization and replacement of one force by the other.
50 years of denial of the history and culture of small peoples that constituted former state of SFRJ, created myths prejudices and history that was not thought at school, as it was denied there, and some primeval fears have given up their place to dialogue and tolerance.
UNESCO has helped a lot in organizing Presidential regional forums from Ohrid to the last in Varna, where the regional heads of states have adopted common declaration about the dialogue between the cultures, peoples and religions as well as valuing the regional cultural heritage.
We firmly believe, that the denial of the personal and collective identity is part of the past and that will never again someone’s identity be denied and that the culture, language and history of each people will be studied at schools, in right manner without threatening the other and different, and that we will be close to each other by it. The history that is often written in centers far from our homes and by selective use of information was as well the cause of long-lasting frustrations. The truth remains saved in testimonies of people that are real witnesses of the times they live.
The history that does not take in consideration all truths and facts is a cause of conflict that are born from the frustrations and from impossibility to articulate own truth. The regional history was for many years a subject of discussions, often created on long-lasting prejudices because of the other and different and selective use of information, all familiar to single-party regimes that are based on one truth.
In all that chaos UNESCO was an avant-garde that instead of mere diplomacy and investigating missions, of which B&H has seen an infinite number, has sent the envoys of peace foundation building. One of those envoys UNESCO has sent in the middle of war to the first mission to Sarajevo and Mostar destroyed by war. Mr. Bouchanki was the first peace envoy with the first idea of reconstructing the destroyed Old Bridge in Mostar as a symbol of reconciliation of then warring peoples in Mostar.
From the symbol of war and division, by building the Old bridge, UNESCO has invited the most famous experts for the restauration, World bank and EBRD with the donations of governments members of UNESCO among which are Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Croatia and Hungary, the restoration of the Old bridge has started the restoration of trust in a multiethnic town, which from the most beautiful city in the country has became a favorite place of war reporters. Day after day, stone after stone dignified history was coming back and the place of common memories and reconciliations was restored.
Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs again today proud of their Bridge. UNESCO gave them back that pride, UNESCO created a place of unity and true dialog. The old bridge is material proof that the language of dialogue can replace the language of dispute. The Old Bridge is today a meeting place of tourists from all over the world, as it has always been. That is the meeting place of young people of Mostar, which by the cold river Neretva during the hot summer days enjoy as the generations before them did.
Cultural tourists replaced war tourists and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Mostar are grateful to you for that. The restored Old Bridge and the old nucleus of Mostar are just the same a meeting place of the world experts for restorations and reconstruction who come to learn and admire the skills transferred to today’s masters by experience of their ancestors in identical renovation of monuments. Mostar will, I hope, become a place from which the other places in the region will draw experience of renovation and healing up of wounds made by conflict. For Bosnia and Herzegovina this is the start on healthy foundations. Recognition of its first monument opened the door to an extraordinary discussion, where each municipality and each community compete in emphasizing and valuing own monuments, which were unknown only yesterday to the wider public. Wonderful example is Blidinje lake on Čvrsnica Mountain, and Hutovo Blato as parks of nature and urban antiquity Travnik and Jajce.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is one virgin territory full of unexplored layers of history where each layer and foundation hides one another foundation just like peoples that live there. That is the country nucleus of identity and history that knew many dynasties and conquerors, all big European and Asian cultures, religions and civilizations. Their remains are visible in kings town of Jajce, and in well preserved custom of tattooing that can be seen on old women hands in Tomislavgrad and in Bobovac in their custom of wearing black as a symbol of bereavement after the last medieval Queen Katarina, who has found her refuge in Vatikan, where is her tomb, in picturesque houses built in ottoman style as remembrance on ottoman rule architecture that was preserved for centuries and in most beautiful gardens of the capitals in Austrian-Hungarian harmony built during the Austrian-Hungarian rule in our country and in Byzantine temples of Greek Orthodox churches that are ornaments to the cities next to ottoman minarets and catholic churches. Jewish synagogues are remembrance of Jews that found their refuge during their hundreds years of migrations. But the most beautiful of all that our country poses are the bridges as they connect people and river banks, peoples and cultures and we are continuing to build them with a good spirit of UNESCO. Our history is visible in buildings, country and people, in languages, dialects and living myths. In a way they talk and behave the different cultural codes are mixed as their ancestors lived through them, in the chests with national costumes that are on the first sight all so similar and only to them so different.
In songs and stories that are transferred from kin to kin, in the way they keep their tradition, and in the way they meet their neighbors for religious holidays, when they with pride present that difference. I would like to invite UNESCO to carry on with its noble mission, so that Bosnia and Herzegovina become an example of application of the Convention on cultural difference, where conditions will be formed for everyone to be proud and to all guaranty will be given that his language, tradition, historic heritage and culture will be safeguarded so that uniformisation of identity and culture is not allowed
at the expense of the history and tradition. From my side I can promise that we will know how to show the world by our own example that the other and different, language, people, culture and religion can be a bridge that connects. The world in the future will need an example from which can learn. You have that example just two hours away from Paris. Come to learn from us and help us to be an example of coexistence and respect among the cultures and religions. As the insecure world that we witness today is so desperate for such examples.
Thank you."
17251,60th General Assembly High Level Plenary Meeting; Statement by H.E. Ivo Miro Jovic Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=17251&langTag=en-US,2005-09-16,"Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary General,
Majesties, Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,
Allow me at the outset to express my gratitude and
appreciation to H.E Kofi Annan, to High-level Panel on Threats,
Challenges and Changes who provided us with the most
comprehensive document as a backbone of our discussions and
deliberations; to the President of the 59. General Assembly,
H.E. Mr. Jean Ping, who made outstanding effort in
coordinating the Open ended working group and preparing the
draft outcome document for consideration of this impressive
gathering of the world's leaders. I would also like to use this
opportunity to convey the assurances of all the peoples of
Bosnia and Herzegovina of their support for the United Nations,
and their preparedness to undertake their fair share of
obligations and tasks in order to reinvigorate the Organization
in the pivotal moment of its existence.
Mr. President,
Back in the early sixties, at the peak of the Cold War during the
Cuban Crisis, there was a discussion around a dinner table
amongst the Ambassadors accredited to the United Nations
here in New York. As the discussion got heated up over how
soon the world will face its imminent destruction and
disappearance, and the diplomats agreed that we were doomed
to perish but continued arguing who was to be blamed, a quiet
gentleman at the far end of the table raised his hand to get the
attention of his peers. ""Sincerely, my dear friends,"" he said, ""I
fail to understand what the real cause of your argument is,
when all this will be recorded in history as a mere fifty years of
turmoil.""
Well, he was fortunately right, and those fifty years of turmoil
are behind us, as well as the Cold War, the silly armament race,
the imminent threat of nuclear catast rophe and the divided
world as we use to know it. Today, we are facing the new fifty
years of challenges and threats, and we are determined to do
something about it. In the meantime, our Organization has
grown three times in size, the colonialism got transferred to
2
the history books, the bricks from Berlin Wall have become
collectioner's items, and Brazil still rules the soccer field. The
world has become a better place.
Or has it?
The rich are getting richer and the poor are still poor. We had
the same number of inter-state wars in nineties as we had in
the fifties. Instead of tuberculosis we got ourselves the retroviruses
and chicken flue. Some women still cannot vote, and a
lot of children still do not go to school. I wish that the list of
problems we are dealing with is exhausted at the number .159.
of the Draft outcome report. But it is not.
Mr. President,
I come to you from a small, but brave and proud country. It is
among those that comprise almost half of the UN membership,
those under 5 million citizens. And one of those with under
1.500 US$ of GNP per capita. We are referred to as a ""postconflict
society"", we are still dressing the wounds from the
tragic war, we are still chasing the war criminals, and we are
still desperately seeking mutual forgiveness and reconciliation.
This year we will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the
Dayton Peace Accord, the agreement that indeed ended the
war, but failed to provide the foundations for sustainable
peace. The sound foundation of a lasting peace provides for the
equality of all the nations and citizens, and that is not what we
have now. One State, two entities and three nations is a nonfunctional
structure bequeathed to us by Dayton, so we
decided, through negotiations and consensus of all three
constituent nations, to change it for the better, and to adjust it
to our needs and wants.
Despite the complexity of our political and constitutional
structure, we are committed to improve, by consensus, the
constitution that was given to us as a gift, and to take the
ownership of the State from the Office of the High
Representative. We are committed to ensure to our citizens the
highest standards of human and civil rights based on the
European Convention, including the right of Croats, Bosniaks
and Serbs, as three constituent nations, to be informed and
educated in their native languages. Thus we intend to meet our
3
international obligations enshrined in the Millennium
Development Goals: stability, prosperity, good governance,
transparency and fulfillment of our international legal
obligations. We rightly believe that we belong to the European
family of nations, and even though we sometimes get
neglected, we feel that we ought to become a factor of stability
in the region of Balkans.
I am proud to inform you that our Foreign Minister has just
signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Prior
to coming here, the State Presidency that I am a Chairman of
has given the authority to our Permanent Representative here
in New York to sign the International Convention for the
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and the House of
Representatives of the State Parliament approved the
ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We
regularly and timely pay our dues to the UN and affiliated
organizations, and we have our peacekeepers in Haiti, Ethiopia
and Eritrea, Cyprus, Liberia and DR of the Congo.
As far as the UN reform is concerned, Bosnia and Herzegovina
follows closely all the recent developments, we have regular
consultations with our neighbors, countries from the region
and the Eastern European Regional Group. We are committed
to support any and all solutions that stand a chance to get the
consensus from the majority of the member countries. That
goes for the Peace Building Committee, Human Rights Council
and the enlargement of the Security Council. Respecting
unreservedly the UN Charter, we support the principle that any
decision by the UN or its bodies that affects or in any way limits
the sovereignty of a member state, needs to be made
unanimously or by a consensus. We share the view of our
fellow developing countries that we need better representation
at the Security Council, but it would be a pity and the whole
reform process will lose its momentum if we exhaust ourselves
deliberating pros and contras of the Model A and Model B. The
bottom line is that we need a stronger, more efficient, better
financed, more agile, more alert Organization to address the
threats to the international peace and security of a XXI
Century.
We stand ready to take on our shoulders a fair share of that
load."
16441,A speech of the Chairman of the Presidency Borislav Paravac at the send,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=16441&langTag=en-US,2005-06-01,"Excellencies,
Distinguished Officers and Soldiers,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
This ceremony is undoubtedly representing an important date and historic moment for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the year celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the signing the Dayton - Paris Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina, I am honored of taking the opportunity to emphasize that the ever lasting and sustainable peace has been achieved in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the greatest success and legacy in the implementation of the Peace Agreement.
It is a great pleasure to underline the present reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina articulated in its political maturity and capability to actively contribute to the peace keeping and support missions throughout the world, under the patronage of the United Nations Organization.
Up to now Bosnia and Herzegovina has been mostly sending to the peace keeping operations military and police monitoring missions, but with this Unit from the Armed Force of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a new phase in building our foreign policy was opened manifested in our readiness to fulfill our internationally taken obligations towards the significant achievements to the Euro-Atlantic integration.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has made a progress with the improving results in the foreign policy, primarily in the implementation of the main structural reforms in all aspects of our living and in particular in the defense and security sector.
The Unit for destruction of unexploded mine objects from the Armed Force of Bosnia and Herzegovina is going today to the very responsible and trustworthy military mission with the basic goal to help the Iraq people in the reconstruction of their country thus creating secure and safety living environment, creditably representing capabilities of our armed forces and reputation of our country in the world.
I would like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude to all our defense structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina, international organizations in BiH, and especially to the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, which has put a great effort in the training and equipping of this Unit for the very mission.
Dear Soldiers and Officers of this Unit,
Your decision to contribute to this Mission showing your personal courage, professional approach and skill for the most complex tasks, together with the high level of responsibility and patriotism.
On behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina I wish you to successfully carry out your duties within the framework of the mission, and to return healthy and enriched with the new knowledge and experience to your dearly loved ones, your families and to successfully continue your professional careers in the Armed Force of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
16206,"Speech by H.E. Borislav Paravac, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Regional Forum of the Heads of State and Government of South East Europe ""Cultural Corridors of South East Europe",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=16206&langTag=en-US,2005-05-21,"Mr. President of the Republic of Bulgaria,
Honorable Presidents,
Mr. Director General of UNESCO,
Mr. Secretary General of the Council of Europe,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me, at the very beginning to thank our host the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, Mr. Georgi Parvanov, for the warm hospitality and excellent organization of this Forum.
Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the organization of this meeting and I understand it as a continuation of the process of dialogue at the highest level of the South East European countries, to improving our relationships in the field of culture and cultural heritage, started under the auspices of UNESCO in 2003 in Ohrid.
Our specific geographic location, on the crossroads between the East and the West, Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as very rich and boisterous history of our region made this region of South East Europe to become a true mosaic of varieties of religions, cultures, traditions and languages.
Therefore, we fully share UNESCO′s views that the very sphere of culture offered a great potentials for establishing closely cooperation in the South East Europe Region.
We believe that the further joint affirmation and promotion of our rich cultural heritage constitutes one of the best and the most efficient ways to changing the image the world had about our region.
Apart from crucial cultural and historic values, our cultural wealth characterize an important foundation for sustainable economic development. I would like to reiterate that there are 54 cultural monuments enlisted as the world cultural heritage of UNESCO. We do hope it will be 55 after forthcoming meeting of the World Committee for cultural heritage in Durban, South Africa, when the decision on enlisting of the ancient core of the City of Mostar in the world cultural heritage is supposed to be done. It would be the first monument in Bosnia and Herzegovina enlisted in the world heritage with universal value and symbolic of the mixture of diverse cultures and civilizations that have been passing through Bosnia and Herzegovina for ages thus leaving invaluable signs. The Old Bridge during its reconstruction done under the auspices and closely monitored by the UNESCO experts has drawn the attention of the world public with every stone symbolizing the strengthening of the broken links amongst people and regaining mutual trust. From the very beginning as well as the spectacular opening ceremony it represented the most prominent global event recognized in the UNESCO and Ohrid Declaration, as the multi ethnic project of reconciliation and dialogue amongst different religions and cultures. There is nothing more wonderful and more symbolic to show a real dialogue than it is the bridge, which only together with the reconstruction of the Congregation Church, by which Mostar was recognizable, unfortunately destroyed down to the ground, can express its complete real meaning, and therefore thoroughly enrich our cultural heritage.
I would like to take this opportunity to once again welcome the most recent organization of the Donor′s Conference for reconstruction and preservation of the cultural monuments in Kosovo, organized by UNESCO in cooperation with the Council of Europe, European Union Commission and the United Nations Mission.
We are convinced that the reconstruction and preservation of the monuments represent one of the very important steps towards the establishing of the dialogue and long-lasting stability in Kosovo.
Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions are just reviewing the forms and the ways Bosnia and Herzegovina could be included into the great project of the international community. We believe of possessing know-how based on our experience in reconstructing a great number of destroyed cultural monuments in our country. I would especially like to emphasize the great endeavor of the rehabilitation of the Old Bridge in Mostar, which could represent an archetypal for realization of the reconstruction of the most important cultural heritage in Kosovo.
In that context Bosnia and Herzegovina is ready in close cooperation with UNESCO to organize special seminars for training and exercise in our country for the experts from Kosovo, thus contributing the implementation of the assured donor resources.
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
That new period is to be noticeable by the affirmation of the opulence cultural heritage of the South East Europe, that has throughout its history given substantial contribution to the European cultural identity.
Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly support intensifying the cultural cooperation between our countries recognizing the contribution of a network of cultural corridors and cultural rotes could considerably contribute to that goal.
Therefore we support the initiative to setting up Regional Expert Network granting a mandate to develop the Strategy for the identification, protection and promotion of cultural corridors.
By establishing of the cultural corridors, together with affirmation and joint promotion of our cultural heritage we can create our region of the South East Europe again as the region which is going to attract, with its cultural lavishness and diversities, the visitors from all over the world, thus opening new developing perspective of our country.
In that way we convey a strong political message on our willingness to constructively involve our countries into all international processes and our commitment for the region of South East Europe to turn out to be an example of the good neighborly relationships and cooperation based on the regular dialogue and valuable cultural diversities.
Thank you!"
16220,"Speech by H.E. Borislav Paravac, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 3rd Summit of the Council of Europe Heads of Member State and Government in Warsaw, 16",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=16220&langTag=en-US,2005-05-17,"Mr Chairman,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to thank the President and the Government of Poland for their hospitality and excellent organisation of this third Summit, for their initiative in bringing us together, in the historic city of Warsaw and affording us this opportunity to plan for the future of the Council of Europe.
We gathered here in times when the picture of Europe is changing, enlargement of the European Union is redrawing it, and our task is to reassert the Council of Europe’s role as guardian of the fundamental values common to the whole continent. I see it as a victory over the division of Europe, the opportunity to create a continent of shared, common conceptions of rights and values. Council of Europe is indeed the place we all consider our home, our family, responsible to watch over the preservation of our values, a true guardian of modern European civilisation.
***
The Warsaw Summit, is bringing together 46 countries of Europe, a family that was growing bigger on the fast track during two last decades. United under one roof, we are responsible to build the inside of the house with enough place for everyone.
Fundamental values are built in the foundation of our house and we share common sincere commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law, social cohesion, education and culture, as well as protecting and promoting long-term success, stability and overall prosperity of all Europeans.
As you know my country has become the member of this family only three years ago. Council of Europe remains the most important co-operation organisation on the European scene for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On our path to achieving European standards and implement norms and conventions, CoE assisted to Bosnia and Herzegovina to promote a model of democratic culture, actively involving civil society and citizens and to combat all forms of exclusion and discrimination.
The importance we attach to our accession to the Council of Europe is proved by fulfilling of our post-accession commitments, showing that we are on a good track in respect to reaching the European standards of democratic societies and our further integration in Europe. There has been a strong political will and full determination of all political subjects in Bosnia and Herzegovina to embrace the highest democratic values, and on that path we were supported by this organisation and its considerable constructive contribution to the process.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as other countries that still remain outside the Union, needs the CoE to upgrade its democracy and develop a self-sustainable society, rule of law and respect for human rights, in years to come, at the level needed for the membership in the Union. This means promoting the observance of human rights, producing legal instruments and encouraging intergovernmental cooperation, in order to help establishing and maintaining the stability of our Continent, the hope of enduring peace and the well-being of our citizens.
We expect the third Summit to provide the answer in which direction this organisation should go in the future having in mind the challenges we are facing.
I believe, Mr President, that Bosnia and Herzegovina is the example of the society based on the shared values. Its cultural diversity, melting pot of different religions, cultures, traditions, languages, dialects, folklores, architecture, historic heritage, natural resources, persevered throughout centuries, have been endangered during the years of dissolution of Yugoslavia. It is rightly said, building inclusive, stable, and peaceful societies based on shared values means that these values need to be reborn in the minds and hearts of every generation. That is what we are doing in Bosnia and Herzegovina right now, and with a welcomed assistance of our organisation.
Experience of the Western Balkans countries shows how too often were we told that our youngsters and young professionals have so many abilities and so few, or no at all opportunities. This is our historic chance to correct this injustice. To achieve real unity of our continent we should provide environment of equal opportunities for everyone. Every one of our 800 million fellow Europeans should have the same opportunities. Council of Europe is the place to be educated, and phenomena like extreme nationalism and xenophobia come from ignorance. We should let young people travel and learn from meeting each other and enriching their knowledge and experience.
The main challenges have important educational and cultural dimensions. The understanding of democratic values and the value of cultural diversity are fundamental elements in the promotion of peaceful co-existence and co-operation in Europe To strengthen the European identity we have to enhance our cooperation in the sphere of culture, education and intercultural dialogue, and that is the only way to successfully combat intolerance, xenophobia and signs of racism. We must teach our children that our diversity, our common and our individual cultural heritage are a gift to us all. That is the least we have to do.
***
What we are witnessing here today is the beginning of the century of a new, united Europe, undivided and united in its commitment to democracy and respect for human rights, Europe united in pledging a better future for its citizens, and making respect for human rights an integrated part of the daily lives of people living in Europe.
We believe that this Summit should reiterate the role of the CoE as a true Pan-European body which can create a framework for initiatives of our common interest and make the concrete steps in the fight against international terrorism, corruption and organised crime, and in combating trafficking in human beings. We all want to better the world today to provide our children with a healthy basis to develop stability and prosperity and promote European values beyond the borders of this continent. That is what we owe to our children, but to the founders of this organisation as well.
The fight against the corruption and organised crime is the field in which we still need the assistance from the international bodies, and especially through more efficient regional cooperation. In this regard we warmly welcome PACO and CARDS programmes aimed at strengthening of our own capabilities to fight corruption and organised crime.
Bosnia and Herzegovina therefore endorses the three conventions concerning the prevention of terrorism, actions against the trafficking in human beings as well as money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Mr President, Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the proposed Action Plan for this Summit and will actively cooperate in its implementation, as well as we endorse all parts of the draft Declaration. We do so in the firm belief that the Council of Europe is and will continue to be indispensable to the peoples of Europe as the guardian of stability, democratic security and respect of human rights.
***
We are aware that the region of major attention for the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is the Western Balkans. We appreciate their last decision in regard with the Monitoring reports on the compliance of post-accession obligations and cooperation programmes, which from now on are going to be issued twice a year. This represents a clear positive message from Strasbourg to Brussels, and we all know that the road to Brussels goes exclusively through Strasbourg.
We understand that full and unconditional cooperation with the ICTY remains an important task and obligation for the states in the region, and we continue with our efforts in proving our cooperation is full and sincere. This is a visible sign of our progress towards European Union structures and the all-European family of nations.
In the end, Mr President, let me conclude with expressing my firm belief that Europe should establish its unity exactly in our diversity, and that Europe should gather its wealth to produce well-being for all.
We must go beyond all narrow bounds and look forward to the exciting decades of our common prosperity in this century of the united Europe.
Thank you."

Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to participate today at this Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South-East European Cooperation Process. First of all, let me be allowed to express my sincere gratitude to our host – Romania and personally to H.E. Traian Basescu, the President of Romania for a warm welcome and extraordinary organized event of the Eight Summit of the South-East European Cooperation Process.
Mr. Chairman,
Today′s Agenda is addressing the issues of the great importance for the general situation and the future of our countries in the region. Therefore this is yet another occasion to continue our practice of open exchange of our views and prospects regarding activities focused on further development of good neighboring relationship and the region as a whole.
Speaking in terms of the South-East Europe we must always keep in mind the challenges we may be facing on our road. Positive trends within the region have led to the stability and security that until recently had been the key issues in all negotiations on the South-East Europe have finally been replaced with the issues of development and European integration of our countries. With a sincere pleasure I can say that our daily experiences have confirmed a good will of our countries in the region to strengthen the good neighboring relationships, stability and cooperation. Dialogue and understanding have no alternative thus representing the only way to discussing the issues of mutual interests.
Nevertheless, the encouragement to the all regional efforts lies in the perspective of European integration. The countries of the region can be recognized for their continuous democratic reforms aimed to meet European standards. I believe we will all agree with the evaluation that there has been a true progress in the very context. Our countries are now much closer to Europe than they were just a year ago.
On this occasion I would like to emphasize that rapid European integration of our countries implies stable, democratic and progressive South-East Europe. Keeping in mind that these processes are very complex and ever-lasting, we need joint efforts and efficient cooperation in order to achieve the initiated activities. Permanent strengthening of bilateral relationships has a very important role to be a pillar for all regional efforts, mutual communication, intensive and friendly in all areas of mutual interests. It is a basic precondition for accomplishing many goals.
Dear Friends,
We have a specific task, and that is to promote the progress of our countries in the region based on solidarity and mutual affirmation. We, in Bosnia and Herzegovina are truly satisfied with the ways in which the process of cooperation in South-East Europe is being developed and getting larger importance. In that regard it is very important to keep a mature political dialogue that we held in SEECP on the occasion of negotiating many delicate issues. No less important is how to extend our cooperation and addressing the points of specific importance for all participating countries in the process. Allow me to express my sincere congratulations to our hosts for their very successful chairmanship during the last year. We have a high regard for valuable progress achieved in the implementation of the Charter on good neighboring relationships, further improvement of the SEECP and introducing diverse joint activities. New approach to the issues of permanent importance made it possible for us to transfer political support into operational one. There has been visible progress in the countries of the region in the fields of joint actions against organized crime and corruption, creation of energy supply community of South-East Europe, development of parliamentary dimension of SEECP, as well as the defense issue regarding conversion of military capacities. We would especially like to single out Regional MARRI Forum as practical reflection of our good will to, within the framework of the SEECP, reinforce such an important dimension of the ownership over the Process of regional cooperation.
Dear Friends,
At this moment I believe that certain issues deserve to be specially emphasized:
When we speak about the situation in the region, we must emphasize that solution for the status of Kosovo is still a very sensitive issue. Bosnia and Herzegovina is interested for further stabilization of conditions and relations in the region. Permanent solution for the issue of Kosovo can only be reached through negotiations and it must meet the requirements of all included parties. In that sense we would like to remind you to the principles of regional cooperation contained in the Bucharest Charter: firm determination to transfer the region into areas of peace, security, stability and cooperation; fully abiding by the territorial integrity and sovereignity of all the countres in the region; development of peaceful and good neighboring relations in the region through reconciliation, respecting inviolability of the existing international borders, and peaceful resolving of all disputes, all in accordance with the international law. In this context, we, the participating countries in SEECP need to avoid misunderstanding especially when it comes to the issues that no country can resolve on its own.
Regarding our joint fight against organized crime, we are very encouraged with the initial results achieved in the joint campaign of the SEECP countries. However, in the context of providing stronger regional response to this evil which has a regional character it is also necessary to emphasize the role of the Bucharest SECI Center. We believe that the SECI Center has fully justified its existence and therefore we fully support the change of its legal status in order to make it possible for the Center to cooperate with European institutions such as EUROPOL and EUROJUST. Thus we would enter a new phase with stronger operational capacity, and therefore the contribution of the Center in the joint fight against the organized crime in the South-East Europe would be more capable.
Dear Friends,
Bosnia and Herzegovina has made a noticeable progress in many fields. Great efforts have been invested to speed up a process of reforms. It is in our direct interest to as soon as possible start negotiations with the European Union in order to conclude the Agreement on Stabilization and Association. There is no doubt that such a status of the country would give greater encouragement to legal and institutional adjustments on our road towards EU.
We believe that further progress of BiH into the European integration will be of use to the region as a whole in the same way as it is the case with the other countries in the region.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to, through active participation, contribute to strengthening of cooperation within the SEECP framework. Therefore, in the end I would like to express my sincere hope that the results of the today’s Summit, listed in the Conclusions of the Bucharest Declaration that we are adopting today will provide furter progress towards more efficient and more valuated process of cooperation in the South-East Europe. At the same time, I hope that the following Chairmanship of Greece will be marked by advancement of this process.
Thank you!"

I would like to greet you all during this, very special part of the year, the time of Advent, awaiting of Christmas – the celebration of the Christ's birth. I would also like to thank you all for being here today.
For us, Catholics, the Christmas has an exceptional meaning: first of all, it reinforces our faith into the Lord Almighty and His Son. On the other hand, it provides us with strength and inspires the love towards every human being and the mercy towards the needy ones. Unfortunately, in our country, those in need are numerous.
I would like to use this opportunity to inspire us to contemplate for a moment the values we share: love towards the family, thankfulness to God, esteem for the religious freedoms and the sincere respect of our differences.
Human and the laws of God have to provide the equal treatment for all in this country that has been suffering for centuries – for all of its peoples and citizens. It is a primary requirement for a better and happier future. The complete constitutional and legislative equality of each of the three constitutional peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina - something we all advocate, shall guarantee the right to existence and the right to own religion, culture and tradition, including the right to own holidays, the joy of which we would like to share with the others.
We live hoping for that more just society, a society of peoples that would be truly equal, and hoping that every man in this country will have a life that is worthy of human beings. We are hoping for the society in which we will be able to enjoy the fruits of our own labor, and in which we will be able to selflessly give our love and compassion to our fellow men.
I would like to remind you that in the past twelve months we have witnessed and participated in the events that in my opinion represent crucial tests, while at the same time, the key pillars for the development of our society. Another year of peace has passed, a year in which we have completed a high quality reform of the defense system and established the Ministry of Defense of BiH. We have established the state level Indirect Taxation Administration. For the first time ever, local authorities have, without the external assistance, organized and implemented local elections; without a single serious deficiency, I have to add. We have completed the reconstruction and officially opened the Old Bridge and the old part of Mostar. We have organized a high level International Investment Conference in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Stabilization Forces –SFOR have finished their mandate, and we are continuing the integration processes with the presence of the European Forces. Currently, we are active in implementing a whole line of other reforms in all of the society’s segments. To complete this is a necessity, and we have to finish them, for our own sake, but also in order to join the European Integrations.
We should believe and hope that during the year ahead, we will be able to make additional steps forward, towards bringing our country closer to the European Union and NATO; that we will be able to speed up the privatization process; to give a push to the foreign investments and enhance the social status of all our citizens, and especially to the most deprived and socially excluded ones. It is my firm belief that together, we have the will, strength, capability, determination and responsibility enough to go forward, to accept the European standards. In this country, we have a wide consensus to do so. It is our wish for all our citizens to have a better and a more dignifying life, and we wish for all the people in this country, young and old, to be able to rejoice life.
I would like to invite all of us to share the joy of Christmas with our loved ones and neighbors – I wish for other peoples in BiH to share the spirit of Christmas and a wish to spend these holly days in peace and kindness, prosperity, joy and happiness with us.
To all those celebrating Christmas, I wish a Marry Christmas, and to you all a very Happy New Year.
Thank you and cheers!"
15180,"ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF PRESIDENCY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA MR. BORISLAV PARAVAC, Regional Summit On “The Development of Inter-religious and Inter- ethnic Dialogue – An Importanat Factor for the S",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=15180&langTag=en-US,2004-12-09,"Mr. Chairman,
Distinguished Presidents,
Your Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the President of Albania, H.E. Mr. Alfred Moisiu and the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Koichiro Matsuura, for the invitation to participate at this Summit.
I am truly confident that the dialogue among peoples and religions in this region is the key factor thus contributing the everlasting peace, stability and progress. The tragic event Bosnia and Herzegovina has experienced in the past decade is yet another proof for that.
Inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue has to be a permanent process which will be beyond the sphere of verbal, contemplations and adopted declarations acknowledged into the everyday living. Without an open dialogue there is no true reconciliation.
All the peoples and cultures want to enjoy the real freedom, equality and harmony. Cherishing protecting and safeguarding the cultural heritage, as well as the freedom to practice the religion, to speak the languages and respect the traditions are the basic rights of every human being.
Cultural diversities are enriching our reality. The more we accept and respect it the better it will be for our stability, happiness and prosperity.
There should not be created the sense or the atmosphere where any of the ethnicities or the religions will be put to the moral suspect or culpability.
We have to faster release ourselves of the disputes from the past and overcome it through a dialogue between the nations, religions and states, especially that we are all strongly committed to the peace, stability, progress and access the Euro-Atlantic integrations.
Our major determinant will be to show the readiness to uphold and sustain mutual dialogue across a range of issues resolving them we advance further to the road of peace, democracy, security and stabilization in the region.
We must build coexistence fully recognizing mutual diversities. We will better respect our culture and religion if we understand others.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
People of Bosnia and Herzegovina are really aware that there is no prosperous future without a true reconciliation, tolerance, mutual respect and understanding. It could only be achieved through a dialogue which will fully be recognizing the identities of all the peoples living in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The best example that the dialogue is possible is the nearly passing of the Law on freedom of religion and legitimacy of churches and religious societies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For a country in the Balkans, which just a decade ago went out of the war it represented a tremendous progress. Every human being is guaranteed to the full enjoyment of freedom of expression and practicing a religion according to the best human rights standards encompassed in the international charters and conventions.
Theologians, religious dignitaries, believers and citizens, are the ones contributing in a legal manner to the spiritual background as a principle Bosnia and Herzegovina is functioning. Without the crucial background there is neither a vivid word, nor a proper dialogue such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As a fruit of the dialogue is the restoration of the cultural heritage, I would specially like to emphasize the reconstruction of the Old Bridge /Stari most/ in Mostar, with the immense support of UNESCO. I would also like to use the presence of the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Koichiro Matsuura to express on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina sincere gratitude.
We are aware that in the oncoming period we must work more decisively on promotion of the dialogue in order to prepare the young generations to live in tolerance fully recognizing all national and cultural identities.
Progress in information and communication technologies, network exchange, is crucial for building and contributing the greater understanding and respect of the different ethnic, cultural and religious knowledge and creativity especially amongst the young generations.
We are affirmative of building a praiseworthy society, with the highest ethical norms. Only in such a society we could create a genuine culture of living and dialogue.
Sincere and open dialogue between the people, national minorities and confessions, based on the equality, human rights protection and guarantees for freedom of expression beliefs, rule of law, recognition and respect for cultural diversity, will be the grounds on which we are going to build and develop true reconciliation and coexistence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am hopeful that the constructive exchange of views at the Tirana Summit will contribute to the better understanding between our peoples and cultures of this region and further improvement of the relationships between our countries.
I am optimistic in a belief that the results of the Summit will symbolize a clear signal to the international community about the readiness of the countries of South-East Europe, through an intensified dialogue, to further promote peace, stability and prosperity, not only in this part of Europe but much broadly."
15023,"Speech by H. E. dr. Dragan Covic, Croat Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the occasion of the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=15023&langTag=en-US,2004-11-24,"Your Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dear friends,
It is my great pleasure to welcome you on behalf of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and on my own behalf. I would like to sincerely thank you for your presence which lends solemnity to the Statehood Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Throughout its turbulent past, Bosnia and Herzegovina was experiencing numerous ordeals, mainly caused by global events, ordeals and historical events that were hurting, improving, changing and complementing… nevertheless, Bosnia and Herzegovina has always managed to survive, survive while carrying its basic feature… confirming the coexistence despite the differences.
Along with the tolerance and mutual respect, acknowledgment of others and those different, this shall be a main reference of our future.
By its internal structure, its historical, political, cultural, religious and ethnical diversity on one hand, and at the same time, the common coexistence on the other, Bosnia and Herzegovina should represent a formula that the modern Europe aspires to.
We are prepared to heal the consequences of our, often tragic past, while adhering to the principles that the modern Europe highly regards. Antifascism, fight against terrorism, organised crime, corruption and human trafficking still remain our primary mission, however, internally, we have to put additional efforts in regard to the return of refugees, protection of private property and return of dignity to the citizens deprived of their rights.
In that regard, respect for the differences, continuous dialogue and the establishing of mutual trust are a must.
Now, I would particularly like to emphasize that we have already fulfilled a significant part of tasks in the process of necessary reforms and that we have created a climate needed for the undergoing changes. Thus, we have opened the windows of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s future, and remain confident that we shall soon wide open the doors of the better future for all the peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who after all, deserve it.
Past should not be forgotten. On the contrary, we must learn from it, however, today we must direct our efforts towards the future, in order to create conditions needed, so that one day, our citizens would be able to rejoice living in this country.
I am quite convinced that you share my opinion when I say that together, we can achieve that.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nowadays, we are proud to say that there is a consensus present in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding the issue of the utmost importance and that is the path of our future, the path towards the European integrations.
This is the path towards the establishment of a law-respecting society and the rule of law.
That project enjoys the undivided support not only of the current authorities but of the opposition as well.
An additional reason to be pleased by, and an additional motivation is the fact that all three constituent peoples as well as the all the citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina unconditionally support the Euro-Atlantic integrations.
Nowadays, Bosnia and Herzegovina enjoys the support of International community; nevertheless, this relation is slowly changing, on day-to-day basis, converting from the tutorship into the partnership.
Regrettably, our country is still not completely fulfilling its international obligations, particularly regarding the cooperation with the Hague Tribunal.
We do hope that in the near future, after fulfilling the additional conditions needed for the start of negotiations on the accession to the European Community, we shall be able to achieve such a results, in the area of economy in particular, which will notably influence the quality of life of our citizens.
We simply expect, and will do our utmost, to achieve the economic growth that would ensure the use of our natural and human resources, increase the employment rate, and decrease the import and the economic inferiority present today.
It is my firm belief that we shall have the strength and will needed for such a transformation – after all, we have been intensively carrying out reforms needed, modernising army, police, customs, and financial flows, we are about to start building a highway that would provide for the increased use of our economic potentials: timber and wood industry, metal processing and chemical industry, power supply and tourism.
There is a merciless selection going on among those in power, to those committed to the reforms and their implementation on daily basis, and those who would still like to benefit from the tragic outcomes of our past and hinder, in every way possible, the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a European country.
When talking about the political consensus regarding our common future, I have to add that we are facing a huge problem: a certain number of officials publicly claiming one thing, whereas on the other hand secretly acting in a completely opposite way.
There is also a still present influence of the individuals outside the institutions that are not in favour of the normalization of the relations in our country. In order to address this serious problem, we expect the understanding and support as well as the vigorous intervention of the International Community as a whole.
Finally, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, please, allow me a personal notion.
Let us make progress, let us achieve results I was telling you about, then we will easily come to the agreement and understanding not only regarding the Statehood Day but the other national holidays as well.
That is the way we can achieve that the Statehood Day is not only respected, but also truly celebrated by all.
I sincerely hope that we will fulfil the responsibility we have towards our country and our future generations.
We can do it, and the most important is that we want it."
14976,Speech of the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mr. Borislav Paravac on the occasion of the Dayton agreement anniversary,https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=14976&langTag=en-US,2004-11-22,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Excellencies
Today we are entering the tenth year since the moment when, due to the great efforts of the Dayton Agreement Signatories, a difficult and tragic war conflict in BiH was terminated and when the peoples of this country and their representatives were given chance and hope to build the democratic, tolerant and prosperous society.
It is absolutely clear that a nine-year period is not sufficient to complete a very complex task of building the civil and democratic society, and particularly, overcoming the difficult problems of our past.
It is also clear, though not affirmed enough, that the achieved results in implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and its eleven Annexes, representing the social reforms process, are obvious and present. They represent solid grounds for maintaining a self-sustainable state, thus being able to enter the Regional and European integration.
Allow me to briefly indicate the following facts, being the confirmation of what has been done according to the obligations from the Dayton Agreement:
- Military aspect of the Dayton Agreement has been completely realised and permanent peace achieved on this territory
- Annex 3 of the Dayton Agreement has been completely realised by having passed the Law on Elections and the elections, organised and conducted by the domestic institutions, which represented the first and probably most important step in building a self-sustainable democratic society
- Both local authorities and international community put efforts and energy in realisation of the Annex 7 concerning return of refugees and displaced persons and property repossession. The encouraging fact is that about 98% property issues have been resolved, being however insufficient for a sustainable return, which will be a priority for BiH authorities in the oncoming period.
- International Police Task Force Agreement from the Annex 11 has been successfully realised
- With the aim of ensuring the human rights and freedoms in accordance with the European Convention, many efforts have been put into realising the obligations from the Dayton Peace Agreement Annex 6. In that regard, Human Rights Ombudsman offices on the state level have been established for the respective Entities, as well as the Human Rights Chamber, whose competences have been transferred to the BiH Constitutional Court at later stage.
- The key segment of the Dayton Agreement, representing the institutional basis for our existence and development is the BiH Constitution, included in the Annex 4 of the Document. The Dayton Constitution has defined Bosnia and Herzegovina as a complex state, which, in order to exist, must be internally stable and functional, particularly in terms of the local, Entity and state authorities relationships. Allow me to remind you that we have made many practical steps to that aim, in spite of the obstructions, in order to create a functional society, which understood the transfer of authorities from the Entity to the State level. Important BiH institutions such as the State Border Service, SIPA, OSA, BiH Court, Prosecutor’s Office have been established. Defence reform has been successfully realised and the Police Reform is also ongoing. When it was established, the Council of Ministers had four ministries, and today there are nine. These and other examples show that the Dayton Agreement, as well as BiH Constitution, is a framework wide enough to ensure the building a functional state. It also shows that the agreement amongst the elected representatives always makes it possible to upgrade and improve the existing solutions.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The whole process of building our society actually represents the Dayton Agreement Annex 10 implementation, with the key role of the international community in BiH headed by the High Representative. This is an opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all the former High Representatives, from Mr. Bildt to Mr. Ashdown, who is to finalise the role of the international community in the post-war reconstruction and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Your Excellencies,
This is an opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to you and the governments of your countries, being the most powerful countries of the world: USA, Russia, Great Britain, France and Germany, for signing the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, 21 November 1995, has taken the permanent place in Bosnia and Herzegovina history.
I would also like to express my appreciation to Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia, the countries which guaranteed the Dayton Agreement implementation with their signatures, which was of outmost importance, due to the their being our neighbours and the need for good cooperation in future, without which there is no stability and prosperity for either of them.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
There is still much to be done. First of all, we have to set impetus for economic development, attract foreign investments, and create conditions for better living of our citizens. Economic recovery is the most important task for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We certainly have to resolve the issue of cooperation with the ICTY in the Hague and bring to justice all the indictees, regardless of their nationality, since this is the precondition for our true and thorough reconciliation.
Finally, we are fully committed and absolutely agreed in passing the remaining our path towards the European Union and the Partnership for Peace as fast as possible. There is no alternative to this way. It is a path that ensures internal stability and chance to become an equal member of the great family of European countries.
Thank you!"
14849,"Address of Mr. Borislav Paravac, member of The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from The Republic of Srpska, on the occasion of taking over the duty of The Chairman of The Presidency of Bosnia and",https://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/gov/default.aspx?id=14849&langTag=en-US,2004-10-28,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Excellencies,
Dear Colleagues, Members of the BH Presidency
Today, when I take over the chairmanship over this Institution, in this formal, but also symbolical and essentially important act for the internal Bosnia and Herzegovina relations, allow me to present briefly, the way I see them, the main priorities of the Presidency activities in the next eight months.
This is the institution at the very top of the pyramid of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina and this fact obliges us to perform the duty of the collective head of the state with full responsibility, professionally and in accordance with the existing standards of democracy and, in our circumstances, also mutual respect and tolerance.
I would like the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be a prominent institution which will represent this country on the basis of the Constitution in the manner it is arranged in every other country, and in terms of power within the state, to show with its actions, based on the principles of agreement and consensus, that Bosnia and Herzegovina can exist as a complex and a functional state of the constituent peoples and equal Entities.
Starting from the mentioned principles and so far pragmatic experience, I believe the following activities shall be the priorities for the Presidency in the oncoming period:
-More intensive and comprehensive cooperation with the State, Entity and other BH institutions,
-Implementation and improvement of the foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
-Cooperation with the OHR and other international organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
-Further development of defence and security system,
-Economic development and economic revival of the country
I Cooperation with the State, Entity and Other BH Institutions
- The Presidency shall in the upcoming period have a more intensified and comprehensive communication primarily with the BH Parliamentary Assembly, specially through the active attitude towards the key issues which are going to be discussed in the Parliament. This is a country of a parliamentary democracy, thus our attitude towards the Parliament affirms the both the Assembly and the Presidency. On the other side, the Presidency is obliged to explain the most important issues concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the very Parliament, the issues like elements of foreign policy, BH Budget, legislation concerning the Central Bank, defense and security etc. The cooperation with the Council of Ministers and the respective Entities Governments is also very important in seeing all economic and overall development indicators as well as in carrying out foreign policy which, more than ever, must be in function of economy, particularly foreign investments. Development projects at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, entity as well as local communities level based on the foreign investments should be available to the Presidency which shall, within its activities, create the environment for their realisation.
II Foreign Policy Implementation
Starting from the constitutional competences of the Presidency in the field of foreign policy and the strategic paper ""General Guidelines and Priorities for Foreign Policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina"" (2003) I would like to emphasise the following activities in the oncoming period:
- The main foreign policy aims for BH shall remain the membership in the European Union and joining the ""Partnership for Peace"". These aims are fully supported by all political parties both position and opposition. I am convinced that this is also the wish shared by the majority of the BH citizens. This imposes an additional obligation to us to actively participate in realisation of these aims. We are aware of the obligations before us and determined to fulfill them. I am assuring you that I will, in performing the role of the Chairman of the BH Presidency, do my best to fulfill the requirements for concluding the Agreement on Stabilisation and Association between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union, as well as the requirements for BH admission to the Partnership for Peace.
The way to the European Union and other Euro-Atlantic integrations offers us a chance and an obligation to make the arrangements in the country according to the highest democratic standards and be an equal member of a great European countries family. Therefore, we do not want to be a burden for the European Union, but and equal partner in every way.
- The relations with the neighbours represent a priority in the foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Being already on the high level, these relations shall be further developed in the oncoming period. Particular efforts shall be put in the further improvement of economic exchange and development of inter-state transport, economic and other communications, as well as in finalisation of the process of border-related arrangements. The other open issues, return of refugees and resolving the property issues, disputable economic issues, etc, should be solved through the institutions, direct contacts and sessions of the Inter-state Councils in the shortest possible time. It is very important for the work of the Inter-state Councils with the neighbouring countries to be more efficient and operational in terms of resolving the concrete issues. A series of unresolved issues between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia imposes the need for a tripartite effort in their resolving, on which the Presidency shall particularly insist.
- Significant attention will be put to the relationships with the U.S.A. particularly in fighting the international terrorism and developing economic relationships. I am fully aware that the USA have played an important role in establishing the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that today they lead in a wide front against terrorism. Our maximum support to such efforts reflects in determination to concretely contribute that plan in accordance with our international commitments.
- The Presidency shall pay much attention to improvement of the relations with Southeastern European countries, Russian Federation as well as the members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries. Traditionally good relations with the Russian Federation should be more utilised in the sphere of economy and the observer position in the Organisation of Islamic Countries ensures Bosnia and Herzegovina more favorable conditions for economic cooperation.
Clearly, in realisation of the mentioned and other priorities in foreign policy, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall, as well as so far, closely cooperate with the BH Council of Ministers and particularly with the BH Ministry of Foreign Affairs being the most responsible operational body.
III Cooperation with the OHR and Other International Organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina
International institutions, headed by the Office of High Representative play a very important, key role in this post-war phase of Bosnia and Herzegovina development. This fact must be an important factor in the activities of all BH institutions, as well as the Presidency.
If the intention of the national institutions is to gradually take their own responsibility for the country then it is going to be through active attitude towards the international institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which must be partners to the local authorities. That is the only way of trust and restoring the authority of the national institutions and politicians in BaH.
Accordingly, the Presidency needs to develop active relationships and cooperation with the OHR and especially with the High Representative.
Keeping in mind the fact that our way towards the regional and European integrations is mostly conditioned by the cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia in the Hague, I would like to clearly express my standpoint: that cooperation must be be full and in accordance with the legal obligations and determinations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Presidency fully supports the transfer of the jurisdiction to the domestic judiciary. We believe it is a necessary process and we are sure that the BH judiciary is ready to perform this complex task. The judicial reforms, which the Presidency strongly supports, represent a guarantee for the above belief.
IV Defence and Security
In this segment the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall continue to strongly support the BH Ministry of Defence and other defence institutions on the state level, as well as the Reform Commission in a consistent implementation of the BH Defense Law and other reform solutions in this sphere, all with the aim of fulfilling the professional and technical requirements for joining of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the NATO Partnership for Peace Programme.
Within its constitutional and legal powers, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency shall continuously perform the role of civil command over the armed forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in the sense of fulfillment of the international obligations of BH in this sphere.
Given that the general political and security circumstances in BH have significantly improved, and an apparent progress made in establishing cooperation and mutual trust at all levels, the BH Presidency strongly supports the reduction of the international military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina and replacement of the SFOR with EU forces. In so far and also in the future negotiations with the EU and NATO representatives, the Presidency shall actively and precisely participate in the implementation of the EU Mission (ALTEA) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Presidency has clearly expressed its attitude towards further presence of the NATO troops in BH, particularly in terms of further support to the reforms in the sphere of defence and expert and material assistance to the defence structures in BH.
With the aim of fighting all forms of organised crime and BH contributing to the general fight against terrorism in the world, the Presidency shall continue to strongly support equipping and training of the State Agency for Investigations and Protection, State Border Service and the Ministry of Security in general.
The Presidency shall continuously insist on equipping the State Border Service for a full control over the state border, discovering, prevention and investigation of the cross-border crime, and SIPA to detect, prevent and investigate serious criminal acts of organised crime, terrorism, arrest the war crimes indictees and suspects for commercial crimes, money laundering and other criminal offences committed against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
V Economy
The key issue for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, its economic-social and political stability is ensuring the economic growth, which will lead to establishing a self-sustainable economy, reduction of unemployment and dependence on the international assistance, reduction of poverty and increase of the international competitiveness of the economy.
The answers to these challenges are to a significant extent offered in the “Midterm Development Strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina” the realisation of which should enable BH to become economically self-sustainable by 2007. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Presidency fully supports this strategic document and monitor and encourage its realisation.
We have to provide for a long-term sustainable growth of the GDP rates of over 5% per annum, develop production and services on the basis of modern technologies, innovations and expertise, increase international competitiveness of our economy. I believe that there is no fast economic recovery and development of a country without direct foreign investments, and I will particularly insist on that in all my contacts with the representatives of the other countries. The Presidency shall encourage reforms that will lead to creating a more favourable climate for direct international investments being the key factor of economic development and growth.
The Central bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina has proved to be one of the most successful institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina so far. The results of their activities are shown in maintaining the stable currency - convertible mark, which has led to monetary and price stability. In its further activities, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall support the activities of the Central bank bodies, based on the consistent application of the laws and the Currency Board rules, with the aims to improve functioning of the overall banking system.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your Excellencies,
Dear Colleagues, Members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina
I am fully committed to, together with you, continue realising these and other tasks that stand before us. I expect your full support in realisation of these aims and quality step forward in the work of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, being the only way of demonstrating, primarily to our people and citizens, as well as the entire European and world public that we are competent to perform this the most responsible function in the state. I would like to convey my sincere gratitude to Mr. Sulejman Tihic, the preceding chairman of the Presidency, as well as to Mr. Dragan Covic, for our joint work, wishing to put the so far good practice of agreements and mutual understanding to a higher level in our future activities.
Thank you for your attention!"
